   within the context of price comparison advertising. More specifically,
   the conceptual model explicates the effects of advertised selling and
   reference prices on buyers' internal reference prices, perceptions of
   quality, acquisition value, transaction value, and purchase and search
   intentions. Two experimental studies test the conceptual model. The
   results across these two studies, both individually and combined,
   support the hypothesis that buyers' internal reference prices are
   influenced by both advertised selling and reference prices as well as
   the buyers' perception of the product's quality, The authors also find
   that the effect of advertised selling price on buyers' acquisition value
   was mediated by their perceptions of transaction value, In addition, the
   effects of perceived transaction value on buyers' behavioral intentions
   were mediated by their acquisition value perceptions. The authors
   suggest directions for further research and implications for managers.

AB Many companies consider investments in complaint handling as means of
   increasing customer commitment and building customer loyalty. Firms are
   not well informed, however, on how to deal successfully with service
   failures or the impact of complaint handling strategies. In this study,
   the authors find that a majority of complaining customers were
   dissatisfied with recent complaint handling experiences. Using justice
   theory, the authors also demonstrate that customers evaluate complaint
   incidents in terms of the outcomes they receive, the procedures used to
   arrive at the outcomes, and the nature of the interpersonal treatment
   during the process. In turn, the authors develop and test competing
   hypotheses regarding the interplay between satisfaction with complaint
   handling and prior experience in shaping customer trust and commitment.
   The results support a quasi "brand equity" perspective-whereas
   satisfaction with complaint handling has a direct impact on trust and
   commitment, prior positive experiences mitigate, to a limited extent,
   the effects of poor complaint handling. Implications for managers and
   scholars are discussed.

AB Theoretical models of marketing ethics propose that people first must
   perceive the presence of an ethical issue before the process of ethical
   decision making can begin. Through the concept of ethical sensitivity,
   the authors explore why some marketing researchers and not others
   recognize and ascribe importance to the ethical content in their
   decision situations. The authors examine two rival definitions of
   ethical sensitivity and develop a measurement procedure capable of
   discriminating between them. The procedure then is tested on two
   populations (marketing students and marketing research practitioners),
   and several determinants of ethical sensitivity are investigated.
   Results indicate that the two definitions of ethical sensitivity are
   empirically equivalent. Furthermore, results show that the ethical
   sensitivity of marketing researchers is a positive function of
   organizational socialization and perspective taking, but a negative
   function of relativism and formal training in ethics.

AB The field of marketing strategy often makes the important assumption
   that marketing strategy should occur by first composing a plan on the
   basis of a careful review of environmental and firm information and then
   executing that plan. However, there are cases when the composition and
   execution of an action converge in time so that, in the limit, they
   occur simultaneously. The authors define such a convergence as
   improvisation and develop hypotheses to investigate the conditions in
   which improvisation is likely to occur and be effective. The authors
   test these hypotheses in a longitudinal study of new product development
   activities. Results show that organizational improvisation occurs
   moderately in organizations and that organizational memory level
   decreases and environmental turbulence level increases the incidence of
   improvisation. Results support traditional concerns that improvisation
   can reduce new product effectiveness but also indicate that
   environmental and organizational factors can reduce negative effects and
   sometimes create a positive effect for improvisation. These results
   suggest that, in some contexts, improvisation may be not only what
   organizations actually practice but also what they should practice to
   flourish.

   research that relates marketing organization to a business unit's

   explores how the organization and role of marketing vary across business
   contexts. After reviewing prior research and describing their
   methodology, the authors present a conceptual framework that relates
   aspects of marketing organization to the business environment. The
   authors then draw on field observations and prior research to describe
   variations and develop illustrative propositions for three
   organizational dimensions: (1) the structural location of marketing and
   sales groups, (2) the cross-functional dispersion of marketing
   activities, and (3) the relative power of the marketing subunit. The

AB Research on market orientation and organizational learning addresses how
   organizations adapt to their environments and develop competitive
   advantage. A significant void exists in current models of market
   orientation because none of the frameworks incorporates constructs
   related to innovation. The authors present a conceptual framework for
   incorporating constructs that pertain to innovation in market
   orientation research. Some of the critical relationships in this
   conceptual framework are tested among a sample of 9648 employees from 56
   organizations in a large agency of the U.S. federal government. The
   results indicate that higher levels of innovativeness in the firms'
   culture are associated with a greater capacity for adaptation and
   innovation (number of innovations successfully implemented). In
   addition, higher levels of innovativeness are associated with cultures
   that emphasize learning, development, and participative decision making.
   The authors make recommendations for incorporating constructs related to
   innovation into research on market orientation and organizational
   learning.

AB Most previous studies have focused on the linear effects of role
   stressors and job characteristics on salespersons' behavioral (e.g.,
   performance) and psychological (e.g., satisfaction) job outcomes.
   Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of Yerkes-Dodson law, activation
   theory, and overstimulation hypothesis, the author examines some
   unconventional hypotheses of curvilinear and interactional influences of
   role stressors (i.e., role conflict, ambiguity, and overload) and job
   characteristics (i.e., autonomy, feedback, task variety, and
   participation) on five key job outcomes of salespeople. Using data from
   salespeople across a range of smalt and large firms, the author finds
   that curvilinear and/or interactional influences are supported for job
   tension, turnover intentions, and performance but not for job
   satisfaction or organizational commitment. The findings specifically
   indicate support for the overstimulation hypothesis because the
   dysfunctional effects of role ambiguity tend to be amplified when
   autonomy, feedback, and task variety are increased. In addition, the
   results yield evidence of buffering effects because the adverse
   consequences of role conflict and overload appear to be buffered by task
   variety and feedback. Overall, the study highlights the inherent
   trade-offs for sates managers attempting to design jobs with positive
   job characteristics for salespersons facing high levels of role
   stressors. The author discusses the implications for theory and
   practice.

   salesperson job attitudes (job satisfaction and organizational
   commitment), role perceptions (ambiguity and conflict), in- and

   theoretical model that specifies the relationships between in- and
   extra-role performance and salesperson job satisfaction, organizational
   commitment, role perceptions, and turnover using cross-sectional data
   from a large sample (N = 672) of commission sales personnel. The results
   generally indicate that performance and job attitudes mediate the
   relationships between role perceptions and turnover. However, the most
   notable aspect of the findings is that they are consistent with the
   hypothesis that in- and extra-role performance are intertwined, with
   in-role performance serving as an antecedent of job satisfaction and
   organizational commitment, and extra-role performance as a consequence
   of these two variables. The authors discuss the implications of these
   findings for sales research.

   Although organizational innovativeness is believed to be a potential
   mediator of this market orientation-corporate performance relationship,
   much of the evidence to date remains anecdotal or speculative. In this
   context, the authors present a systematic framework to test the
   postulated "market orientation-innovation-performance" chain. To this
   end, the direct causality assumption of market orientation on
   organizational performance is examined with Narver and Slater's (1990)
   market orientation framework. Moreover, the authors take a componentwise
   approach and examine how the three core components of market orientation
   (customer orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional
   coordination) affect the two core components of organizational
   innovativeness (technical versus administrative) en route to affecting
   corporate performance. Using banking industry data, the authors
   empirically test and substantiate innovation's mediating role in the

AB In this article, the authors examine the roles that price, performance,
   and expectations play in determining satisfaction in a discrete service
   exchange. The authors maintain that the price fluctuations common to the
   many service industries that implement demand-oriented pricing, combined
   with the inherent heterogeneity of service performance, likely result in
   price-performance combinations that vary widely. Furthermore, the
   authors propose that the level of price-performance consistency in a
   service exchange moderates the relationship between performance
   expectations and subsequent performance and satisfaction judgments. When
   price and performance are consistent, expectations have an assimilation
   effect on performance and satisfaction judgments; when price and
   performance are inconsistent, expectations have no effect on performance
   and satisfaction judgments. To examine these issues, the authors develop
   a contingency model that they estimate using data from a multimedia
   experimental design. The results generally support the contingency
   framework and provide empirical support for normative guidelines that
   call for creating realistic performance expectations and offering

AB Although considerable research exists on consumer processing of
   nutrition labeling and package claims, less is known about consumer
   interpretation of nutrient content claims in advertising. This is
   important because product advertising often provides a significant first
   step for consumers in learning new nutrition information. Yet, unlike
   package claims, Nutrition Facts Panels are often not available for
   consumers during the processing of such advertising claims. Therefore,
   the authors examine the following research questions: (1) Do consumers
   misinterpret (i.e., overgeneralize) common nutrient content claims in
   advertising? If so, under what conditions does this occur? and (2) Can
   various types of disclosure statements remedy this problem? To address
   these questions, the authors interview a total of 365 primary food
   shoppers in three geographically dispersed malls in the United States in
   a between-subjects experiment. Misleading generalizations, beyond those
   of control ad claims, are found for general and specific nutrient
   content claims. Ad disclosure type, ad claim type, and nutrition
   knowledge all separately influence nutrient content and disease risk
   measures. Evaluative disclosures reduce misleading generalizations to a
   greater extent than do absolute or relative disclosures. The authors
   offer implications for public policy and food marketers.

   scholars have successfully struck marketing texts together, the sparks
   they have produced pertain primarily to marketplace phenomena rather
   than the academic marketing literature itself. Drawing on Bloom's
   "anxiety of influence" thesis, this article strikes together the
   published works of two prominent marketing thinkers, Theodore Levitt and
   Morris Holbrook. It argues that far from being positioned at opposite
   ends of the academic spectrum-pure versus applied-they are, in literary

   issues also serve as the organizing framework for this special issue
   Although the questions posed by these fundamental issues are durable,

AB The authors review more than 250 journal articles and books to establish
   what is and should be known about how advertising affects the
   consumer-how it works. They first deduce a taxonomy of models, discuss
   the theoretical principles of each class of models, and summarize their
   empirical findings. They then synthesize five generalizations about how
   advertising works and propose directions for further research.
   Advertising effects are classified into intermediate effects, for
   example, on consumer beliefs and attitudes, and behavioral effects,
   which relate to purchasing behavior, for example, on brand choice. The
   generalizations suggest that there is little support for any hierarchy,
   in the sense of temporal sequence, of effects. The authors propose that
   advertising effects should be studied in a space, with affect,
   cognition, and experience as the three dimensions. Advertising's
   positioning in this space should be determined by context, which
   reflects advertising's goal diversity, product category, competition,
   other aspects of mix, stage of product life cycle, and target market.

AB Both practitioners and academics understand that consumer loyalty and
   satisfaction are linked inextricably. They also understand that this
   relation is asymmetric. Although loyal consumers are most typically
   satisfied, satisfaction does not universally translate into loyalty. To
   explain the satisfaction-loyalty conundrum, the author investigates what
   aspect of the consumer satisfaction response has implications for
   loyalty and what portion of the loyalty response is due to this
   satisfaction component. The analysis concludes that satisfaction is a
   necessary step in loyalty formation but becomes less significant as
   loyalty begins to set through other mechanisms. These mechanisms,
   omitted from consideration in current models, include the roles of
   personal determinism ("fortitude") and social bonding at the
   institutional and personal level. When these additional factors are
   brought into account, ultimate loyalty emerges as a combination of
   perceived product superiority, personal fortitude, social bonding, and
   their synergistic effects. As each fails to be attained or is
   unattainable by individual firms that serve consumer markets, the
   potential for loyalty erodes. A disquieting conclusion from this
   analysis is that loyalty cannot be achieved or pursued as a reasonable
   goal by many providers because of the nature of the product category or
   consumer disinterest. For some firms, satisfaction is the only feasible
   float for which they should strive; thus, satisfaction remains a worthy
   pursuit among the consumer marketing community. The disparity between
   the pursuit of satisfaction versus loyalty, as well as the fundamental
   content of the loyalty response, poses several investigative directions
   for the next wave of postconsumption research.

AB In this article, the authors propose an integrative model of advertising
   persuasion that orders the major theories and empirically supported
   generalizations about persuasion that have been offered in the
   information-processing literature. The authors begin by reviewing this
   literature, placing particular emphasis on the assorted processes or
   mechanisms that have been suggested to mediate persuasion. To
   consolidate this material, the authors propose a framework that
   delineates three alternative strategies that people may use to process
   persuasive communications and form judgments, in which each strategy
   represents a different level of cognitive resources that is employed
   during message processing. In addition, the framework identifies a
   judgment correction stage that allows people to attempt to correct their
   initial judgments for biases that they perceive may have affected such
   judgments. The authors add to this by identifying particular processes
   that appear to mediate when and how these judgment formation and
   judgment correction processes operate. They also attempt to foster
   growth by specifying some of the critical issues and gaps in the
   knowledge that appear to impede further progress. Finally, the authors
   clarify how the proposed framework can inform the decisions advertising
   practitioners make about advertising execution and media factors.

AB In this article, the authors explore the origins and evolution of
   product markets from a sociocognitive perspective. Product markets are
   defined as socially constructed knowledge structures (i.e., product
   conceptual systems) that are shared among producers and
   consumers-sharing that enables consumers and producers to interact in
   the market. The fundamental thesis is that product markets are neither
   imposed nor orchestrated by producers or consumers but evolve from
   producer-consumer interaction feedback effects. Starting as unstable,
   incomplete, and disjointed conceptual systems held by market
   actors-which is revealed by the cacophony of uses, claims, and product
   standards that characterize emerging product markets-product markets
   become coherent as a result of consumers and producers making sense of
   each other's behaviors. The authors further argue that the sensemaking
   process is revealed in the stories that consumers and producers tell
   each other in published media, such as industry newspapers and consumer
   magazines, which the authors use as data sources. Specific hypotheses
   pertaining to the use of product category labels in published sources
   and the acceptability of different product category members throughout
   the development process are tested for the minivan market between 1982
   and 1988. The findings suggest that category stabilization causes
   significant differences between consumers and producers in how they use
   product category labels for emerging and preexisting categories. The
   findings also show that, as stabilization occurs around a category
   prototype, the acceptability of particular models changes without any
   physical changes to the models.

   is proposed whereby owners have more favorable responses than nonowners
   to the brand's extensions. The ownership effect occurs for upward and
   downward stretches of nonprestige brands and for upward stretches of
   prestige brands. For downward stretches of prestige brands, however, the
   ownership effect does not occur because of owners' desire to maintain
   brand exclusivity. In this situation, a subbranding strategy protects
   owners' parent brand attitudes from dilution. A field study and two lab

   analysis (GVA) framework to address marketing strategy decisions,
   especially with regard to strategies grounded in cooperative
   relationships. The GVA is a four-part model. Heterogeneous resources,
   positioning, the consequent attributes of exchange, and governance form
   all interact to determine success in creating and claiming value. The
   trade-offs among these factors are the core insight offered by the
   model. The authors illustrate these trade-offs and specify empirically

AB As the twenty-first century dawns, marketing is poised for revolutionary
   changes in its organizational context, as well as in its relationship
   with customers. Driven by a dynamic and knowledge-rich environment, the
   hierarchical organizations of the twentieth century are disaggregating
   into a variety of network forms, including infernal networks, vertical
   networks, intermarket networks, and opportunity networks. The role of
   marketing in each network is changing in profound ways. Marketing
   increasingly will be responsible for creating and managing new marketing
   knowledge, education, real-time market information systems, intrafirm
   integration, conflict resolution, technology forecasting, risk and
   investment analysis, transfer priding of tangibles and intangibles, and
   the coordination of the network's economic and social activities. It
   will explore new frontiers in multilateral marketing, reshape markets
   through technology convergence and electronic commerce, organize
   consumer communities, and aggregate consumer information and demand into
   saleable business assets. The most radical implication for marketing is
   the shift from being an agent of the seller to being an agent of the
   buyer, from being a marketer of goods and services to being a customer
   consultant and manager of his or her saleable consumption assets.

AB As marketing gains increasing prominence as an orientation that everyone
   in the organization shares and as a process that all functions
   participate in deploying, a critical issue that arises is the role of
   the marketing function. Specifically, what role should the marketing
   function play, and what value does the marketing function have, if any,
   in an organization that has a strong market orientation? The authors
   take the view that though a firm's market orientation is undeniably
   important, the marketing function should play a key role in managing
   several important connections between the customer and critical firm
   elements, including connecting the customer to (1) the product, (2)
   service delivery, and (3) financial accountability, The authors collect
   data from managers across six business functions and two time periods
   with respect to marketing's role, market orientation, the value of the
   marketing function, and perceived firm performance. The results show
   that the marketing function contributes to perceptions of firm financial
   performance, customer relationship performance, and new product
   performance beyond that explained by a firm's market orientation.
   Marketing's value, in turn, Is found to be a function of the degree to
   which it develops knowledge and skills in connecting the customer to the
   product and to financial accountability. For service firms, the value of
   the marketing function also is related positively to marketing's ability
   to connect the customer to service delivery.

AB Although there is increased interest in marketing's changing role within
   the firm, there is little empirical research that measures the influence
   of marketing or links marketing's role to situational factors. Drawing
   on contingency and institutional theories of intraorganizational power,
   the authors address the following question: In what circumstances does
   the marketing subunit have higher levels of influence? Results from a
   survey among U.S. and German companies indicate that (1) the marketing
   subunit still has substantial influence, (2) marketing's influence is
   related systematically to determinants other than individual managers'
   characteristics, and (3) institutional factors account for variance not
   explained by the determinants more commonly used in contingency theories
   in marketing. This implies that organizational dimensions are the result
   not only of adaptation to environmental conditions, but also of unique
   historical aspects that become institutionalized within the firm.

   performance. However, there is a dearth of research on process issues in

   to develop a (1) multifaceted conceptualization of MSM, (2) model of the
   antecedents and consequences of MSM, and (3) test of this model using
   data on more than 200 marketing mix-related decisions. After ruling out
   common method bias, the authors find that innovative culture is the
   fundamental antecedent of effective MSM. They also find that the
   components of MSM (situation analysis, comprehensiveness, emphasis on
   marketing assets and capabilities, cross-functional integration,
   communication quality, consensus commitment, and resource commitment)
   have differential effects on the outcomes measured, strategy creativity,
   organizational learning, and market performance, The authors find that
   strategy creativity affects market performance and organizational
   learning directly and as a mediator variable.

   immobile resources are more likely than less immobile resources to be
   redeployed. Furthermore, resources tend to be redeployed from the
   acquirer to the target more often than in the reverse direction.
   Finally, the effects of redeployment on subsequent product costs,
   product quality, product line breadth, geographic market coverage,
   market share, and profitability are examined. Cost-based synergies were
   minimally affected, but revenue-based synergies and overall firm
   performance were significantly influenced.

AB Several theories of relationship marketing propose that customers vary
   in their relationships with a firm on a continuum from transactional to
   highly relational bonds. Few empirical studies have segmented the
   customer base of an organization into low and high relational groups to
   assess how evaluations vary for these groups. Using structural equation
   analysis, the authors analyze the relationships of satisfaction, trust,
   and commitment to component satisfaction attitudes and future intentions
   for the customers of a New York off-Broadway repertory theater company.
   For the low relational customers (individual ticket buyers and
   occasional subscribers), overall satisfaction is the primary mediating
   construct between the component attitudes and future intentions. For the
   high relational customers (consistent subscribers), trust and
   commitment, rather than satisfaction, are the mediators between
   component attitudes and future intentions.

AB Instead of offering products or services alone, increasingly, firms and
   their partners are offering consumption systems. Consumption systems are
   offerings characterized by a significant product and service subsystem,
   as well as a pattern of consumption in which consumption occurs in
   multiple episodes over time. The authors develop a theoretical model for
   conceptualizing satisfaction with consumption systems and empirically
   test it using longitudinal data from 5206 automobile owners. Results
   show that an intertemporal examination of attribute-level performance,
   satisfaction, and behavioral intentions can improve an understanding of
   their relationships because these relationships change as the
   consumption of the product unfolds. For example, on the basis of their
   salience, attribute weights in determining satisfaction shift over time.
   Furthermore, the crossover effect of product and service satisfaction in
   determining intentions toward the manufacturer and the service provider
   is asymmetric, and this asymmetry reverses over time. Service
   satisfaction initially has a much larger impact in determining
   intentions toward the manufacturer, but later, product satisfaction is
   more influential in generating intentions toward the service provider
   and manufacturer. The results show that there is no direct link between
   satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Rather, satisfaction affects
   behavioral intentions in the future through a dual-mediation route.

   watched either original movie footage with smoking or control footage
   with the smoking edited out. Emotional reactions were recorded during
   viewing, and smoking-related thoughts, beliefs, and intent were assessed
   afterward. The findings support the Forbidden Fruit thesis, in that
   smoking (versus nonsmoking) scenes positively aroused the young viewers,
   enhanced their perceptions of smokers' social stature, and increased
   their intent to smoke. However, youths' opinions were malleable, and
   showing them an antismoking advertisement before the film effectively
   repositioned the smoking from forbidden to tainted, thereby nullifying
   the aforementioned effects, No support was obtained for the Excitation
   Transfer theory, which predicts that the positive arousal evoked by
   movie scenes would transfer to smokers who were depicted in those
   scenes. The authors discuss policy implications for film content and

   introduce it in a specific formulation known as Integrative Social

   resolving ethical issues that arise among different communities and is

   in boundary-spanning relationships and cross-cultural activities. The

AB Multimarket competition refers to competitive situations in which the
   same firms compete against each other in multiple markets. The theory of
   multimarket competition suggests that the phenomenon of mutual
   forbearance may reduce the market-level intensity of competition between
   two firms when the multimarket contact between them (the number of
   markets in which they compete) increases. Mutual forbearance, a form of
   tacit collusion in which firms avoid competitive attacks against those
   rivals they meet in multiple markets, is proposed to occur because
   multimarket competition increases the familiarity between firms and
   their ability to deter each other. In this article, the authors examine
   how multimarket contact increases familiarity and deterrence.
   Furthermore, they provide an extension of the theory of multimarket
   competition by developing a conceptual model that identifies competitive
   and market factors that moderate the relationship between the degree of
   multimarket contact and the intensity of competition. The authors also
   examine the implications of multimarket competition for marketing
   strategy in the context of two marketing strategy issues: product line
   rivalry and entry strategy.

AB Adapting to consumers from another culture is a quintessential task for
   marketers in the global marketplace. This research investigates
   marketers' processes of multicultural learning and adaptation using
   ethnographic methods in a longitudinal study of an ethnic marketplace in
   the United States. The authors derive an empirical model of individual
   marketer acculturation that consists of learning and translation
   processes, adaptation strategies, and their outcomes. The findings
   indicate that marketers serve as bicultural mediators, both
   accommodating their consumers and working to alter their consumption
   patterns to bring them into line with their own ethnic and larger U.S.
   national market customs. Marketers' adaptation to the cultural
   characteristics and needs of their clientele results in changes to
   themselves, their firms, consumers, and, ultimately, the marketplace.
   The authors contribute to a theoretical understanding of the complex
   dialectical relationships between marketers and consumers, which
   together constitute culture in the contemporary marketplace.

   maturational approach to parenting in Japan and by a greater emphasis on
   autonomy in the United States. Japanese mothers have late
   consumer-related developmental timetables and maintain greater control
   over their children's consumption than do American mothers, who
   encourage and expect the earlier development of independent consumption.

   analysis, and Ouchi's theoretical approach about the impact of
   environmental, company, and salesperson characteristics on the design of
   sales force control systems (outcome- versus behavior-based) and tests
   them on a data set of 270 German sales organizations. Many of the
   hypotheses receive empirical support. Sales force size, the only
   construct for which the author derives two opposing hypotheses, is
   related negatively to the use of behavior-based control in sales forces.
   Thus, the hypothesis derived from Ouchi's approach is supported, whereas
   the contradictory hypothesis from transaction cost analysis is rejected.

AB The authors present a phenomenological and longitudinal investigation of
   satisfaction, as revealed through consumers' ownership experiences with
   technological products. The study seeks to serve a provocative role in
   this mature research area by stepping back from the historically
   dominant comparison standards paradigm to question, invigorate, and, in
   certain ways, redirect satisfaction research along emergent lines.
   Although results show that the dominant paradigm of satisfaction and its
   competing models (i.e., those based on the confirmation/disconfirmation
   of preconsumption standards) are distinctly operative in some of the
   consumer cases, they are also found to be insufficient or even
   irrelevant in others. The authors consider several theoretical
   extensions in light of this learning and induct a new satisfaction
   paradigm. Overall, the findings support a more holistic,
   context-dependent, and dynamic process of satisfaction. This process is
   revealed as a multi-model, multi-modal blend of motivations, cognitions,
   emotions, and meanings, embedded in sociocultural settings, which
   transforms during progressive and regressive consumer-product
   interactions.

AB The authors examine whether reputation concerns affect how manufacturers
   structure their sales organization. Using reputation theory, they
   examine whether reputation-related perceptions and beliefs affect
   whether a manufacturer that currently uses an outside selling
   organization (i.e., a "rep") intends to vertically integrate the selling
   function or switch to a new rep. In particular, they propose that a
   manufacturer's intentions to replace its current manufacturers' rep with
   a company sales force or a different rep is a function of its
   perceptions of the reputation of itself and the rep and its beliefs
   about how high-reputation manufacturers in the industry typically
   organize their selling function. Survey data support the plausibility of
   these reputation-based arguments as factors that influence sales
   organization structure decisions. These results provide some important
   extensions to reputation theory. The authors discuss the study's
   implications for both managerial behavior and the literature on channels
   and organizational governance.

AB In this article, the authors focus on the defense strategies that firms
   pursue when threatened by rival new products in their markets. They
   investigate retaliation as a multidimensional construct. The integrative
   framework combines the analysis of the marketing instrument used to
   react and the speed and breadth of retaliation. Results emphasize the
   importance of the rival product's innovativeness in generating a
   reciprocal retaliation (a move in kind), though innovativeness slows the
   incumbent's reaction time. Market growth encourages rapid retaliation,
   especially on the product mix, whereas in concentrated markets, firms
   react less strongly on the product mix and exhibit slower reactions. The
   study also captures the phenomenon of incumbent inertia: Larger
   incumbents retaliate less strongly and more slowly.

   understand this complexity better, they explore the cross-sectional
   relationship of competition and retail structure for different types of
   retailers. Contrary to popular opinion, the findings suggest a positive
   association between the number of larger stores and the number and size
   of smaller stores. This implies a mutually beneficial relationship among

AB Territorial restrictions long have been the subject of intense policy
   debate. The central issue in this debate has been whether such
   distribution arrangements are deployed for efficiency or anticompetitive
   purposes. The authors add to the debate by broadening the existing
   conceptualization of business efficiency and providing evidence of the
   importance of efficiency considerations in the decision to deploy
   restrictions. In the past, efficiency often has been viewed narrowly, in
   terms of giving distributors incentives to provide free-rideable
   services. The authors show that information asymmetry and transaction
   costs also represent important efficiency-based explanations of
   territorial restrictions. With regard to anticompetitive concerns, their
   results show that manufacturers are more likely to use territorial
   restrictions when they face competition ex ante. Ultimately, this may
   reduce interbrand competition. From a public policy perspective, their
   pattern of results supports the current rule of reason treatment of
   territorial restrictions in the United States. At the same time it
   questions the current European policy of per se illegality.

   change the dimensionality of the consumer decision. The planning process
   begins with an extensive situation analysis. The factors identified in
   the situation analysis are woven into the economic webs surrounding the
   new product. The webs are mapped into Bayesian networks that can be
   updated as events unfold and used to simulate the impact that changes in
   assumptions underlying the web have on the prospects for the new
   product. The author illustrates this method using a historical case
   regarding the introduction of videotape recorders by Sony and JVC and a
   contemporary case of the introduction of electric vehicles. The author

   communications aimed at influencing the perceptions and attitudes of
   industry stakeholders. The growth of the Internet points to the expanded
   importance of preannouncements. With an investigation of 265 chief
   executive officers (CEOs) and presidents from manufacturers of new
   products, the authors examine the effects of three firm-specific factors
   (first-mover predisposition, firm information interactivity, and
   competitive equity building) and one environmental construct (industry
   dynamism) on a firm's propensity to preannounce its future intended
   actions. The results indicate that competitive equity building, defined
   as a firm's tendency to pursue a high-profile leadership position within
   its industry, is the main driver of a firm's propensity to preannounce.
   Future directions for research include the development of a normative
   preannouncement framework and investigation of the role of

AB New products provide increased sales, profits, and competitive strength
   for most organizations. However, nearly 50% of the new products that are
   introduced each year fail. Organizations thus find themselves in a
   double bind. On the one hand they must innovate consistently to remain
   competitive, but on the other hand innovation is risky and expensive.
   Many organizations are forming business alliances to quicken the pace of
   and reduce risks associated with innovation. Yet by some estimates, 70%
   of these alliances fail. Many of the prescriptions for successful
   alliance management clash with recommendations for effective innovation
   management. The authors develop testable hypotheses by integrating the
   new products and alliance literature. A construct-cooperative
   competency-derived from related concepts of mutual adjustment,
   absorptive capacity, and relational capability is posited as the key
   factor affecting new product development success, regardless of whether
   it is an intra- or interfirm endeavor. The authors test the model with
   data from a sample survey in the semiconductor manufacturing context and
   replicate it in the health care sector. The antecedents of cooperative
   competency-formalized and clannish administration, mutual dependence,
   and institutional support-are revealed empirically and substantiated.
   The authors identify the importance and means of developing interfirm
   cooperation.

AB Conventional marketing wisdom holds that a customer orientation provides
   a firm with a better understanding of its customers, which subsequently
   leads to enhanced customer satisfaction and firm performance. However,
   there are cautions that being too customer focused can lead to inertia,
   and anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be better to "ignore your
   customer" when developing new products. Building on the market
   orientation research stream, the authors examine the impact of three
   alternative strategic orientations-customer orientation, competitor
   orientation, and product orientation-on a variety of subjective and
   objective measures of performance in the nonprofit professional theater
   industry, which is marked by high rates of artistic innovation and
   largely unpredictable customer preferences. The results indicate that
   the association between strategic orientation and performance varies
   depending on the type of performance measure used. However, the most
   unambiguous result is that a customer orientation exhibits a negative
   association with subscriber ticket sales, total income, and net
   surplus/deficit.

AB New product quality has been found to have a major influence on the
   market success and profitability of a new product. Firms are
   increasingly using cross-functional teams for product development in
   hopes of improving product quality, yet researchers know little about
   how such teams affect quality. The author proposes and tests a series of
   hypotheses regarding how new product quality is affected by team
   characteristics (functional diversity and information integration) and
   contextual influences (time pressure, product innovativeness from the
   firm's perspective, customers' influence on the product development
   process, and quality orientation in the firm). The findings reveal that
   quality is positively related to information integration in the team,
   customers' influence on the product development process, and quality
   orientation in the firm. New product quality is negatively influenced by
   the innovativeness of the new product from the firm's perspective.
   However, information integration mitigates the negative effect of
   innovativeness on quality. Quality orientation weakens the relationship
   between information integration and quality. Time pressure and
   functional diversity do not have any effect on product quality.

AB To understand mechanisms that govern the productivity and quality of

   distinction between frontline productivity and quality, (2) proposes an
   extended role theory-based model for mapping the influence of key
   antecedents and consequences of FLE productivity and quality, and (3)
   examines the effects of coping resources-boss support and task
   control-in helping employees cope with the inherent productivity-quality
   tension in frontline jobs. Using data from 159 customer service and 147
   bill collection representatives, the author examines proposed hypotheses
   through multiple-group path analysis. The results indicate support for
   the distinction between productivity and quality. Moreover, with
   increasing burnout levels, FLEs are found to maintain their productivity
   levels while their quality deteriorates directly. Relative to boss
   support, task control emerges as a more powerful resource in aiding FLEs
   in coping with role tension. Key implications for theory and practice
   regarding FLE management and effectiveness are discussed.

AB It is widely held that a customer-oriented firm is more likely to
   deliver exceptional service quality and create satisfied customers.
   However, little research has addressed the question of how the
   orientation can be disseminated among employees throughout the firm.
   This dissemination is especially important in service firms in which
   frontline, customer contact employees are responsible for translating a
   customer-oriented strategy into quality service. The authors propose a
   structural model that explains how service firms can disseminate their
   customer-oriented strategy by aligning the strategy with specific
   management- and employee-initiated control mechanisms (i.e.,
   formalization, empowerment, behavior-based employee evaluation, and work
   group socialization) that lead to increased commitment and shared values
   on the part of customer contact employees. The findings indicate that
   there are three "corridors of influence" between customer-oriented
   strategy and shared employee values. The dominant corridor, which
   focuses on dual (management- and employee-initiated) control, emphasizes
   the importance of work group socialization and organizational commitment
   in the dissemination of customer-oriented strategy. A secondary corridor
   focuses on two management-initiated control mechanisms: formalization
   and behavior-based evaluation. The final corridor, which focuses on the
   empowerment of customer contact employees, has a more limited impact
   than originally hypothesized. The authors discuss implications for the
   implementation of customer-oriented strategy and the management of
   customer contact employees, along with several directions for further
   research.

   also investigate how various combinations of these governance mechanisms
   affect opportunistic behavior in hotel channels. Overall, the results
   generally support emphasizing relational norms in managing opportunism
   in marketing channels. The results also indicate that opportunism can be

   mechanisms to solve problems that arise under asymmetric information. A
   firm or individual credibly communicates the level of some unobservable
   element in a transaction by providing an observable signal. When applied
   to conveying product quality information, this issue is of particular
   interest to the discipline of marketing. In this article, the authors
   focus on the ways a firm may signal the unobservable quality of its
   products through several marketing-mix variables. The authors develop a
   typology that classifies signals and discuss the available empirical
   evidence on the signaling properties of several marketing variables.
   They consider managerial implications of signaling and outline an agenda

   incongruent extensions. In a study of four highly regarded brands,
   participants who viewed brand extension advertisements five times
   evaluated incongruent extensions more positively, expressed higher usage
   intentions, indicated more favorable consistency judgments, and
   exhibited increased elaboration and more positive elaboration than did
   participants who viewed the advertisements only once. This relationship
   was attenuated for highly incongruent extensions, for which the
   advertisement evoked primarily peripheral brand associations instead of
   benefit brand associations. However, for moderately incongruent
   extensions, advertisements that evoked either peripheral or benefit
   associations were equally effective. Process measures indicate the

AB Slotting allowances and fees have attracted considerable attention and
   controversy since their introduction in the mid-1980s. Currently, two
   schools of thought dominate the debate on these fees. One considers them
   a tool for improving distribution efficiency, whereas the other proposes
   that the fees operate as a mechanism for enhancing market power and
   damaging competition. Managers and public policymakers are uncertain as
   to the effects of slotting fees and the appropriate strategy to adopt.
   The current study attempts to inform the debate surrounding slotting
   fees and provide guidance to managers and policymakers. The authors
   summarize the arguments of the two schools and investigate the views of
   managers toward them through a large-scale survey of manufacturer,
   wholesaler, and retailer grocery institutions. Though exploratory, the
   findings suggest that slotting fees shift the risk of new product
   introductions and help apportion the demand and supply of new products.
   The authors find that slotting fees are also associated with the
   exercise of retailer market power, are applied in a discriminatory
   fashion, and lead to higher retail prices. The authors encourage further
   research that examines slotting fees and their effects and indicate
   prospective directions.

AB A common perception in the field of innovation is that large, incumbent
   firms rarely introduce radical product innovations. Such firms tend to
   solidify their market positions with relatively incremental innovations.
   They may even turn away entrepreneurs who come up with radical
   innovations, though they themselves had such entrepreneurial roots. As a
   result, radical innovations tend to come from small firms, the
   outsiders. This thesis, which we term the "incumbent's curse" is
   commonly accepted in academic and popular accounts of radical
   innovation. This topic is important, because radical product innovation
   is an engine of economic growth that has created entire industries and
   brought down giants while catapulting small firms to market leadership.
   Yet a review of the literature suggests that the evidence for the
   incumbent's curse is based on anecdotes and scattered case studies of
   highly specialized innovations. It is not clear if it applies widely
   across several product categories. The authors reexamine the incumbent's
   curse using a historical analysis of a relatively large number of
   radical innovations in the consumer durables and office products
   categories, In particular, the authors seek to answer the following
   questions: (1) How prevalent is this phenomenon? What percentage of
   radical innovations do incumbents versus nonincumbents introduce? What
   percentage of radical innovations do small firms versus large firms
   introduce? (2) Is the phenomenon a curse that invariably afflicts large
   incumbents in current industries? Is it driven by incumbency or size?
   and (3) How consistent is the phenomenon? Has the increasing size and
   complexity of firms over time accentuated it? Does it vary across
   national boundaries? Results from the study suggest that conventional
   wisdom about the incumbent's curse may not always be valid.

AB This article focuses on the sale of a product across channels that are
   entered sequentially. Using a two-channel model, the authors derive the
   optimal time to enter the second channel and then obtain a specific
   parametric solution for movie distributors regarding theater attendance
   and subsequent sales to video stores. Using data from 35 movies, the
   authors estimate exponential sales curves for both theater attendance
   and video rentals and demonstrate how knowledge of the sales parameters
   in the first channel (theaters) helps predict sales in the second
   channel (video rentals). Finally, from the movie distributor's
   perspective, the authors calculate optimal release times based on the
   model and its estimated parameters. The results suggest that profits
   would increase if movies were released to video sooner than is the

   membership's commitment to the relationship as well as the membership's

   correlation between the associations' relationship-building efforts and
   their members' relationship behaviors (membership retention,
   exchange-based participation, and cooperatively based coproduction).
   Confirmatory factor analysis validates the commitment measures, and
   structural equations analysis indicates that normative and affective
   commitment partially mediate the effects of selected

AB Creating and maintaining customer loyalty has become a strategic mandate

   differ in their value to a firm, and therefore customer retention and
   loyalty-building efforts should not necessarily be targeted to all
   customers of a firm. Given these sentiments, it is becoming increasingly
   necessary for firms to have a thorough understanding of their customer
   base. Yet current knowledge is limited in providing insights to firms
   regarding the differences within their customer base. This research
   comprises two studies in which the authors examine the differences among
   internal customer groups in a service industry. As theory suggests and
   as is empirically validated here, customers who have switched service
   providers because of dissatisfaction seem to differ significantly from
   other customer groups in their satisfaction and loyalty behaviors, The
   findings offer some interesting implications for both marketing theory

AB The goal of this study is to develop and test a conceptualization of
   sales call anxiety (SCA) on the basis of current insights from the
   cognitive approach to social anxiety. Sales call anxiety is an
   irrepressible fear of being negatively evaluated and rejected by a
   customer, and it is coupled with a desire to avoid undertaking specific
   functional actions in selling situations. The authors present and test a
   model of SCA in two selling situations known to have threatening
   consequences for salespeople: canvasing and closing. The authors find
   that SCA consists of four components: negative self-evaluations,
   negative evaluations from customers, awareness of physiological symptoms
   (e.g., a queasy stomach, shaky voice, blushing), and protective actions
   (e.g., avoiding eye contact, fiddling with the hands. shunning
   self-disclosures). The authors show that these dimensions are functions
   of negative affectivity and anxiety-provoking contextual cues and that
   they negatively influenced the performance of 189 mortgage salespeople.

AB Relationship marketing emphasizes the need for maintaining long-term
   customer relationships. It is beneficial, in general, to serve customers
   over a longer time, especially in a contractual relationship. However,
   it is not clear whether some of the findings observed in a contractual
   setting hold good in noncontractual scenarios: relationships between a
   seller and a buyer that are not governed by a contract or membership.
   The authors offer four different propositions in this study and
   subsequently test each one in a noncontractual context. The four
   propositions relate to whether (1) there exists a strong positive
   customer lifetime-profitability relationship, (2) profits increase over
   time, (3) the costs of serving long-life customers are less, and (4)
   long-life customers pay higher prices. The authors develop arguments
   both for and against each of the propositions. The data for this study,
   obtained from a large catalog retailer, cover a three-year window and
   are recorded on a daily basis. The empirical findings observed in this
   study challenge all the expectations derived from the literature.
   Long-life customers are not necessarily profitable customers. The
   authors develop plausible explanations for findings that go against the
   available evidence in the literature and identify three indicators
   through discriminant analysis that can help managers focus their efforts
   on more profitable customers. The authors draw several marketing
   implications and acknowledge the limitations of the study.

AB Vertically coordinated ties are purportedly effective responses to the
   uncertainties of fast-changing purchasing environments. Building on
   transaction costs arguments and related work in marketing, the authors
   analyze vertical coordination as a response to external uncertainty and
   show that its effectiveness is highly contingent on the magnitude of the
   safeguarding problem present. Indeed, its beneficial effects can be
   overwhelmed by the consequential increase in trading hazards. The
   authors use survey data from a sample of 161 industrial buyers to test
   the hypotheses. When specific investments are modest, greater vertical
   coordination diminishes transaction difficulties in adapting to high
   environmental uncertainty. Conversely, vertical coordination increases
   transaction difficulties when firms adapt to high environmental
   uncertainty and specific investments are substantial. The authors
   discuss the importance of these results for transaction cost theory and
   develop the results into a managerial decision framework for designing
   purchasing ties that balances safeguarding and adaptation.

AB Are monetary savings the only explanation for consumer response to a
   sales promotion? If not, how do the different consumer benefits of a
   sales promotion influence its effectiveness? To address the first
   question, this research builds a framework of the multiple consumer
   benefits of a sales promotion. Through a series of measurement studies,
   the authors find that monetary and nonmonetary promotions provide
   consumers with different levels of three hedonic benefits (opportunities
   for value expression, entertainment, and exploration) and three
   utilitarian benefits (savings, higher product quality, and improved
   shopping convenience). To address the second question, the authors
   develop a benefit congruency framework, which argues that a sales
   promotion's effectiveness is determined by the utilitarian or hedonic
   nature of the benefits it delivers and the congruence these benefits
   have with the promoted product. Among other results, two choice
   experiments show that, as predicted for high-equity brands, monetary
   promotions are more effective for utilitarian products than for hedonic
   products. The authors then discuss the implications of the multibenefit
   and the benefit congruency frameworks for understanding consumer
   responses to sales promotions, reexamining the value of
   everyday-low-price policies, and designing more effective sales
   promotions.

   marketers' processes of producing cultural meanings at a western stock

   attracting a nonranch audience; juxtaposing business, education, and

   using business activity as the basis for claims of authenticity.
   Marketing implications center on tapping into rich sources of cultural
   meaning by (1) attending to the cultural dimensions of economic
   activity, (2) taking industry as the unit of analysis through an
   examination of representations of production in market discourses and
   practices, (3) expanding history from a research method to a source of

AB The long-held precept of equating entry barriers with sustainable
   incumbent advantage increasingly is met with skepticism as incidents of
   innovative late entrants leapfrogging over market incumbents become more
   pervasive across industries. Ostensibly, the reassessment of the
   traditional assumptions underlying entry barrier strategy has become
   imperative; to this end, the authors present a framework that
   investigates the contingent effects of incumbents' barrier building on
   their own performance. Specifically, the authors examine five types of
   entry barriers (capital requirements, cost advantages, switching costs,
   distribution access; and proprietary assets) for the nature of their
   impact in the following presupposed yet unresolved roles: (1) as
   effectual versus ineffectual entry deterrents and (2) as enablers versus
   inhibitors of incumbents' innovativeness. In addition, the authors take
   other variables into account (i.e., competitors' innovativeness and
   incumbents' market and technological orientation to identify the
   contingencies of the framework. Using data from Korean consumer product
   industries, the authors empirically test and substantiate the variable
   (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) impact of entry barriers on
   incumbents' performance.

AB Although strategy exists at multiple levels in a firm (corporate,
   business, and functional), there is a dearth of research in marketing
   literature that focuses on the dependency among strategy at different
   levels. The authors address this issue by examining the relationship
   between deconglomeration and marketing strategy. Deconglomeration refers
   to the divestiture behavior of a conglomerate firm and the
   transformation of its business portfolio from one that is largely
   composed of several unrelated businesses to one composed of fewer and
   related businesses. Drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives, the
   authors propose a conceptual model delineating the environmental and
   organizational drivers of deconglomeration and its outcomes for
   marketing. The authors suggest that after deconglomeration, (1) a firm
   can be expected to be more competitor and customer oriented, (2)
   multimarket contact with competing firms and seller concentration will
   increase, (3) businesses retained by the firm will be more innovative
   and place greater emphasis on advertising compared with sales promotion,
   and (4) the firm's culture may become more externally oriented.
   Furthermore, the locus of decision making for marketing strategy may
   shift more toward senior management levels. In summary, changes in a
   firm's corporate strategy could lead to significant changes in the
   marketing strategy of its business units.

AB Academic literature and business practice are directing increased
   attention to the importance of creating value in buyer-supplier
   relationships. One method for creating value is to reduce costs in

   supplier behaviors and the management of suppliers affect a customer
   firm's direct product, acquisition, and operations costs. The model
   proposes that these costs mediate the relationship between
   buyer-supplier relationship behaviors and the customer firm's intentions
   to expand future purchases from the supplier. The model is tested on
   data collected from almost 500 buying organizations in the United States
   and Germany. The results indicate that increased communication
   frequency, different forms of supplier accommodation, product quality,
   and the geographic closeness of the supplier's facilities to the
   customer's buying location lower customer firm costs. In addition,
   customer firms intend to increase purchases from suppliers that provide
   value by lowering each of these costs.

AB Much research has focused on how consumers and competitors respond to
   short-term changes in advertising and promotion. In contrast, the
   authors use Procter & Gamble's (P&G's) value pricing strategy as an
   opportunity to study consumer and competitor response to a major,
   sustained change in marketing-mix strategy. They compile data across 24
   categories in which P&G has a significant market share, covering the
   period from 1990 to 1996, during which P&G instituted major cuts in
   deals and coupons and substantial increases in advertising. The authors
   estimate an econometric model to trace how consumers and competitors
   react to such changes. For the average brand, the authors find that
   deals and coupons increase market penetration and surprisingly have
   little impact on customer retention as measured by share-of-category
   requirements and category usage. For the average brand, advertising
   works primarily by increasing penetration, but its effect is weaker than
   that of promotion. The authors find that competitor response is related
   to how strongly the competitor's market share is affected by the change
   in marketing mix and the competitor's own response and to structural
   factors such as market share position and multimarket contact. The net
   impact of these consumer and competitor responses is a decrease in
   market share for the company that institutes sustained decreases in
   promotion coupled with increases in advertising.

AB An important decision facing sales managers today is precisely how much
   pricing authority should be delegated to the sales force. Received
   theory suggests that the salesperson's superior information about
   customers' valuations will invariably make price delegation profitable
   for the firm. The empirical evidence, however, reveals that firms that
   grant full pricing authority generate lower profits than firms that
   limit pricing authority. Given this state of affairs, the author
   develops and analyzes a formal model that examines the optimality of
   delegating pricing authority to the sales force. The model preserves the
   notion of superior information assumed in the literature but considers
   as well a negative feature of much concern to practitioners, namely the
   suboptimal substitution of selling effort by price discounting. The
   model reveals that providing the salesperson with full pricing authority
   is not always optimal. Specifically in some environments, it is
   appropriate to limit pricing authority because this decision forces the
   salesperson to target high-valuation customers. In addition, the model
   predicts that the commission rate offered to the salesperson should be
   higher when pricing authority is limited. The author concludes by
   summarizing the context, calculus, and implications of the model with a
   view to assisting managers charged with the price-delegation decision.

AB The objective of this article is to determine whether national brand
   promotions and store brands attract the same value-conscious consumers,
   which would aggravate channel conflict between manufacturers and
   retailers. The authors identify psychographic and demographic traits
   that potentially drive usage of store brands and national brand
   promotions. They then develop a framework and structural equation model
   to study the association of these traits with store brand and national
   brand promotion usage. The authors find that though demographics do not
   influence these behaviors directly, they have significant associations
   with psychographic characteristics and therefore are useful for market
   targeting. Most important, usage of store brands and usage of
   promotions, particularly out-of-store promotions, are associated with
   different psychographics. Store brand use correlates mainly with traits
   related to economic benefits and costs, whereas the use of out-of-store
   promotions is associated mainly with traits related to hedonic benefits
   and costs. These differences result in four well-defined and
   identifiable consumer segments: deal-focused consumers, store
   brand-focused consumers, deal and store brand users (use-all), and
   nonusers of both store brands and deals (use-none). Therefore,
   manufacturers and retailers have the opportunity to either avoid each
   other or compete head to head, depending on which segment they target.

AB In this article, the authors examine the acquisition and utilization of
   information in new product alliances. Drawing from research in social
   network theory with a focus on the strength-of-ties literature, the
   authors suggest that horizontal alliances have lower levels of
   relational embeddedness and higher levels of knowledge redundancy than
   vertical alliances. The authors then suggest that though embeddedness
   enhances both the acquisition and utilization of information in
   alliances, redundancy diminishes information acquisition but enhances
   information utilization. The authors test these ideas using a sample of
   106 U.S. firms that recently have participated in new product alliances.
   Although the results are broadly supportive of the predictions, they are
   also surprising because they question key underlying assumptions of the
   strength-of-ties literature, For example, closely tied individual actors
   are typically assumed to share both high levels of embeddedness and high
   levels of redundancy, but the present research finds that this
   assumption does not hold for organizational actors. The authors discuss
   the implications of these findings specifically for new product
   alliances and for research on tie strength among organizations in
   general.

   market charters of existing business units. In a longitudinal study, the

   from a freshly created unit to an established business unit, the authors
   found support for the prediction that the former organizational

   switching costs, interpersonal relationships do not play the frequently

   Recent cases in Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America bear testimony

   results demonstrate the contingent nature of the influence of market
   orientation and strategic flexibility on firm performance after a crisis
   has occurred. As hypothesized, market orientation has an adverse effect
   on firm performance after a crisis. This effect is moderated by demand
   and technological uncertainty and is enhanced by competitive intensity.
   In contrast, strategic flexibility has a positive influence on firm
   performance after a crisis, which is enhanced by competitive intensity
   and moderated by demand and technological uncertainty. It seems that
   market orientation and strategic flexibility complement each other in
   their efficacy to help firms manage varying environmental conditions.

AB Estimating current profitability at the individual customer level is
   important to distinguish the more profitable customers from the less
   profitable ones. This is also a first step in developing estimates of
   customers' lifetime values. This exercise, however, takes on additional
   complexities when applied to an intermediary in a supply chain, such as
   a distributor, because the costs of servicing a retail customer include
   not only those incurred directly in servicing this customer but also
   those incurred by the distributor in dealing with its own vendors for
   goods supplied to this customer. The authors develop a general model and

   characteristics in a supply chain. The authors show how heterogeneity in

AB Business-to-business electronic markets have a profound influence on the
   manner in which organizational buyers and sellers interact. As a result,
   it is important to develop an understanding of the behaviors of firms
   that participate in these markets. The authors develop a typology for
   the nature of organizational participation to explain the behaviors of
   user firms in business-to-business electronic markets. The proposed
   model hypothesizes that the nature of participation depends on
   organizational motivation and ability. The authors conceptualize
   motivational factors in terms of efficiency and legitimacy motivations
   and theorize that ability results from the influence of organizational
   learning and information technology capabilities. They test the model
   using organizational-level survey data from jewelry traders that conduct
   business in an electronic market. The results indicate that both
   motivation and ability are important in determining the nature of
   participation; however, the level of influence of motivation and ability
   varies with the nature of participation.

AB Through qualitative and empirical research, the authors find that the
   service quality construct conforms to the structure of a third-order
   factor model that ties service quality perceptions to distinct and
   actionable dimensions: outcome, interaction, and environmental quality.
   In turn, each has three subdimensions that define the basis of service
   quality perceptions. The authors further suggest that for each of these
   subdimensions to contribute to improved service quality perceptions, the
   quality received by consumers must be perceived to be reliable,
   responsive, and empathetic. The authors test and support this
   conceptualization across four service industries. They consider the
   research and managerial implications of the study and its limitations.

AB Most supermarket categories are cluttered with items, or stockkeeping
   units (SKUs), that differ very little at the attribute level. Previous
   research has found that reductions (up to 54%) in the number of
   low-selling SKUs need not affect perceptions of variety and therefore
   sales, significantly. In this research, the authors analyze data from a
   natural experiment conducted by an online grocer, in which 94% of the
   categories experienced dramatic cuts in the number of SKUs offered,
   particularly low-selling SKUs, Sales were indeed affected dramatically,
   increasing an average of 11% across the 42 categories examined. Sales
   rose in more than two-thirds of these categories, nearly half of which
   experienced an increase of 10% or more; 75% of households increased
   their overall expenditures after the cut in SKUs. In turn, the authors
   examine how different types of SKU reductions-defined by how the cuts
   affect the available attributes or features of a category (e.g., the
   number of brands)-affected purchase behavior differently. The results
   indicate that consumers experienced divergent reactions to the reduction
   in sizes, but they uniformly welcomed the elimination of clutter brought
   on by the reduction in redundant items. In addition, of households that
   were loyal to a single brand, size, or brand-size combination that was
   eliminated. nearly half continued purchasing within the category. Also,
   contrary to previous research on SKU reductions, the authors find that
   category sales depend on the total number of SKUs offered. The authors
   extend the previous research by showing that (1) category sales depend
   on the availability of key product and category attributes and (2) two
   particularly important attributes to consumers in an assortment are
   brand and flavor.

AB Applying attribution theory to consumer behavior issues is quite common.
   In the managerial arena, previous research suggests that salespeople's
   attribution processes affect their expectancies for success and future
   behavior. However, no published research has developed adequate measures
   that might be used to examine the full range of attributional responses
   for sales success or failure and the behaviors that are likely to follow
   such attributions. The goal of this research is to develop a complete
   set of attributional and behavioral scales for sales success and failure
   and validate such scales in a real-world context-among field sales
   representatives. Following Churchill's (1979) recommended process, the
   authors develop a complete set of attributional and behavioral intention
   scales that is applicable to a field sales force setting. The authors
   then measure 228 financial services representatives' performance
   attributions for a previous sales interaction; their intended behaviors
   for a future, similar selling situation; and their personal
   characteristics. The authors test the validities of the scales and
   examine the usefulness of applying the scales within a theoretically
   justified nomological network of relationships.

AB Category management (CM) is a recent retail management initiative that
   aims at improving a retailer's overall performance in a product category
   through more coordinated buying, merchandising, and pricing of the
   brands in the category than in the past. Despite tremendous retailer and
   manufacturer interest in the process of CM and its rapid adoption in the
   industry, much uncertainty exists about the consequences of CM for
   channel members. The present study focuses on how a shift to CM by a
   retailer affects its equilibrium prices, sales, and profitability in a
   competitive retail setting. On the basis of an analysis of a model of
   two competing national brand manufacturers that supply two competing
   common retailers, the authors find that one retailer's adoption of CM
   increases its average unit price of the category and reduces its sales
   volume and revenues. However, this retailer can still enjoy an increase
   in its gross margin profits as competing manufacturers' wholesale prices
   fall in the process. Also, the CM adopter's profits are greater than
   those of a symmetric competing retailer that follows the traditional
   brand-centered management of a product category when the interbrand
   competition is high but interstore competition is low. Applying the
   intervention analysis methodology, the authors empirically test several
   of these analytical findings, employing a unique data set that contains
   information about a supermarket chain's weekly average unit prices and
   sales of the laundry detergent category before and after this product
   category was moved to CM by the retailer. The propositions that adoption
   of CM will lead to higher retail prices and lower sales are upheld in
   this empirical study. The authors discuss the implications of these
   findings for practitioners and researchers, the limitations of the
   study, and directions for further research.

   Although researchers have suggested that logistics competencies
   complement marketing efforts, empirical evidence is lacking on what

   different meanings for separate customer segments. The authors present
   empirical support for nine related logistics service quality constructs;
   demonstrate their unidimensionality, validity, and reliability across
   four customer segments of a large logistics organization; and provide
   empirical support for a logistics service quality process. Although
   structural equation modeling offers support for the logistics service
   quality process across customer segments, the authors find that the
   relative parameter estimates differ for each segment, which suggests
   that firms ought to customize their logistics services by customer
   segments.

AB The authors develop a framework for understanding the behaviors and
   practices of service providers that build or deplete consumer trust and
   the mechanisms that convert consumer trust into value and loyalty in
   relational exchanges. The proposed framework (1) uses a multidimensional
   conceptualization for the trustworthiness construct; (2) incorporates
   two distinct facets of consumer trust, namely, frontline employees and
   management policies and practices; and (3) specifies value as a key
   mediator of the trust-loyalty relationship. The authors test the
   proposed model using data from two service contexts-retail clothing (N =
   264) and nonbusiness airline travel (N = 113). The results support a
   tripartite view of trustworthiness evaluations along operational
   competence, operational benevolence, and problem-solving orientation
   dimensions. Moreover, the authors find evidence of contingent asymmetric
   relationships between trustworthiness dimensions and consumer trust. For
   frontline employees, benevolent behaviors demonstrate a dominant
   "negativity" effect (i.e., a unit negative performance has a stronger
   effect than a unit positive performance), whereas problem-solving
   orientation has a dominant "positivity" effect (i.e., a unit positive
   performance has a stronger effect than a unit negative performance).
   Value completely mediates the effect of frontline employee trust on
   loyalty in the retailing context and partially mediates the effect of
   management policies and practices trust on loyalty in the airlines
   context. The role of frontline employees is more critical in the
   retailing context, whereas management practices and policies play the
   dominant role in the airlines context. Overall, the proposed framework
   successfully models trust and loyalty mechanisms across the two
   industries examined in the study, while remaining sensitive to essential
   contextual differences.

AB Bundling is pervasive in today's markets. However, the bundling
   literature contains inconsistencies in the use of terms and ambiguity
   about basic principles underlying the phenomenon. The literature also
   lacks an encompassing classification of the various strategies, clear
   rules to evaluate the legality of each strategy, and a unifying
   framework to indicate when each is optimal. Based on a review of the

   benefits. First, the article clearly and consistently defines bundling
   terms and identifies two key dimensions that enable a comprehensive
   classification of bundling strategies. Second, it formulates clear rules
   for evaluating the legality of each of these strategies. Third, it
   proposes a framework of 12 propositions that suggest which bundling
   strategy is optimal in various contexts. The synthesis provides managers
   with a framework with which to understand and choose bundling
   strategies. It also provides researchers with promising avenues for

AB A decision of increasing importance is how ingredient attributes that
   make up a product should be labeled or branded, if at all. The authors
   conduct a laboratory experiment to consider how ingredient branding
   affects consumer acceptance of a novel line extension (or one that has
   not been introduced before) as well as the ability of the brand to
   leverage that ingredient to introduce future category extensions. The
   authors study two particular types of novel line extensions or brand
   expansions: (1) slot-filler expansions, in which the level of one
   existing product attribute changes (e.g., a scent in Tide detergent that
   is new to the laundry detergent category) and (2) new attribute
   expansions, in which an entirely new attribute or characteristic is
   added to the product (e.g., cough relief liquid added to Life Savers
   candy). The authors examine two types of ingredient branding strategies
   by branding the target attribute ingredient for the brand expansion with
   either a new name as a self-branded ingredient (e.g., Tide with its own
   EverFresh scented bath soap) or an established, well-respected name as a
   cobranded ingredient (e.g., Tide with Irish Spring scented bath soap).
   The results indicate that with slot-filler expansions, a cobranded
   ingredient facilitates initial expansion acceptance, but a self-branded
   ingredient leads to more favorable subsequent category extension
   evaluations. With more dissimilar new attribute expansions, however, a
   cobranded ingredient leads to more favorable evaluations of both the
   initial expansion and the subsequent category extension. The authors
   offer interpretation, implications, and limitations of the findings, as
   well as directions for further research.

AB The allocation of excess cash has long been recognized in the finance
   literature as an important aspect of the basic agency conflict between
   managers and owners. In the advertising budgeting context, marketing
   scholars report that firms possessing high levels of cash tend to spend
   more on advertising than what seems necessary or desirable. Indeed, this
   positive link between excess cash and advertising expenditures
   constitutes a part of what is commonly referred to as the affordability
   method of advertising budgeting. Surprisingly, there has been little
   research that attempts to view this association as a manifestation of
   agency costs. Therefore, in this article, the authors examine whether
   agency costs, as measured by managerial ownership, moderate the
   relationship between excess cash and advertising expenditures. On the
   basis of received theory, the authors conceptualize that agency costs
   will first decrease, then increase, and then decrease again with the
   level of managerial ownership. Accordingly, the authors hypothesize and
   find that the fraction of incremental earnings reinvested in advertising
   follows the same pattern in managerial ownership. These findings support
   the notion that the use of the affordability method is driven, in part,
   by agency costs. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and
   managerial implications of the findings.

AB Using data on a large number of innovative products in the consumer
   electronics industry, the authors find that between one-third and
   one-half of the sales cases involved the following pattern: an initial
   peak, then a trough of sufficient depth and duration to exclude random
   fluctuations, and eventually sales levels that exceeded the initial
   peak. This newly identified pattern, which the authors call a "saddle,"
   is explained by the dual-market phenomenon that differentiates between
   early market adopters and main market adopters as two separate markets.
   If these two segments-the early market and the main market-adopt at
   different rates, and if this difference is pronounced, then the overall
   sales to the two markets will exhibit a temporary decline at the
   intermediate stage. The authors employ both empirical analysis and
   cellular automata, an individual-level, complex system modeling
   technique for generating and analyzing data, to investigate the
   conditions under which a saddle occurs. The model highlights the
   importance of cross-market communication in determining the existence of
   a saddle. At low levels of this parameter, more than 50% of the cases of
   new product growth involved a saddle. This percentage gradually
   decreased as the parameter increased, and at values close to the
   within-market parameters, the proportion of saddle occurrences dropped
   below 5%.

AB In today's competitive battleground, the concept of brand equity has
   proved to be an important source of strategic insights for marketers.
   However, one potentially valuable source of brand equity-the operation
   of intergenerational influences-has generally been overlooked in the
   marketing literature. This article reports the findings of two studies
   that show intergene rational impacts on brand equity to be persistent
   and powerful across an array of consumer packaged goods. However, as a
   strategic challenge, these effects seem to apply strongly for some
   brands but not for others-they are selective. In Study 1, the authors
   use parallel surveys of mother-daughter dyads to isolate and quantify
   intergenerational impacts, and the surveys reveal a differential range
   of effects at both the product category and the brand level. In Study 2,
   the authors use interpretivist methods to delve more deeply into these
   effects-the forms they take, the way they have developed, and factors
   that sustain or disrupt them. On the basis of these findings, the
   authors identify implications for managers and future research needs.
   Overall, intergenerational influences are a real marketplace phenomenon
   and a factor that merits much closer attention from marketing
   strategists who are interested in brand equity issues.

AB Most firms struggle with the challenge of managing their key customer
   accounts. There is a significant gap between the importance of this
   organizational design problem in practice and the research attention
   paid to it. Sound academic research on key account management (KAM) is
   limited and fragmented. Drawing on research on KAM and team selling, the
   authors develop an integrative conceptualization of KAM and define key
   constructs in four areas: (1) activities, (2) actors, (3) resources, and
   (4) approach formalization. Adopting a configurational perspective to
   organizational research, the authors then use numerical taxonomy to
   empirically identify eight prototypical KAM approaches on the basis of a
   cross-industry, cross-national study. The results show significant
   performance differences among the approaches. Overall, the article
   builds a bridge between marketing organization research and relationship
   marketing research.

AB Horizontal arrangements are increasingly deployed in organizational
   networks, yet research has rarely examined the effectiveness of these
   alliances. The coalition of disparate corporate cultures yields
   appreciable levels of role stress for people in boundary-spanning
   positions. Dedicated assets and communication modality are factors that
   influence the level of role ambiguity and conflict. The authors
   implicate these facets of role stress as antecedents to four forms of
   effectiveness drawn from the competing' values framework. The authors
   present alternative perspectives that examine the relationship between
   stress and performance. The received view frames role stressors as
   linear, negative antecedents to organizational outcomes. The authors
   contrast this perspective with theories that espouse triphasic,
   parabolic, and interactive influences of stressors on organizational,
   outcomes. Data gathered with 218 managers of dual-branded retail oil
   outlets indicate that the relevance of these alternative perspectives is
   mitigated by the form of effectiveness pursued by the organization. The
   results support a linear relationship between role conflict and
   bargaining efforts, yet they also offer evidence of nonlinear influences
   of role ambiguity on contributions to sales, customer satisfaction, and
   competence. The study concludes with a discussion of relevance of the
   findings to the management of horizontal alliances and to
   interorganizational theory.

AB Customers form relationships with the employees who serve them as well
   as with the vendor firms these employees represent. In many cases, a
   customer's relationship with an employee who is closest to them, a key
   contact employee, may be stronger than the customer's relationship with
   the vendor firm. If the key contact employee is no longer available to
   serve that customer, the vendor firm's relationship with the customer
   may become vulnerable. In this article, the authors present the results
   of two studies that examine what business-to-business customers value in
   their relationships with key contact employees, what customers' concerns
   are when a favored key contact employee is no longer available to serve
   them, and what vendor firms can do to alleviate these concerns and to
   retain employee knowledge even if they cannot retain the employee in
   that position. The studies are based on a discovery-oriented approach
   and integrate input from business-to-business customers, key contact
   employees, and managers from a broad cross-section of companies to
   develop testable propositions. The authors discuss managerial and
   theoretical implications and directions for further research.

AB The emergence of the Internet has pushed many established companies to
   explore this radically new distribution channel. Like all market
   discontinuities, the Internet creates opportunities as well as
   threats-it can be performance-enhancing as readily as it can be
   performance-destroying. Making use of event-study methodology, the
   authors assess the net impact of adding an Internet channel on a firm's
   stock market return, a measure of the change in expected future cash
   flows. The authors find that, on average, Internet channel investments
   are positive net-present-value investments. The authors then identify
   firm, introduction strategy, and marketplace characteristics that
   influence the direction and magnitude of the stock market reaction. The
   results indicate that powerful firms with a few direct channels are
   expected to achieve greater gains in financial performance than are less
   powerful firms with a broader direct channel offering. In terms of order
   of entry, early followers have a competitive advantage over both
   innovators and later followers, even when time of entry is controlled
   for. The authors also find that Internet channel additions that are
   supported by more publicity are perceived as having a higher performance
   potential.

   trying to be entrepreneurial and successful. To examine this unnerving
   potential, the authors investigate structural influences (both direct
   and indirect) of entrepreneurial proclivity and market orientation on

   proclivity has not only a positive and direct relationship on market
   orientation but also an indirect and positive effect on market
   orientation through the reduction of departmentalization. The results
   also suggest that entrepreneurial proclivity's performance influence is

AB Using the resource-based view of the firm, the authors hypothesize that
   differences in adoption of radical technologies among firms can be
   attributed to a sense-and-respond capability of firms with respect to
   new technologies, which is termed technological opportunism. Using
   survey data from senior managers in business-to-business firms, the
   authors study the adoption of e-business, a radical technology with the
   potential to alter business models. The authors first establish the
   distinctiveness of technological opportunism from related constructs,
   such as organizational innovativeness, and show that it offers a
   significantly better explanation of technology adoption than existing
   constructs do. In a follow-up survey of senior managers, the authors
   investigate the antecedents of technological opportunism and find that
   organizations can develop technological opportunism by taking specific
   actions such as focusing on the future, by having top management
   advocate new technologies, and by becoming more of an adhocracy culture
   and less of a hierarchy culture. The proposed technological opportunism
   construct can inform theory development on the relative emphasis on
   internal (research and development) versus external (buying, licensing)
   development of technologies and the complementarities in technology
   orientation and market orientation in the firm. The results can be used
   by managers who seek to develop the technological opportunism capability
   of their firms and by those in technology vendor firms who seek to
   develop segmentation strategies based on the technological opportunism
   capabilities of their customer firms.

AB There is a strong normative bias toward the inherent value of trust
   among both marketing researchers and practitioners. Yet there is little
   empirical evidence of a positive impact of trust on performance. Indeed,
   scholars suggest that the sources of trust may provide opportunities for
   its abuse. Following this line of thinking, the authors investigate the
   dual roles of sales controls and supervisor behaviors as antecedents of
   salespeople's belief in the benevolence of the supervisor (i.e.,
   supervisee trust). The authors then examine these antecedents as
   moderators of the relationship between supervisee trust and sales
   performance in the context of selling new products. Data on field
   salespeople from high-technology firms in China and the United States
   suggest that factors such as supervisor accessibility engender
   supervisee trust but do not necessarily enhance its impact on sales
   performance. In the Chinese sample, supervisee trust enhances sales
   performance when output control is adopted, when the supervisor has a
   higher level of achievement orientation style, and when the salesperson
   has higher role ambiguity. Furthermore, the results suggest that the
   supervisee trust-sales performance relationship is negative when
   supervisor accessibility is high. With the exception of achievement
   orientation and supervisor accessibility, these effects are negative or
   nonexistent in the U.S. sample. The authors discuss theoretical and
   practical implications of the study's findings.

AB Set within the political economy framework, marketing channels
   literature predominantly has used an efficiency-based task environment
   perspective and largely overlooked a legitimacy-based institutional
   environment approach in studying channel attitudes, behaviors,
   processes, and structures. The purpose of this article is to highlight
   the importance of the institutional environment and develop a
   comprehensive conceptual framework that incorporates the institutional
   environment into current marketing channels research. The institutional
   environment perspective relies on the primacy of (1) regulatory
   institutions (e.g., laws), (2) normative institutions (e.g.,
   professions), and (3) cognitive institutions (e.g., habitual actions) in
   influencing the legitimacy of channel members. Using institutional
   theory, the authors augment the current task environment approach by
   developing three institutional processes and their underlying mechanisms
   and elaborating on how these institutions might influence channel
   relationships, The article ends by laying out a research agenda and
   highlighting managerial implications.

AB Four studies investigate the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act's
   (NLEA's) impact on how consumers use nutrition information. Field and
   laboratory studies compare, but do not detect any changes in, consumers'
   search for nutrition information or their recall of this information in
   the pre- and post-NLEA periods. However, the search activities of a
   select group (highly motivated and less knowledgeable consumers)
   benefited more from the NLEA than did other groups. Additional results
   from the field and lab studies indicate that the NLEA changed attention
   to negative nutrition attributes (such as fat and sodium, of which less
   is better) more than it changed attention to positive attributes such as
   calcium and vitamins. Analyses of scanner databases confirm this trend
   (with the exception of calories). Focus group results also reflect these
   findings. The authors discuss implications for public policy,
   management, academic research, and consumer welfare.

AB Financial benefits from quality may be derived from revenue expansion,
   cost reduction, or both simultaneously. The literature on both market
   orientation and customer satisfaction provides considerable support for
   the effectiveness of the revenue expansion perspective, whereas the
   literature on both quality and operations provides equally impressive
   support for the effectiveness of the cost reduction perspective. There
   is, however, little evidence for the effectiveness of attempting both
   revenue expansion and cost reduction simultaneously, and some of what
   little empirical and theoretical literature is available suggests that
   emphasizing both simultaneously may not work. In a study of managers in
   firms seeking to obtain a financial return from quality improvements,
   the authors address the issue of which quality profitability emphasis
   (revenue expansion, cost reduction, or both) is most effective. The
   authors examine firm performance using managers' reports of firm
   performance and longitudinal secondary data on firm profitability and
   stock returns. Although it is clear that no company can neglect either
   revenue expansion or cost reduction, the empirical results suggest that
   firms that adopt primarily a revenue expansion emphasis perform better
   than firms that try to emphasize cost reduction and better than firms
   that try to emphasize both revenue expansion and cost reduction
   simultaneously. The results have implications with respect to how both
   theory and practice view organizational efforts to achieve financial
   returns from quality improvements.

   marketing strategy. They also develop a conceptual model that links the
   GMS to a firm's global market performance. On the basis of a survey of
   business units competing in global industries, the authors find support
   for the broad GMS perspective and the fundamental relationship between
   the GMS and firms' global market performance. The authors also discuss

AB The authors report a repeated measures field study that captures
   complaining customers' perceptions of their overall satisfaction with
   the firm, likelihood of word-of-mouth recommendations, and repurchase
   intent during a 20-month span that includes two service failures and
   recovery attempts. The findings suggest that though satisfactory
   recoveries can produce a "recovery paradox" after one failure, they do
   not trigger such paradoxical increases after two failures. Furthermore,
   "double deviations" can occur following two consecutive unsatisfactory
   recoveries or following an unsatisfactory recovery in response to a
   second failure. The findings indicate that customers reporting an
   unsatisfactory recovery followed by a satisfactory recovery reported
   significantly higher ratings at the second postrecovery period than did
   customers reporting the opposite recovery sequence. The outcome of the
   second recovery also demonstrated a significant influence on customer
   ratings (positively if the recovery was satisfactory, negatively if the
   recovery was unsatisfactory), regardless of whether the customer found
   the first recovery satisfactory or unsatisfactory. In addition, although
   the increased change in recovery expectations and failure severity
   ratings from the first failure to the second is more dramatic for
   customers who previously reported a satisfactory recovery, the increase
   in attributions of blame toward the firm is more pronounced for
   customers who previously reported an unsatisfactory recovery. Last, the
   results show that recovery efforts are attenuated when two similar
   failures occur and when two failures happen in close time proximity.

AB Reference price research suggests that consumers memorize and recall
   price information when selecting brands for frequently purchased
   products. Previous price-knowledge surveys, however, indicate that
   memory for prices is lower than expected. In this study, the authors
   show that these price-knowledge surveys provide imperfect estimates of
   price knowledge, because they focus only on recall and short-term
   memory. The authors propose, instead, to use a combination of price
   recall, price recognition, and deal recognition to measure the degree to
   which consumers use auditory verbal, visual Arabic, or analogue
   magnitude representations to memorize prices. The authors show how the
   combination of these three measures provides a much richer understanding
   of consumers' knowledge of prices. The results suggest that the price
   knowledge involved in reference prices may often not be accessible to
   recall but shows up in price recognition and deal recognition. In
   addition, the authors identify consumer and product characteristics that
   explain the variations in price knowledge. They find, for example, that
   frequent promotions increase consumers' ability to remember regular
   prices and that store switchers do not possess better price knowledge
   than other shoppers.

AB Augmenting products with services is a major way retailers have of
   gaining differentiation in today's competitive market. Despite its
   importance, this topic has received relatively little research
   attention. Unlike previous research, this study adopts a more
   comprehensive perspective on retail services by examining three
   important research gaps related to a service-oriented business strategy:
   First, the authors elaborate on the dimensions of a service-oriented
   business strategy and introduce a new measure of this strategy. Second,
   the authors examine the antecedents of a service-oriented business
   strategy. In practice, there appears to be considerable variability in
   terms of the extent to which retailers demonstrate a service
   orientation, but there is a major gap in the understanding of what
   factors influence this orientation. Third, the authors investigate the
   neglected link between a service-oriented business strategy and
   performance outcomes. To examine these three important areas, the
   authors conducted an empirical study of clothing and furniture retailers
   in both the United States and Germany. This study provides evidence for
   the proposed conceptualization of a service-oriented business strategy.
   The authors also find that the investigated antecedents account for some
   variance of a service-oriented business strategy, which in turn
   positively affects company performance in the market and thereby
   profitability. Furthermore, the authors discuss several important
   research issues as well as managerial implications and future research
   avenues.

   study conducted in a business-to-business context that sheds light on
   the nature of customers' desired value change and related contextual
   conditions. The authors discover that the phenomenon of customers'
   desired value change typically occurs in an emotional context, as
   managers try to cope with feelings of tension. The phenomenon extends
   well past the change itself into strategies customers use to motivate
   suppliers to meet their changed needs. Customers' value change provides
   a reason for customers to seek, maintain, or move away from

   economic implications of this trend and has not addressed customers'
   potential psychological responses to participation. The authors draw on
   the social psychological literature on the self-serving bias and conduct
   two studies to examine the effects of participation on customer
   satisfaction. Study I shows that consistent with the self-serving bias,
   given an identical outcome, customer satisfaction with a firm differs
   depending on whether a customer participates in production. Study 2
   shows that providing customers a choice in whether to participate
   mitigates the self-serving bias when the outcome is worse than expected.

AB Firms allocate their limited resources between two fundamental processes
   of creating value (i.e., innovating, producing, and delivering products
   to the market) and appropriating value (i.e., extracting profits in the
   marketplace). Although both value creation and value appropriation are
   required for achieving sustained competitive advantage, a firm has
   significant latitude in deciding the extent to which it emphasizes one
   over the other. What effect does strategic emphasis (i.e., emphasis on
   value creation versus value appropriation) have on firm's financial
   performance? The authors address this issue by examining the effect that
   shifts in strategic emphasis have on stock return. They find that the
   stock market reacts favorably when a firm increases its emphasis on
   value appropriation relative to value creation. This effect, however, is
   moderated by firm and industry characteristics, in particular, financial
   performance, the past level of strategic emphasis of the firm, and. the
   technological environment in which the firm operates. These results do
   not negate the importance of value creation capabilities, but rather
   highlight the importance of isolating mechanisms that enable the firm to
   appropriate some of the value it has created.

   Using protection motivation theory, the authors develop hypotheses
   regarding the message theme effects on cognitions and intentions and
   test them in an experiment involving 1667 adolescents. Three of the
   seven message themes increased adolescents' nonsmoking intentions
   compared with a control; all did so by enhancing adolescents'

AB The authors report the results of three experiments that address the
   effects of health claims and nutrition information placed on restaurant
   menus and packaged food labels. The-results indicate that when favorable
   nutrition information or health claims are presented, consumers have
   more favorable attitudes toward the product, nutrition attitudes, and
   purchase intentions, and they perceive risks of heart disease and stroke
   to be lower. The nutritional context in which a restaurant menu item is
   presented moderates the effects of both nutrition information and a
   health claim on consumer evaluations, which suggests that alternative
   (i.e., nontarget) menu items serve as a frame of reference against which
   the target menu item is evaluated.

AB Haptic information, or information attained through touch by the hands,
   is important for the evaluation of products that vary in terms of
   material properties related to texture, hardness, temperature, and
   weight. The authors develop and propose a conceptual framework to
   illustrate that salience of haptic information differs significantly
   across products, consumers, and situations. The authors use two
   experiments to assess how these factors interact to impair or enhance
   the acquisition and use of haptic information. Barriers to touch, such
   as a retail display case, can inhibit the use of haptic information and
   consequently decrease confidence in product evaluations and increase the
   frustration level of consumers who are more motivated to touch products.
   In addition, written descriptions and visual depictions of products can
   partially enhance acquisition of certain types of touch information. The
   authors synthesize the results of these studies and discuss implications
   for the effect of haptic information for Internet and other nonstore
   retailing as well as for traditional retailers.

AB The authors investigate the effects of explicit comparisons in
   differentiating innovations that offer new functionalities to the
   consumer. Although marketing communications commonly employ explicit
   comparisons in launching new product functionalities, the authors
   suggest that such comparisons are not always helpful. The authors show
   that an explicit comparison of a new functionality with an existing
   functionality is effective only when the new functionality is offered in
   a device or physical product that is atypical of the existing
   functionality. However, when the new functionality is offered in a
   product that is typical of the existing functionality, explicit
   comparisons tend to backfire because they merely facilitate-the
   assimilation of the. new functionality to the prior functionality. The
   results of three studies provide significant support for the
   predictions, and a fourth study demonstrates how the backfire effect
   might be avoided. The authors discuss implications for communication
   tactics, new product marketing, and consumer behavior theory.

AB Researchers suggest that developing long-term relationships with key
   stakeholders is an important strategy in today's intensely competitive
   business environment. Many organizations have embraced this concept,
   which is referred to as relationship marketing. Much of the research on
   relationship marketing success has examined relationships that (1) are
   primarily economic in nature, (2) involve business-to-business
   marketing, and (3) involve for profit firms. However, the authors argue
   that relationship marketing is a viable strategy in such contexts as
   those involving high levels of social exchange, business-to-consumer
   marketing, and nonprofit marketing. In these contexts, relationship
   marketing success may require different relationship characteristics
   from those identified in previous research. The authors develop "the
   identity salience model of relationship marketing success," which they
   posit is useful for explaining relationship marketing success in
   exchange relationships that (1) involve individuals and (2) are based
   primarily on social exchange. The authors further develop and test the
   model in the context of nonprofit higher education marketing. The
   results provide support for the model.

AB How does a business firm manage its relationship with the natural
   environment? What are the factors that influence the choice of such
   strategies? Does industry type matter? The authors introduce and
   operationalize the concept of corporate environmentalism in an effort to
   answer these questions. Using stakeholder theory, the authors identify
   four important antecedents to corporate environmentalism, namely, public
   concern, regulatory forces, competitive advantage, and top management
   commitment. The authors then use a political-economic framework to
   develop testable hypotheses. To test the hypotheses, the authors perform
   multigroup path analysis on data gathered from more than 240 firms. They
   find that corporate environmentalism is related to all hypothesized
   antecedents and that industry type moderates several of those
   relationships. In the high environmental impact sector, public concern
   has the greatest impact on corporate environmentalism, followed by
   regulatory forces. In the moderate environmental impact sector,
   competitive advantage has the greatest impact on corporate
   environmentalism, followed by regulatory forces. There are strong direct
   and mediating influences from top management commitment, which is the
   antecedent with the greatest impact on both industry groups. The
   influences of regulatory forces, public concern, and competitive
   advantage are all significantly mediated by top management commitment
   and moderated by industry type. The empirical findings and the ensuing
   discussion will be of interest to managers and public policy officials.

AB The authors investigate the overall and subarea influence of a
   comprehensive set of marketing and marketing-related journals at three
   points in time during a 30-year period using a citation-based measure of
   structural influence. The results show that a few journals wield a
   disproportionate amount of influence in the marketing journal network as
   a whole and that influential journals tend to derive their influence
   from many different journals. Different journals are most influential in
   different subareas of marketing; general business and managerially
   oriented journals have lost influence, whereas more specialized
   marketing journals have gained in influence overtime. The Journal of
   Marketing emerges as the most influential marketing journal in the final
   period (1996-97) and as the journal with the broadest span of influence
   across all subareas. Yet the Journal of Marketing is notably influential
   among applied marketing journals, which themselves are of lesser
   influence. The index of structural influence is significantly correlated
   with other objective and subjective measures of influence but least so
   with the impact factors reported in the Social Sciences Citation Index.
   Overall, the findings demonstrate the rapid maturation of the marketing
   discipline and the changing role of key journals in the process.

AB Are dominant firms laggards or leaders at innovation? The answers to
   this question are conflicting and controversial. In an attempt to
   resolve conflicting answers to this question, the authors argue that
   dominance is a multifaceted construct in which individual facets result
   in differing (and countervailing) propensities to innovate. To identify
   the overall effects of dominance, it is necessary to consider the
   effects of these facets taken together. The authors also study a
   hitherto ignored yet important driver of innovation, technology
   expectations, and show that managers have widely divergent expectations
   of the same new technology. Furthermore, even when their expectations
   are the same, managers of dominant firms display investment behavior at
   odds with their counterparts at nondominant firms. The authors use a
   triangulation of research methods and combine insights from lab studies
   with those from field interviews, archival data, and a survey of
   bricks-and-mortar banks' responses to Internet banking.

   industry help explain the existence of quantity surcharges. Two studies
   support the authors' contention that common pricing practices aimed at
   establishing a favorable store-price image can result in quantity
   surcharges. First, an experiment shows that consumer demand and the
   importance price setters place on establishing a low store-price image
   have an interactive effect on price-setting behavior. Second, an
   examination of retail sales volume, price, and cost data suggests that
   such price-setting reactions can result in quantity surcharges when
   certain asymmetries in demand exist across package sizes. The authors
   also discuss managerial and public policy implications along with areas

   Researchers have yet to establish the efficacy of self-prophecy in

   studies that demonstrate successful application of self-prophecy through

   The theory suggests that a supplier and a customer can improve their
   joint learning activities by facilitating information exchange,
   developing common learning arenas, and updating their behavior
   accordingly. The authors suggest that learning within a
   customer-supplier relationship cannot be mandated by either
   organization, but rather learning depends on both parties' willingness
   to cooperate in joint learning activities. Management can promote
   relationship learning by cultivating a collaborative culture,
   formulating specific objectives for joint learning activities, and
   developing relational trust. However, as relational trust develops, the
   effectiveness of learning is reduced as a result of "hidden costs" of
   trust. The authors use data from 315 dyads to test the theory
   empirically, and they find that the learning capability of a
   relationship has a strong, positive effect on performance. Their results

AB Buyers are increasingly turning to online reverse auctions in their

   affect buyer-supplier relationships? The author considers this question
   in the context of a quasi experiment involving six online reverse
   auctions conducted in the supply base of a major industrial buyer. The
   results indicate that these auctions increase both new and current
   suppliers' beliefs that buyers act opportunistically, particularly in
   open-bid auctions. Current suppliers are generally more willing than new
   suppliers to make dedicated investments toward the buyer. Paradoxically,
   in sealed-bid auctions, both current and new suppliers increase their
   willingness to make dedicated investments toward the buyer. Although
   those auctions can yield cost savings, the savings are category specific
   and are not systematically related to an open- or sealed-bid format. The
   author also discusses implications for the use of online reverse

AB In business-to-business marketing, managers are often tasked with
   developing effective global pricing strategies for customers
   characterized by different cultures and different utilities for product
   attributes. The challenges of formulating international pricing
   schedules are especially evident in global markets for service
   offerings, where intensive customer contact, extensive customization
   requirements, and reliance on extrinsic cues for service quality make
   pricing particularly problematic. The purpose of this article is to
   develop and test a model of the antecedents of business customers' price
   elasticities of demand for services in an international setting. The
   article begins with a synthesis of the services, pricing, and global
   marketing literature streams and then identifies factors that account
   for differences in business customers' price elasticities for service
   offerings across customers in Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America.
   The findings indicate that price elasticities depend on service quality,
   service type, and level of service support and that horizontal segments
   do exist, which provides support for pricing strategies transcending
   national borders. The article concludes with a discussion of the
   managerial implications of these results for effective segmentation of
   global markets for services.

   plural governance, namely the conditions that motivate firms to deploy
   plural governance and the manner in which one governance form influences
   the other when the two coexist in a joint structure. Drawing on agency
   theory and information economics, the author develops a set of research
   hypotheses and tests them empirically in the context of industrial
   purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the plural governance
   phenomenon can be understood from the perspective of solving information

AB Scholars have questioned the effectiveness of several customer
   relationship management strategies. The author investigates the
   differential effects of customer relationship perceptions and
   relationship marketing instruments on customer retention and customer
   share development over time. Customer relationship perceptions are
   considered evaluations of relationship strength and a supplier's
   offerings, and customer share development is the change in customer
   share between two periods. The results show that affective commitment
   and loyalty programs that provide economic incentives positively affect
   both customer retention and customer share development, whereas direct
   mailings influence customer share development. However, the effect of
   these variables is rather small. The results also indicate that firms
   can use the same strategies to affect both customer retention and
   customer share development.

AB How do salespeople make judgments of merit pay fairness? By what
   mechanisms do fairness judgments influence the performance and
   commitment of salespeople? Using equity and social exchange theories,
   the authors examine these questions for industrial salespeople who work
   in a Fortune 500 firm and provide four key findings. First, of the three
   dimensions of fairness judgments, they find the interactional fairness
   dimension to be relatively more important than procedural or
   distributive fairness in influencing job outcomes of salespeople.
   Second, supervisory behaviors have significant influence in shaping
   salespeople's fairness judgments, particularly judgments of distributive
   and interactional fairness. Third, the results underscore the
   contrasting mediating role of trust in supervisor and job satisfaction.
   Although trust in the supervisor is important in reducing salespeople's
   opportunistic behaviors, the authors find job satisfaction to be
   important in enhancing their loyalty to the organization. Fourth,
   salespeople's job performance is influenced directly by extrinsic
   factors such as fairness of current rewards and potential for rewards.
   In addition, the authors outline implications for theory and practice.

AB Radical innovations are engines of economic growth and the focus of much
   academic and practitioner interest, yet some fundamental questions
   remain unanswered. The authors use theoretical arguments on the risk
   associated with radical innovations, and the resources needed for them,
   to answer the following questions on the sources and financial
   consequences of radical innovation: (1) Who introduces a greater number
   of radical innovations: dominant or nondominant firms? (2) How great are
   the financial rewards to radical innovations, and how do these rewards
   vary across dominant and nondominant firms? (3) Is it only a firm's
   resources in the aggregate or also its focus and leverage of resources
   that make its innovations more financially valuable? and (4) Which are
   more valuable: innovations that incorporate a breakthrough technology or
   innovations that provide a substantial increase in customer benefits?
   The authors pool information from a disparate set of sources in the
   pharmaceutical industry to study these questions. Results indicate that
   a large majority of radical innovations come from a minority of firms.
   The financial rewards of innovation vary dramatically across firms and
   are tied closely to firms' resource base. Firms that provide higher
   per-product levels of marketing and technology support obtain much
   greater financial rewards from their radical innovations than do other
   firms. Firms that have greater depth and breadth in their product
   portfolio also gain more from their radical innovations.

AB The authors investigate how critics affect the box office performance of
   films and how the effects may be moderated by stars and budgets. The
   authors examine the process through which critics affect box office
   revenue, that is, whether they influence the decision of the film going
   public (their role as influencers), merely predict the decision (their
   role as predictors), or do both. They find that both positive and
   negative reviews are correlated with weekly box office revenue over an
   eight-week period, suggesting that critics play a dual role: They can
   influence and predict box office revenue. However, the authors find the
   impact of negative reviews (but not positive reviews) to diminish over
   time, a pattern that is more consistent with critics' role as
   influencers. The authors then compare the positive impact of good
   reviews with the negative impact of bad reviews to find that film
   reviews evidence a negativity bias; that is, negative reviews hurt
   performance more than positive reviews help performance, but only during
   the first week of a film's run. Finally, the authors examine two key
   moderators of critical reviews, stars and budgets, and find that popular
   stars and big budgets enhance box office revenue for films that receive
   more negative critical reviews than positive critical reviews but do
   little for films that receive more positive reviews than negative
   reviews. Taken together, the findings not only replicate and extend
   prior research on critical reviews and box office performance but also
   offer insight into how film studios can strategically manage the review
   process to enhance box office revenue.

AB Marketing inherited a model of exchange from economics, which had a
   dominant logic based on the exchange of "goods," which usually are
   manufactured output. The dominant logic focused on tangible resources,
   embedded value, and transactions. Over the past several decades, new
   perspectives have emerged that have a revised logic focused on
   intangible resources, the cocreation of value, and relationships. The
   authors believe that the new perspectives are converging to form a new
   dominant logic for marketing, one in which service provision rather than
   goods is fundamental to economic exchange. The authors explore this
   evolving logic and the corresponding shift in perspective for marketing
   scholars, marketing practitioners, and marketing educators.

AB Network externalities are playing an increasingly important role in the
   economy, and they have significant implications for firms' marketing
   strategies. The authors study the effects of network externalities in
   conjunction with other product and firm characteristics on the survival
   of pioneers. They apply an accelerated failure time model to data on 45
   office products and consumer durables. The authors find evidence that
   network externalities have a negative main effect on the survival
   duration of pioneers. However, for more radical products and for
   technologically intense products, increases in network externalities are
   associated with increased survival duration. The larger the pioneer, the
   more network externalities increase its survival duration, whereas
   incumbent pioneers experience a decrease in survival duration compared
   with nonincumbents. The findings of this article contribute to theory in
   marketing strategy and have important implications for firms that are
   developing market entry strategies for products with network
   externalities.

AB Both the size and the rapid growth of global exporting have focused the
   attention of marketing researchers on the factors associated with firms'
   export performance. However, knowledge of this increasingly important
   domain of marketing activity remains limited. To address this knowledge
   gap, the authors draw on the strategy and marketing literature to
   develop an integrative theory of the antecedents of export venture
   performance. The interplay among available resources and capabilities,
   competitive strategy decisions, and competitive intensity determines
   export venture positional advantages and performance outcomes in the
   theoretical model. The authors empirically assess predicted
   relationships using survey data from 287 export ventures. Results
   broadly support the theoretical model, indicating that resources and
   capabilities affect export venture competitive strategy choices and the
   positional advantages achieved in the export market, which in turn
   affect export venture performance outcomes. In contrast to
   structure-conduct-performance theory predictions, the data indicate that
   the competitive intensity of the export marketplace does not have a
   direct effect on export venture positional advantages or performance.
   However, competitive intensity moderates the relationship between export
   venture competitive strategy choices and the positional advantages
   realized.

AB The authors present a unified strategic framework that enables competing
   marketing strategy options to be traded off on the basis of projected
   financial return, which is operationalized as the change in a firm's
   customer equity relative to the incremental expenditure necessary to
   produce the change. The change in the firm's customer equity is the
   change in its current and future customers' lifetime values, summed
   across all customers in the industry. Each customer's lifetime value
   results from the frequency of category purchases, average quantity of
   purchase, and brand-switching patterns combined with the firm's
   contribution margin. The brand-switching matrix can be estimated from
   either longitudinal panel data or cross-sectional survey data, using a
   logit choice model. Firms can analyze drivers that have the greatest
   impact, compare the drivers' performance with that of competitors'
   drivers, and project return on investment from improvements in the
   drivers. To demonstrate how the approach can be implemented in a
   specific corporate setting and to show the methods used to test and
   validate the model, the authors illustrate a detailed application of the
   approach by using data from the airline industry. Their framework
   enables what-if evaluation of marketing return on investment, which can
   include such criteria as return on quality, return on advertising,
   return on loyalty programs, and even return on corporate citizenship,
   given a particular shift in customer perceptions. This enables the firm
   to focus marketing efforts on strategic initiatives that generate the
   greatest return.

   through individual service employees and their interactions with
   customers. Although prior research has established a link between
   service-worker customer orientation and performance outcomes, little
   research has addressed other potentially important outcomes of customer
   orientation. Drawing from the literature on person-situation interaction
   and fit theory, the authors develop and test a model that explains how
   service-worker customer orientation affects several important job
   responses, including perceived job fit, job satisfaction, commitment to
   the firm, and organizational citizenship behaviors. Across three field
   studies in two distinct services industries, the results indicate that
   the positive influence of customer orientation on certain job responses
   is stronger for service workers who spend more time in direct contact
   with customers than for workers who spend less time with customers. The

   that retailers earn on national brands and store brands. They
   particularly focus on the impact of store-brand share on percentage
   margin, dollar margin per unit, and total dollar margin of the retailer.
   The authors find not only that percentage retail margins on store brands
   are higher than on national brands but also that high store-brand share
   enables retailers to earn higher percentage margins on national brands.
   However, the dollar margin per unit may be smaller for store brands
   because of their lower retail price. Furthermore, heavy store-brand
   users contribute much less to the total dollar profit of the retailer
   than do light store-brand users. The authors conclude that it is
   important for retailers to retain a balance between store brands and

   simulating the model to provide guidelines for customer portfolio
   management. An important insight from the research is that a key to the
   creation of value through closer relationships lies in bringing weaker
   relationships into a portfolio in the first place. Another insight is
   that firms that position themselves toward offerings with low economies

AB Consumers purchase goods from various channels or retail formats, such
   as grocery stores, drugstores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and
   convenience stores. To identify the most appropriate channels and to
   allocate the distribution of products among channels efficiently,
   managers need a better understanding of consumer behavior with respect
   to these channels. The authors examine the moderating role of
   channel-category associations in consumer channel patronage by extending
   the literature on brand associations to the context of channels, and
   they estimate a model that links channel-category associations with
   consumer geodemographics and channel share of volume. The authors first
   identify the product categories associated with particular channels
   through a correspondence analysis of a field-intercept survey. They then
   use the channel-category associations and geodemographic factors to
   estimate their direct and interactive effects on channel share of
   volume. The channel-category associations have significant main effects
   and interaction effects with channel type and geodemographic factors on
   channel share of volume, and they account for the majority of the
   explained variance (72%) in channel share of volume. Overall, the
   findings provide several conceptual and managerial insights into
   consumer channel perceptions and patronage behavior.

   and related marketing programs (MPs) in response to changing market
   needs is key to the success of a firm. This research examines the
   mediating role of NP and MP creativity between market orientation and NP
   success. The authors investigate (1) whether market orientation
   facilitates or inhibits creativity, (2) whether creativity influences NP
   performance, and (3) how to define and measure creativity in the NP
   development and launch contexts. They use a two-stage sampling frame to
   collect 312 sets of responses from managers and NP team leaders and
   thereby address the potential for common method bias in measures of
   creativity and NP performance. The findings indicate that NP and MP
   creativity mediates the relationship between market orientation and NP
   success. The authors also show that the meaningfulness dimension, rather
   than the novelty dimension, of creativity is of greater importance in
   explaining the link between market orientation and NP success. The
   empirical results provide significant theoretical and managerial
   implications for NP strategy.

AB This study focuses on the dynamic process that governs the impact of
   market knowledge diffusion on innovation effort and its subsequent
   effect on firm performance. First, the author proposes that three
   aspects of market knowledge (knowledge level, knowledge change, and
   extent of shared knowledge about customers and competitors) influence
   innovation effort. In so doing, she explicitly models the dynamic
   process of competition, including heterogeneity in interdependence of
   innovation across competitors, firm-specific inertial tendency in
   innovation, and feedback effects reflected in satisfaction with past
   performance. Second, within a partial adjustment model of performance,
   the author studies the role of shared market knowledge and firm size in
   the translation of innovation effort into firm performance over time.
   She tests the conceptual framework with longitudinal quasi field
   experiments based on a Markstrat simulation exercise, including a main
   experiment and three validation studies. The results reveal a dynamic
   system in which some aspects of market knowledge diffusion propel
   innovation, whereas satisfaction with past performance hinders
   innovation effort. Furthermore, the results show that innovation effort,
   by itself, does not affect firm performance. In the context of the
   study, total shared market knowledge helps smaller firms actualize
   better returns from their innovation effort than larger firms.

AB Consumers sometimes encounter a combination of comparative and
   noncomparative prices in the marketplace. For example, a grocer may
   employ signage that provides favorable price comparisons with those of a
   competitor for a portion of its products, a practice that the authors
   refer to as "partially comparative pricing." The authors examine the
   effects of partially comparative pricing on consumer response and find
   that it has both desirable and undesirable effects. On the one hand,
   such pricing enhances consumers' beliefs about the relative prices of
   comparatively priced products and about the retailer's relative prices
   in general. On the other hand, such pricing also reduces consumers'
   relative price beliefs about noncomparatively priced products and their
   intentions to purchase such products. The authors further show that the
   adverse influence of partially comparative pricing stems from consumers'
   suspicions about why price comparisons exist for some, but not all,
   products. They also document how these effects depend on store
   patronage. They discuss implications of their research and provide
   suggestions for future empirical efforts.

AB When firms' customers are located in geographically dispersed areas, it
   can be difficult to manage service quality because its relative

   addressing such spatial aspects of satisfaction data can improve
   management's ability to implement programs aimed at enhancing service
   quality. Specifically, managers can identify areas of high service
   responsiveness, that is, areas in which overall satisfaction is low but
   customers are highly responsive to improvements in service quality. The
   authors estimate the spatial patterns using geographically weighted
   regression, a technique that accounts for spatial dependence in the
   variables. They apply this methodology to a large national sample of
   automobile customers served by a network of dealerships across the
   United States. The authors also investigate the extent to which factors
   related to the physical and psychological landscape explain the
   importance that people in different regions place on dealership service

   various degrees of initial asymmetry and have evolved in dramatically
   different ways over time. Their findings suggest that weaker firms can
   structure and thrive in long-term relationships with powerful partners
   because initial asymmetries are subsequently redressed through the
   development of high levels of interpersonal trust across the dyad, which

AB Although boycotts are increasingly relevant for management decision
   making, there has been little research of an individual consumer's
   motivation to boycott. Drawing on the helping behavior and boycott
   literature, the authors take a cost-benefit approach to the decision to
   boycott and present a conceptualization of motivations for boycott
   participation. The authors tested their framework during an actual
   boycott of a multinational firm that was prompted by factory closings.
   Consumers who viewed the closures as egregious were more likely to
   boycott the firm, though only a minority did so. Four factors are found
   to predict boycott participation: the desire to make a difference, the
   scope for self-enhancement, counterarguments that inhibit boycotting,
   and the cost to the boycotter of constrained consumption. Furthermore,
   self-enhancement and constrained consumption are significant moderators
   of the relationship between the perceived egregiousness of the firm's
   actions and boycott participation. The authors also explore the role of
   perceptions of others' participation and discuss implications for
   marketers, nongovernmental organizations, policymakers, and researchers.

AB Telephone interviews were conducted with more than 900 adolescents aged
   12 to 18 as part of a multimillion dollar, statewide, antitobacco

   (1) Do counter-advertising campaign attitudes directly affect
   antismoking beliefs and intent in a manner similar to those of
   conventional advertisements? and (2) Can advertising campaign attitudes
   have a stronger effect on beliefs and intent for adolescents with prior
   smoking behavior and for adolescents exposed to social influence (i.e.,
   friends, siblings, or adult smoker in the home)? The authors' findings
   show that advertising campaign attitudes, prior trial behavior, and
   social influence all directly affect antismoking beliefs and that
   advertising campaign attitudes interact with prior trial behavior to
   strengthen antismoking beliefs. The results indicate that attitudes
   related to the campaign, prior trial behavior, and social influence
   directly influence intent, and advertising campaign attitudes interact
   with social influence and prior trial behavior to attenuate adolescent
   intent to smoke. In addition, the effect of advertising campaign
   attitudes in attenuating social influence and prior trial behavior
   effects on adolescent intent to smoke persists even when the authors
   account for strongly held beliefs about smoking. The authors discuss

AB Both theory and recent research evidence suggest that a corporation's
   socially responsible behavior can positively affect consumers' attitudes
   toward the corporation. The effect occurs both directly and indirectly
   through the behavior's effect on customer-corporation identification.
   The authors report the results of four studies designed to replicate and
   extend these findings. Using a field survey design, Study 1 provides
   evidence that perceived corporate social responsibility affects not only
   customer purchase behavior through customer-corporate identification but
   also customer donations to corporate-supported nonprofit organizations.
   Using experimental designs, Studies 2 and 3 replicate and extend the
   Study 1 findings by providing additional evidence for the mediating role
   of customer-corporate identification on the relationship between
   corporate social responsibility and customer donations. However, the
   combined results of Studies 2 and 3 also show that because of a
   "perceived opportunity to do good" by supporting a company that is
   changing its ways, consumers are more likely to donate to a
   corporate-supported nonprofit when the corporation has a weaker
   historical record of socially responsible behavior. Finally, Study 4
   tests the relationship between the nonprofit domain and the domain of
   the corporation's socially responsible behavior as a boundary condition
   for this effect.

AB Comprehensiveness has long been recognized as a key feature of marketing
   strategy decision making. However, few studies have examined its
   antecedents and the conditions under which it influences performance.
   This study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of marketing
   strategy by investigating project-level antecedents and outcomes of
   marketing strategy comprehensiveness (MSC). Drawing on contingency and
   institutional theories perspectives, the authors develop and test the
   effects of output and process rewards, task conflict, and project
   members' intra- and extraindustry relationships on MSC. They find that
   whereas process reward and extraindustry relationships are positively
   related to MSC, task conflict (when combined with conflict avoidance)
   hinders its development. Furthermore, the results indicate that MSC has
   a more positive effect on performance when implementation speed is
   higher. Finally, the authors discover that technology and market
   uncertainties differentially moderate the relationship between MSC and
   performance; the former has a positive effect, and the latter has a
   negative effect. The authors also discuss the theoretical and practical
   implications of their findings.

AB For too long, marketers have not been held accountable for showing how
   marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. As time has gone by,
   this lack of accountability has undermined marketers' credibility,
   threatened the standing of the marketing function within the firm, and
   even threatened marketing's existence as a distinct capability within
   the firm. This article proposes a broad framework for assessing
   marketing productivity, cataloging what is already known, and suggesting
   areas for further research. The authors conclude that it is possible to
   show how marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. The effective
   dissemination of new methods of assessing marketing productivity to the
   business community will be a major step toward raising marketing's
   vitality in the firm and, more important, toward raising the performance
   of the firm itself. The authors also suggest many areas in which further
   research is essential to making methods of evaluating marketing
   productivity increasingly valid, reliable, and practical.

   a metric for customer selection and marketing resource allocation by
   developing a dynamic framework that enables managers to maintain or
   improve customer relationships proactively through marketing contacts
   across various channels and to maximize CLV simultaneously. The authors
   show that marketing contacts across various channels influence CLV
   nonlinearly. Customers who are selected on the basis of their lifetime
   value provide higher profits in future periods than do customers
   selected on the basis of several other customer-based metrics. The
   analyses suggest that there is potential for improved profits when
   managers design resource allocation rules that maximize CLV. Managers
   can use the authors' framework to allocate marketing resources

AB Firms exhibit or "manifest" three types of branding strategies:
   corporate branding, house of brands, or mixed branding. These strategies
   differ in their essential structure and in their potential costs and
   benefits to the firm. Prior research has failed to understand how these
   branding strategies are related to the intangible value of the firm. The
   authors investigate this relationship using five-year data for a sample
   of 113 U.S. firms. They find that corporate branding strategy is
   associated with higher values of Tobin's q, and mixed branding strategy
   is associated with lower values of Tobin's q, after controlling for the
   effects of several important and relevant factors. The relationships of
   the control variables are consistent with prior expectations. In
   addition, most of the firms would have been able to improve their
   Tobin's q had they adopted a branding strategy different from the one
   their brand portfolios revealed. The authors also discuss implications
   and future research directions.

   long-term impact of such marketing actions on financial metrics,
   including top-line, bottom-line, and stock market performance. The
   authors apply multivariate time-series models to the automobile
   industry, in which both new product introductions and promotional
   incentives are considered important performance drivers. Notably,
   whereas both marketing actions increase top-line firm performance, their
   long-term effects strongly differ for the bottom line. First, new
   product introductions increase long-term financial performance and firm
   value, but promotions do not. Second, investor reaction to new product
   introduction grows over time, indicating that useful information unfolds
   in the first two months after product launch. Third, product entry in a
   new market yields the highest top-line, bottom-line, and stock market
   benefits. Managers may use these results to justify new product efforts
   and to weigh short- and longterm consequences of promotional incentives.

AB Modern corporations must adopt and assimilate new technologies to build
   and sustain competitive advantage. The authors develop a theoretical
   framework to understand the relationships among (1) strategic responses
   to new technologies, (2) organizational resources, and (3) firm
   performance. Specifically, they theorize that a strategic response can
   be categorized according to the dimensions of magnitude, domain, and
   speed, and they conceptualize organizational resources as tangible and
   intangible. The authors operationalize this framework for the adoption
   of the Internet by traditional store-based retailers, for which they
   posit strategic responses as the speed of (1) adopting the Internet as a
   communications channel, (2) adopting the Internet as a sales channel,
   and (3) forming e-alliances. In addition, they use resource slack to
   represent organizational resources. Results from nine years (1992-2000)
   of data on 106 firms establish the influence of strategic responses on
   firm performance (i.e., market valuation of the firm, operationalized as
   Tobin's q). Specifically, the results show that both the adoption of the
   Internet as a communications channel and e-alliance formation positively
   influence firm performance. The positive effect of communications
   channel adoption on firm performance is enhanced further by the use of
   slack resources. Post hoc analysis reveals that the adoption of the
   Internet as a sales channel seems to matter only to firms that have
   preexisting catalog operations.

AB A study of the decision making and coping of functionally illiterate
   consumers reveals cognitive predilections. decision heuristics and
   trade-offs, and coping behaviors that distinguish them from literate
   consumers. English-as-a-second-language and poor, literate consumers are
   used as comparison groups. The strong predilection for concrete
   reasoning and overreliance on pictographic information of functionally
   illiterate consumers suggest that companies should reconsider how they
   highlight the added benefits of new products or the differentiating
   aspects of existing product offerings across channels such as
   advertising, in-store displays.. and positioning. Concrete reasoning
   also has strong implications for the execution and presentation of price
   promotions through coupons and in-store discounts, because many
   consumers are unable to process the information and thus avoid
   discounted products. Finally, the elaborate coping mechanisms identified
   and the loyalty that functionally illiterate consumers display toward
   companies that are sensitive to their literacy and numeracy deficiencies
   reveal a potential for loyalty programs aimed at this population that do
   not involve price discounts.

   effects of postmerger integration in marketing (extent and speed of
   marketing integration) on M&A performance, as mediated by integration
   outcomes (magnitude of cost savings and market-related performance).
   Results from a survey of 232 horizontal M&A show that market-related
   performance after the merger or acquisition has a much stronger impact
   on financial performance than does cost savings. In addition, the
   authors find that the extent of integration is beneficial in terms of
   cost savings but detrimental in terms of market-related performance.

AB Studies of the relationship between purchase intentions and purchase
   behavior have ignored the possibility that the very act of measurement
   may inflate the association between intentions and behavior, a
   phenomenon called "self-generated validity." In this research, the
   authors develop a latent model of the reactive effects of measurement
   that is applicable to intentions, attitude, or satisfaction data, and
   they show that this model can be estimated with a two-stage procedure.
   In the first stage, the authors use data from surveyed consumers to
   predict the presurvey latent purchase intentions of both surveyed and
   nonsurveyed consumers. In the second stage, they compare the strength of
   the association between the presurvey latent intentions and the
   postsurvey behavior across both groups. The authors find large and
   reliable self-generated validity effects across three diverse
   large-scale field studies. On average, the correlation between latent
   intentions and purchase behavior is 58% greater among surveyed consumers
   than it is among similar nonsurveyed consumers. One study also shows
   that the reactive effect of the measurement of purchase intentions is
   entirely mediated by self-generated validity and not by social norms,
   intention modification, or other measurement effects that are
   independent of presurvey latent intentions.

   horizontally related markets, and they can reach into the supply chain
   to take full advantage of it. The question is how this should be done.
   One possibility is for the firm to expand its scope, and another is to
   manage the linkage through contracts. On the basis of the adjustment
   cost theory of the firm, the author argues that the former solution is
   more appropriate when product development is fast-paced. This study
   tests the argument in a sample of several thousand firms and reports
   four tests. For both types of expansion, the author examines the
   incidence and the productivity of increased scope. The author uses
   several measures and finds results that are consistent with the theory.

   from the market orientation literature. First, the study provides a
   quantitative summary of the bivariate findings regarding the antecedents
   and the consequences of market orientation. Second, the authors use
   multivariate analyses of aggregate study effects to identify significant
   antecedents of market orientation and the process variables that mediate
   the relationship between market orientation and performance. In
   addition, using regression analysis, the authors find that the market
   orientation-performance relationship is stronger in samples of
   manufacturing firms, in low power-distance and uncertainty-avoidance
   cultures, and in studies that use subjective measures of performance.
   The authors also find that the market orientation-performance
   correlation is stronger for both cost-based and revenue-based
   performance measures in manufacturing firms than in service firms. On
   the basis of the findings, the authors conclude with a discussion of the
   implications for practice and further research.

AB Does market orientation impede breakthrough innovation? To date,
   researchers have presented opposing arguments with respect to this
   important issue. To address this controversy, the authors conceptualize
   and empirically test a model that links different types of strategic
   orientations and market forces, through organizational learning, to
   breakthrough innovations and firm performance. The results show that a
   market orientation facilitates innovations that use advanced technology
   and offer greater benefits to mainstream customers (i.e.,
   technology-based innovations) but inhibits innovations that target
   emerging market segments (i.e., market-based innovations). A technology
   orientation is beneficial to technology-based innovations but has no
   impact on market-based innovations, and an entrepreneurial orientation
   facilitates both types of breakthroughs. Different market forces (demand
   uncertainty, technology turbulence, and competitive intensity) exert
   significant influence on technology- and market-based innovations, and
   these two types of innovations affect firm performance differently. The
   results have significant implications for firm strategies to facilitate
   product innovations and achieve competitive advantages.

AB Electronic commerce is an increasingly popular business model with a
   wide range of tools available to firms. An application that is becoming
   more common is the use of self-service technologies (SSTs), such as
   telephone banking, automated hotel checkout, and online investment
   trading, whereby customers produce services for themselves without
   assistance from firm employees. Widespread introduction of SSTs is
   apparent across industries, yet relatively little is known about why
   customers decide to try SSTs and why some SSTs are more widely accepted
   than others. In this research, the authors explore key factors that
   influence the initial SST trial decision, specifically focusing on
   actual behavior in situations in which the consumer has a choice among
   delivery modes. The authors show that the consumer readiness variables
   of role clarity, motivation, and ability are key mediators between
   established adoption constructs (innovation characteristics and
   individual differences) and the likelihood of trial.

   customer has with a firm, it is important to examine job-related factors
   that affect customer service employee performance and customer
   evaluations. In two diverse customer settings, the authors capture
   matched responses from service employees, supervisors, and customers.
   The authors use the data to examine the potential chain of effects from
   customer service employee work-family conflict and family-work conflict,
   to job stress and job performance, to customer purchase intent (CPI).
   The results show direct (and indirect) effects of work-family conflict
   and family-work conflict on service employee customer-directed
   extra-role performance (CDERP). The results also show direct effects of
   job stress on service employee in-role performance (IRP) and CDERP and
   on CPI. Furthermore, the findings show that job stress has a more
   pronounced effect on IRP than on CDERP and that CDERP has a greater
   effect on CPI than does IRP. The authors conclude with a discussion of
   managerial and theoretical implications.

AB A brand that successfully extends from its parent category into a new
   extension category often faces a counterextension by a brand from the
   extension category back into its own parent category. However, there is
   little guidance available on how brand extension strategies should be
   adjusted to mitigate the risk to the parent brand from
   counterextensions. This research examines the differential impact of
   cobranded versus solo-branded extensions on customer evaluations of
   brand counterextensions. It demonstrates that customers evaluate a
   counterextension less favorably if the preceding extension by the focal
   brand is cobranded than if it is solo branded. The findings suggest that
   cobranding not only improves the attribute profile of a brand's own
   extension but also helps protect the brand against counterextensions.

AB Although there is considerable research examining the effects of
   influence strategies on relational outcomes, research has been silent on
   the effectiveness of influence strategies in achieving the primary
   objective: channel member compliance. The authors develop a theoretical
   model that predicts that noncoercive influence strategies (Rationality,
   Recommendations, Information Exchange, and Requests) with an argument
   structure that contains more thorough content result in relatively
   greater levels of compliance. The model further predicts that coercive
   influence strategies (Promises and Threats) result in compliance only
   when target dependence levels are high. The authors develop a new
   influence strategy, Rationality, which represents a noncoercive strategy
   with a full argument structure. In general, empirical findings support
   the theoretical model. However, in contrast to expectations, the use of
   Recommendations had a negative effect on compliance. Post hoc analysis
   revealed a significant interaction between trust and Recommendations on
   compliance, thus providing an explanation for this unexpected result.
   When trust is low, Recommendation strategies are counterproductive. The
   authors discuss implications of the findings and directions for further

   extent to which suppliers of a major retailer adopt ECR has a beneficial
   impact on their outcomes. The results demonstrate that whereas ECR
   adoption has a positive impact on supplier economic performance and
   capability development, it also generates greater perceptions of
   negative inequity on the part of the supplier. However, retailer
   capabilities and supplier trust moderate some of these main effects. The
   overall results are robust with respect to differences in supplier size

AB This article addresses how an organization's complaint management
   affects customer justice evaluations and, in turn, customer satisfaction
   and loyalty. In delineating an organization's complaint management, the
   authors draw a distinction between two fundamental approaches, the
   mechanistic approach (based on establishing guidelines) and the organic
   approach (based on creating a favorable internal environment). The
   empirical analysis is based on a dyadic data set that contains
   managerial assessments of companies' complaint management and
   complaining customers' assessments with respect to perceived justice,
   satisfaction, and loyalty. Findings indicate that though both the
   mechanistic and the organic approach significantly influence complaining
   customers' assessments, the mechanistic approach has a stronger total
   impact. Moreover, the study provides evidence of a primarily
   complementary relationship between the two approaches. Another key facet
   of the study is related to the moderating influences of the type of
   business (business-to-business versus business-to-consumer) and type of
   industry (service versus manufacturing). The results show that the
   beneficial effects of the mechanistic approach are stronger in
   business-to-consumer settings than in business-to-business ones and for
   service firms than for manufacturing firms.

AB Technological change is perhaps the most powerful engine of growth in
   markets today. To harness this source of growth, firms need answers to
   key questions about the dynamics of technological change: (1) How do new
   technologies evolve? (2) How do rival technologies compete? and (3) How
   do firms deal with technological evolution? Currently, the literature
   suggests that a new technology seems to evolve along an S-shaped path,
   which starts below that of an old technology, intersects it once, and
   ends above the old technology. This belief is based on scattered
   empirical evidence and some circular definitions. Using new definitions
   and data on 14 technologies from four markets, the authors examine the
   shape and competitive dynamics of technological evolution. The results
   contradict the prediction of a single S-curve. Instead, technological
   evolution seems to follow a step function, with sharp improvements in
   performance following long periods of no improvement. Moreover, paths of
   rival technologies may cross more than once or not at all.

AB In this research, the authors propose that the relationship between
   satisfaction and repurchase behavior is moderated by customer,
   relational, and marketplace characteristics. They further hypothesize
   that the moderating effects emerge if repurchase is measured as
   objective behavior but not if it is measured as repurchase intentions.
   To test for systematic differences in effects, the authors estimate
   identical models using both longitudinal repurchase measures and survey
   measures as the dependent variable. The results suggest that the
   relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase behavior is
   contingent on the moderating effects of convenience, competitive
   intensity, customer involvement, and household income. As the authors
   predicted, the results are significantly different for self-reported
   repurchase intentions and objective repurchase behavior. The conceptual
   framework and empirical findings reinforce the importance of moderating
   influences and offer new insights that enhance the understanding of what
   drives repurchase behavior.

AB Many firms rely on external organizations to acquire knowledge that is
   useful for developing creative new products and reducing the time needed
   to bring these products to market. Cluster theory suggests that this
   knowledge is often obtained from organizations located in close
   geographic proximity. Specifically, proximity is assumed to foster
   heightened face-to-face communication, strengthened relational ties,
   increased knowledge acquisition, and enhanced new product outcomes. The
   authors identify the limitations of these assumptions and offer an
   enriched model of the influence of geographic proximity on new product
   development, which they test using both a cross-sectional survey of 155
   firms in the U.S. optics industry and a longitudinal follow-up survey of
   73 of these firms. They find that firms located in close proximity
   engage in increased face-to-face communication, but this communication
   has little effect on the acquisition of the types of knowledge that lead
   to enhanced new product outcomes. In contrast, they find that e-mail
   communication leads to both enhanced new product creativity and
   development speed. In addition, they find that relational ties moderate
   rather than mediate the path connecting geographic proximity and new
   product outcomes. These findings imply that the new product development
   outcomes typically ascribed to close geographic proximity may actually
   be attributed to strong relational ties.

AB Managers face an important strategic dilemma in product innovation: how
   to exploit existing product innovation competencies (competence
   exploitation) while avoiding their dysfunctional rigidity effects by
   renewing and replacing them with entirely new competencies (competence
   exploration). Although the resolution of what is termed the
   "capability-rigidity paradox" is considered a fundamental managerial
   task in enhancing product innovation outcomes and the firm's competitive
   advantage, it has received little research attention. The author argues
   and finds support that market orientation provides a key to this
   paradox. Specifically, customer and competitor orientations ensure
   simultaneous investments in exploiting existing product innovation
   competencies and exploring new ones. The author also finds that the
   effects of these orientations on competence exploitation and exploration
   are differentially moderated by interfunctional coordination and
   perceived market opportunity. Regarding outcomes, competence
   exploitation and exploration have opposing relationships with
   incremental and radical innovation performance. However, the
   relationship between competence exploration and radical innovation
   performance is positively moderated by interfunctional coordination.
   Overall, the results of this study suggest that market orientation can
   prevent a firm from becoming operationally efficient but strategically
   inefficient by simultaneously engendering competence exploitation and
   exploration, which are differentially related to incremental and radical
   product innovation outcomes.

AB A substantial body of research evidence has now accumulated in the

   antecedents of reference price and has assessed their effects through
   experimentation. Others have calibrated a variety of reference price
   models on panel data and reported the effects on brand choice and other
   purchase decisions. In this article, the authors review the published
   literature on reference price in both the behavioral and modeling
   streams. They offer an integrative framework to review prior research on
   (1) the formation of reference price, (2) retrieval and use of reference
   price, and (3) influences of reference price on various purchase
   decisions and evaluations. In doing so, the authors examine the
   influences of consumers' prior purchase history and contextual
   moderators, such as specific purchase occasions, promotional environment
   of the store, and product category characteristics. They summarize the
   key findings, identify the unresolved issues, and offer an agenda for
   further research, which includes a set of testable propositions. They
   also identify the methodological challenges that face reference price
   research. In the concluding section, the authors discuss the managerial
   implications of reference price research.

AB Firms face two strategic decisions when engaging in a new purchase
   transaction: the decision whether to draft a detailed contract and the
   decision whether to select a partner with which they share a close tie.
   The authors study how organizational culture affects these decisions and
   the effectiveness of these decisions in curtailing the partner's
   opportunistic behavior. The results suggest that organizational culture
   exerts an important but different influence on both decisions. Selecting
   a close partner shows a marked ability to hedge against partner
   opportunism, but beyond a certain point, it encourages the opportunism
   it is designed to discourage. Contracting becomes effective only when a
   nonclose partner is selected and when the focal relationship is embedded
   in a network of close mutual contacts.

AB Marketers often use verbal claims to highlight brand benefits in
   marketing communication campaigns. However, spokescharacters may also be
   incorporated into campaigns and are often featured both in
   advertisements and on product packages. The authors use three studies to
   examine various integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategic
   combinations, including the effects related to the use of
   spokescharacters versus verbal attributes; advertisement-package
   coordination; character relevancy; and the presence of new, favorable
   brand information that may compete for cognitive resources on packages.
   Based on conceptual rationales drawn from encoding specificity, network
   associations, and the elaboration likelihood model, the findings offer
   empirical evidence that pertains to the potential benefits of including
   spokescharacters in IMC campaigns. Specifically, the use of
   spokescharacters results in more favorable brand attitudes, even when
   brand attribute recall is affected adversely by deviations from the
   primary message conveyed in the IMC campaigns. The authors offer some
   implications of these and other findings for marketers attempting to
   affect consumer evaluations favorably with spokescharacters in IMC
   campaigns.

AB The goal of this preface is to describe how the special section on
   customer relationship management (CRM) was developed. In May 2003,
   Richard Staelin, Executive Director of the Teradata Center for Customer
   Relationship Management at Duke University, proposed that Journal of
   Marketing (JM) publish a special section. The proposal included
   activities that were designed to promote interactions among marketing
   academics and practitioners; the goal was to stimulate dialogue and new
   research on CRM. I found the proposal attractive because CRM is a
   broad-based topic that interests many marketers. After extensive
   discussion, the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Teradata
   Center formally agreed to cosponsor the special section. Subsequently,
   there was a conference on Relationship Marketing and Customer
   Relationship Management (cochaired by Michael Ehret, Wesley Johnston,
   Michael Kleinaltenkamp, and Lou Pelton) that took place at Freie
   Universitat Berlin in the summer of 2003;1 a conference on Customer
   Management (cosponsored by the Marketing Science Institute and the
   Teradata Center) that was held at Duke University in March 2004; and two
   special sessions on CRM that were featured at the AMA Winter Educators'
   Conference held in San Antonio, Tex., in February 2005. The conferences
   provided many opportunities for dialogue, and the response from
   marketers who attended these events was enthusiastic. I also invited
   Richard Staelin and William Boulding (Executive Codirector of the
   Teradata Center) to work with me as consulting editors for the special
   section, and they agreed. A call for papers requested that authors
   submit their manuscripts to JM by May 2004. The consulting editors and I
   evaluated every submission with the assistance of an expert panel that
   included Leonard Berry, John Deighton, Michael Ehret, Christian
   Gronroos, Sunil Gupta, Wayne Hoyer, Wagner Kamakura, Wesley Johnston,
   Donald R. Lehmann, Charlotte Mason, Carl Mela, Scott Neslin, Roland
   Rust, Michel Wedel, and Valarie Zeithaml. All submissions underwent JM's
   standard double-blind review process, and members of JM's editorial
   review board served as reviewers. I would like to express my
   appreciation to everyone who participated in the development of the
   special section. The culmination of our work together is a set of nine
   articles and two essays that advance the science and practice of CRM. I
   hope that these articles stimulate new intellectual discoveries.

   they identify three alternative perspectives of CRM. The authors
   emphasize the need for a cross-functional, process-oriented approach
   that positions CRM at a strategic level. They identify five key
   cross-functional CRM processes: a strategy development process, a value
   creation process, a multichannel integration process, an information
   management process, and a performance assessment process. They develop a
   new conceptual framework based on these processes and explore the role
   and function of each element in the framework. The synthesis of the
   diverse concepts within the literature on CRM and relationship marketing
   into a single, process-based framework should provide deeper insight
   into achieving success with CRM strategy and implementation.

AB Academic studies offer a generally positive portrait of the effect of
   customer relationship management (CRM) on firm performance, but
   practitioners question its value. The authors argue that a firm's
   strategic commitments may be an overlooked organizational factor that
   influences the rewards for a firm's investments in CRM. Using the
   context of online retailing, the authors consider the effects of two key
   strategic commitments of online retailers on the performance effect of
   CRM: their bricks-and-mortar experience and their online entry timing.
   They test the proposed model with a multimethod approach that uses
   manager ratings of firm CRM and strategic commitments and third-party
   customers' ratings of satisfaction from 106 online retailers. The
   findings indicate that firms with moderate bricks-and-mortar experience
   are better able to leverage CRM for superior customer satisfaction
   outcomes than firms with either low or high bricks-and-mortar
   experience. Likewise, firms with moderate online experience are better
   able to leverage CRM into superior customer satisfaction outcomes than
   firms with either low or high online experience. These findings help
   resolve disparate results about the value of CRM, and they establish the
   importance of examining CRM within the strategic context of the firm.

   approved are unlikely to respond to a given marketing offer. Using data
   from a firm's customer relationship management system, the authors show
   how to target prospects who are likely to respond and be approved. This
   approach increases the number of customers who are approved and reduces
   the number of applicants who may defect after being turned down. This
   method can be extended to new customer acquisition and more effective

AB Do investments in customer satisfaction lead to excess returns? If so,
   are these returns associated with higher stock market risk? The
   empirical evidence presented in this article suggests that the answer to
   the first question is yes, but equally remarkable, the answer to the
   second question is no, suggesting that satisfied customers are economic
   assets with high returns/low risk. Although these results demonstrate
   stock market imperfections with respect to the time it takes for share
   prices to adjust, they are consistent with previous studies in marketing
   in that a firm's satisfied customers are likely to improve both the
   level and the stability of net cash flows. The implication, implausible
   as it may seem in other contexts, is high return/low risk. Specifically,
   the authors find that customer satisfaction, as measured by the American
   Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), is significantly related to market
   value of equity. Yet news about ACSI results does not move share prices.
   This apparent inconsistency is the catalyst for examining whether excess
   stock returns might be generated as a result. The authors present two
   stock portfolios: The first is a paper portfolio that is back tested,
   and the second is an actual case. At low systematic risk, both
   outperform the market by considerable margins. In other words, it is
   possible to beat the market consistently by investing in firms that do
   well on the ACSI.

AB Does the first entrant in a new market have a difficult time surviving
   or do first-mover advantages provide protection from outright failure?
   This empirical study of 264 new industrial product-markets yields
   insights into this controversial research topic. The key data analysis
   insights arise through a comparison of survival risks in markets that
   were started with a really new product and in those that were started
   with an incremental innovation. When a pioneer starts a new market with
   a really new product, it can be a major challenge just to survive. In
   contrast, in markets started by an incremental innovation, market
   pioneer survival risks are much lower. Notably, early followers have the
   same survival risk across both types of markets. Overall, these results
   indicate that in markets started by a really new product, the first to
   market is often the first to fail. In contrast, in markets started by an
   incremental innovation, it appears that first-mover advantages protect
   the pioneer from outright failure.

AB Emotional branding is widely heralded as a key to marketing success.
   However, little attention has been given to the risks posed by this
   strategy. This article argues that emotional-branding strategies are
   conducive to the emergence of a doppelganger brand image, which is
   defined as a family of disparaging images and meanings about a brand
   that circulate throughout popular culture. This article's thesis is that
   a doppelganger brand image can undermine the perceived authenticity of
   an emotional-branding story and, thus, the identity value that the brand
   provides to consumers. The authors discuss how the tenets of emotional
   branding paradoxically encourage the formation and propagation of
   doppelganger brand imagery. This article develops the counterintuitive
   proposition that rather than merely being a threat to be managed, a
   doppelganger brand image can actually benefit a brand by providing early
   warning signs that an emotional-branding story is beginning to lose its
   cultural resonance. This article demonstrates these ideas through an
   analysis of the doppelganger brand image that is beginning to haunt a
   paragon of emotional branding-Starbucks. The authors conclude with a
   discussion of how marketing managers can proactively use the insights
   gained by analyzing a doppelganger brand image.

   orientation, high arousal decreases pleasantness. In addition, high

AB Many business customers today consolidate their supply bases and
   implement preferred supplier programs. Consequently, vendors
   increasingly face the alternative of either gaining a key supplier
   status with their customers or being pushed into the role of a backup
   supplier. As product and price become less important differentiators,
   suppliers of routinely purchased products search for new ways to
   differentiate themselves in a buyer-seller relationship. This research
   investigates avenues for differentiation through value creation in
   business-to-business relationships. The results suggest that
   relationship benefits display a stronger potential for differentiation
   in key supplier relationships than cost considerations. The authors
   identify service support and personal interaction as core
   differentiators, followed by a supplier's know-how and its ability to
   improve a customer's time to market. Product quality and delivery
   performance, along with acquisition costs and operation costs, display a
   moderate potential to help a firm gain and maintain key supplier status.
   Finally, price shows the weakest potential for differentiation.

AB The objective of this article is to clarify ambiguities in the
   literature regarding the relationships among three key constructs of
   work relationships: effort, job performance, and job satisfaction. The
   relationship between job performance and job satisfaction is of central
   interest to research in organizational psychology. However, empirical
   research in that area finds that the link between these constructs is
   weak at best. A negative effect of effort on job satisfaction is
   consistent with agency theory, but there is limited empirical evidence
   to support this assumption. Moreover, some studies have found a positive
   effect of effort on job satisfaction. Using a model that incorporates
   the main constructs from agency theory and organizational psychology,
   the current study finds a negative, direct effect of effort and a
   positive, direct effect of job performance on job satisfaction. The
   authors show that conflicting findings in the literature are the result
   of inconsistency in both the measurement and the definition of
   constructs across studies that do not fully account for all the
   relationships between constructs. The current findings emphasize the
   need to distinguish clearly between factors that represent employees'
   inputs in a work relationship (i.e., effort) and those that represent
   their outputs (i.e., job performance). The article also demonstrates the
   importance of properly accounting or controlling for all key variables
   to eliminate biases that can arise in empirical research on work
   relationships.

AB In many product categories, technological evolution results in the
   emergence of a single product design that achieves market dominance. In
   this article, the authors examine two questions: Will a dominant design
   emerge in a new product category? and If it does, how long will it be
   before a dominant design emerges? Thus, the authors simultaneously model
   the probability of emergence of a dominant design and the time of that
   emergence, conditional on its emergence. The model incorporates the
   effects of several product-market characteristics on the probability and
   time of dominant design emergence, including appropriability of the
   rents associated with the product, network effects, size of the
   product's value net, the standards-setting process, radicalness of
   innovation, and research-and-development intensity. The authors use data
   for 63 office products and consumer durables to estimate a
   split-population hazard model for the probability and time of emergence
   of the dominant design. They find that a dominant design is more likely
   to emerge with weak appropriability, weak network effects, low product
   radicalness, and high research-and-development intensity. Dominant
   designs that emerge are likely to emerge sooner in product categories in
   which there is weak appropriability, there are a large number of firms
   in the value net, the standards are set by a de facto process, and there
   is low product radicalness The proposed model can be used to predict
   both the probability and the time of the emergence of a dominant design
   in a new product category.

AB Potential for trademark dilution occurs when a new brand introduces
   itself with an identical or substantially similar mark to that of an
   existing brand. Currently, there is neither a clear standard for legal
   proof of dilution nor widely accepted measures for managerial use. Using
   a shared-brand-network model, the authors use three different but
   conceptually related measurement methodologies (response latency, aided
   recall, and simulated choice) across five experiments to examine
   "blurring" dilution effects. The results suggest that when junior brands
   operate in similar categories and position on similar attributes, there
   is no immediate threat of blurring dilution. However, if the junior
   brand chooses to position on dissimilar attributes in a similar
   category, dilution of attribute associations is likely. When the junior
   brand operates in dissimilar categories, there is a threat of blurring
   dilution for both category and attribute associations. The final two
   studies demonstrate that dilution of junior brands (i.e., operating in
   dissimilar categories positioned on dissimilar attributes) can suppress
   consideration and choice probabilities for the senior brand and that
   this effect may extend over a period of time.

AB In this research, the authors examine the phenomenon of escalation bias
   in the context of managing new product introductions. In particular,
   they identify three general paths-Decision Involvement Inertia, Decision
   Involvement Distortion, and Belief Inertia Distortion-that can lead
   managers to escalate their commitments. The authors test the relative
   strength of these paths in driving observed escalation behavior. The
   results show that involvement with the initial decision, a key construct
   in numerous explanations for escalation behavior (e.g., agency theory,
   self-justification), is not a necessary condition to induce commitment
   to a losing course of action (i.e., escalation bias). Rather, the
   authors find that the driving force behind escalation behavior is
   improper use of initial positive beliefs in the face of negative new
   information. This insight has implications for the groundwork necessary
   for organizations to design systems, policies, and procedures to help
   them avoid the trap of escalation bias that is often associated with
   major strategic decisions.

AB The drivers of customer loyalty intentions are dynamic. What remains
   unclear is how these intentions evolve through the introduction and
   growth phases of a life cycle. Using a longitudinal study of cellular
   phone customers, the authors demonstrate that loyalty intentions are a
   function of perceived value early in the life cycle. Over time, more
   affective attitudes toward the brand and the relationship with the
   company come to mediate the effects of value on intentions. The results
   suggest that from the introduction to the growth stage of a life cycle,
   managers must adapt from improving value per se to measuring and
   managing relationships and brands directly.

AB In recent years, several authors have developed models that focus on the
   allocation of scarce marketing resources based on customer lifetime
   value (CLV). These approaches use CLV to develop a rank order of
   customers and recommend devoting more resources to customers with higher
   ranks. However, it has been discussed in the literature that a simple
   net present value analysis may not reflect the value of the flexibility
   to make such decisions. Therefore, some authors recommend the use of a
   real-options analysis in certain situations. Building on this stream of
   research and using the case of the option to abandon unprofitable
   customers, this article proposes an approach that combines real-options
   analysis and CLV; this approach explicitly values the seller's
   flexibility to abandon unprofitable customers. Using a combination of
   examples, empirical analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, the authors
   provide evidence that the divergence between CLV that includes and CLV
   that excludes option value can be substantial and may not be the same
   for all customers. Therefore, the authors conclude that a distribution
   of customers based on CLV can change when option value is included.
   Thus, using CLV as a basis for marketing decisions but not including the
   value of the option to make such decisions a priori when calculating CLV
   can lead to an overall biased result.

   a dynamic analysis of the simultaneous influence of cognition and affect
   in the satisfaction formation process. The results of an experimental
   study based on a real consumption experience indicate that the impact of
   cognition on the satisfaction evaluation increases and the influence of

   inconsistent performance experiences. Finally, the study shows that the

AB This research examines when and how ambient scents (i.e., scents that
   are present in the environment and do not emanate from a specific
   product) affect product evaluations. Consistent with theory in
   environmental psychology, the author predicts that such ambient scents
   can elicit emotional responses that can influence subsequent judgments,
   but only when specific conditions are met. Three factors are
   hypothesized to moderate the effects of pleasant ambient scents on
   evaluations: (1) the congruence of the scent with the product, (2) the
   salience of the scent, and (3) consumers' motivation to correct for
   extraneous influences. The findings of three experiments suggest that as
   long as ambient scents are congruent with the product, they continue to
   affect consumers' evaluations, even when their influence becomes salient
   or when consumers are sufficiently motivated to correct for extraneous
   influences. In addition, as long as the scent is not completely
   incongruent with the product, noncongruent scents are corrected for only
   when their influence becomes salient or when consumers are sufficiently
   motivated. These findings indicate that the impact of pleasant ambient
   scents on product evaluations may be stronger than that of other
   affective environmental cues.

AB Innovation adoption is rarely a short process for consumers;
   accordingly, recent research has explored adoption as a dynamic process
   that is characterized by changing patterns, or diffusion, of consumer
   use of the innovation. This research suggests that adoption is rarely a
   neutral process and that consumers can experience strong emotions in the
   initial use of innovations. However, given such emotions, two opposing
   arguments can be made as to whether the inclusion of emotional responses
   increases the predictive power of traditional models of diffusion. On
   the one hand, experienced emotion may simply be a function of gained
   benefits and, as such, may already be captured in extant models through
   cognitive assessments of net benefits. On the other hand, and as data
   from two empirical and longitudinal studies demonstrate, the learning
   process is potentially emotion generating (independent of net benefits),
   and this emotion colors product evaluations. The emotional influence is
   sizable and, importantly, not a straightforward case of "easier is
   better." In this work, the authors present the E-3 (expectation ->
   emotion -> evaluation) model, which describes how managers can better
   predict and influence the successful diffusion of complex technological
   products.

   influence of the extent of service employees' display of positive
   emotions and the authenticity of their emotional labor display on
   customers' emotional states and, subsequently, on customers' assessments
   of the service interaction and their relationship with the service
   provider. To test the study hypotheses, 223 consumers participated in a
   simulated service encounter in which actors played the roles of service
   employees. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, the employees varied both the
   extent of their smiling behavior and their emotional labor display by
   engaging in surface or deep acting. The results show that the
   authenticity of employees' emotional labor display directly affects
   customers' emotional states. However, contrary to expectations, the
   extent of employee smiling does not influence customer emotions,
   providing no support for the existence of primitive emotional contagion
   in service interactions. Furthermore, employee emotions exert an
   influence on customer outcomes that are of interest to marketers.

   power for both aggregate and weekly box office revenue, especially in

AB This article develops a conceptual framework of roles in marketing
   relationships. Drawing on emerging theory from economic sociology and
   March's (1994) notion of decision "logics" the authors discuss two
   prototypical relationship roles, namely (1) a "friend," who uses a
   "logic of appropriateness" and follows established rules, and (2) a
   "businessperson:' whose decisions are guided by utility-maximizing
   considerations under a "logic of consequences" Next, they use extant
   theories of interfirm governance to suggest that firms' relationship
   strategies can be used both to create different relationship roles in
   the first place and to activate them over time. The authors posit that
   activation can have several different outcomes, including reinforcement
   of an existing dominant role or actual switching to a new one.
   Theoretically, the conceptual framework allows for integration of
   different perspectives on interfirm relationships, some of which have
   provided seemingly inconsistent accounts of firm behavior. From a
   managerial perspective, the framework identifies specific matches
   between particular relationship roles on the one hand and firms'
   governance strategies on the other hand. In general, the framework
   suggests that an in-depth understanding of roles is a prerequisite for
   the deployment of relationship management initiatives toward resellers,
   customers, and suppliers.

AB This article explores recent advances in self-determination research to
   address why consumers develop strong attachments to "human brands," a
   term that refers to any well-known persona who is the subject of
   marketing communications efforts. Study 1 uses a survey that is analyzed
   with structural equation modeling. Study 2 is qualitative and offers
   corroborating evidence for the proposed theoretical model. Study 3
   extends the model with a more naturalistic sample and tests several
   alternative hypotheses using hierarchical regression. The results
   suggest that when a human brand enhances a person's feelings of autonomy
   and relatedness and does not suppress feelings of competence, the person
   is likely to become more strongly attached to it. This article documents
   that strong attachments are predictive of satisfied, trusting, and
   committed relationships and proposes that attachment strength may be a
   parsimonious proxy for consumer-brand relationship strength. The results
   imply that benefits would accrue to organizations such as entertainment
   firms and political parties that establish direct and routine
   interaction between human brands and consumers, that human brands to
   which consumers are attached offer significant potential as endorsers,
   and that organizations should address how to make the human brands they
   manage more authentic.

AB Dual distribution systems in which firms use vertical integration and
   market governance simultaneously are widely used across diverse
   marketing contexts (e.g., restaurants, retailing, industrial selling). A
   prominent example of dual distribution includes business format
   franchising, in which firms (i.e., the franchisors) license the
   operation of some of their units to franchisees while owning and
   operating some units themselves. Despite the widespread prevalence of
   dual distribution, there are few insights into its performance
   implications. In this article, the author examines the relationship
   between a firm's dual distribution strategy and its intangible value.
   Franchising in restaurant chains serves as the empirical context for the
   study. It is proposed that a firm's dual distribution strategy affects
   its intangible value both independently and jointly with a set of firm
   characteristics. The author considers the firm's age, scope of vertical
   integration, advertising, financial leverage, and financial liquidity as
   firm characteristics that influence the relationship between dual
   distribution strategy and intangible value. The author measures the
   firm's dual distribution strategy by the proportion of its franchised
   units to its total units and intangible value by its Tobin's q. The
   author estimates the proposed model using panel data on 55 publicly
   listed U.S. restaurant chains for the period 1992-2002. Unobserved firm
   heterogeneity is accommodated using latent class regression analysis.
   The results support a four-segment model. Dual distribution increases
   intangible value for some firms but decreases intangible value for
   others, both independently and in conjunction with other firm
   characteristics.

   satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between CSR and firm
   market value (i.e., Tobin's q and stock return), (2) corporate abilities
   (innovativeness capability and product quality) moderate the financial
   returns to CSR, and (3) these moderated relationships are mediated by
   customer satisfaction. Based on a large-scale secondary data set, the
   results show support for this framework. Notably, the authors find that
   in firms with low innovativeness capability, CSR actually reduces
   customer satisfaction levels and, through the lowered satisfaction,
   harms market value. The uncovered mediated and asymmetrically moderated

   the role of intraorganizational power and organizational learning in

AB Prior research has assumed that touch has a persuasive effect only it it
   provides attribute or structural information about a product. Under this
   view, the role of touch as a persuasive tool is limited. The main
   purpose of this research is to investigate the persuasive influence of
   touch as an affective tool in the absence of useful product-related
   information. The authors find that for people who are motivated to touch
   because it is fun or interesting, a communication that incorporates
   touch leads to increased affective response and increased persuasion,
   particularly when the touch provides neutral or positive sensory
   feedback. People who are not motivated to touch for fun will also be
   persuaded by a communication that incorporates touch when they are able
   to make sense of how the touch is related to the message. The authors
   explore the effectiveness of different types of touch in generating an
   affective response, and they replicate the effects on attitudes and
   behavior in a real-world setting. This research suggests that the
   marketing implications of touch are more substantial than previously
   believed. The authors present research implications for direct

AB Practitioners and scholars have questioned marketing communication's
   credibility because it has not been linked to firm shareholder value.
   Using secondary longitudinal data, the authors show that the impact of
   marketing communication productivity (MCP) on shareholder value is
   positive and nonlinear. In particular, the influence of MCP on the
   forward-looking performances of Tobin's q and stock return is
   curvilinear with an inverted U shape. The authors also investigate the
   moderating role of research-and-development investment and competitive
   intensity. The findings have implications for marketing managers
   regarding how to model and benchmark MCP and the dangers of blindly
   improving the productivity of advertising and sales promotion
   expenditures.

AB In many industries, firms introduce successive generations of new and
   enhanced product models to remain competitive. Product enhancements
   target first-time purchasers and consumers who already own an existing
   product and are considering upgrading to a new and enhanced product.
   Upgrade decisions differ from new purchase decisions because they are
   hindered by the psychological costs associated with the purchase price
   spent on the existing product. This research examines how the enhanced
   product can be positioned relative to the existing product to mitigate
   the psychological costs and facilitate upgrade purchases. A series of
   studies demonstrate that consumers with existing products are more
   likely to upgrade when the enhanced product is generally dissimilar to
   the existing product. Upgraders; have stronger preferences than
   first-time purchasers for enhanced products with new features rather
   than for improvements on existing features, and they prefer enhancements
   that focus on a few key features rather than a general enhancement of
   all features.

AB The adaptive selling literature identifies effective salespeople as
   those who match their influence tactics to suit the characteristics of
   buyers. However, prior research is largely silent on the specific
   influence tactics that salespeople use and the effectiveness of these
   tactics across different types of buyers. The authors propose a
   theoretical model that uses Kelman's (1961) underlying influence
   processes of internalization, compliance, and identification to identify
   the seller influence tactics that salespeople use and to assess which of
   these tactics will resonate with three types of buyers: task-oriented
   buyers, interaction-oriented buyers, and self-oriented buyers. The
   authors test their model with data from 193 bidirectionally matched
   buyer-seller dyads. The results strongly support the theoretical model
   and suggest that buyers are more complex than originally presumed.
   However, salespeople seem to recognize this complexity and use the
   combination of influence tactics prescribed by theory for persuading
   these types of buyers.

AB The authors develop a model of how consumers estimate the level of
   product inventory in their households. Two laboratory experiments and
   two field studies involving 29 product categories show that (1)
   consumers anchor their estimates on their average inventory and fail to
   adjust sufficiently; (2) adjustments follow an inelastic psychophysical
   power function, leading to overestimations of low levels of inventory
   and underestimations of high levels; and (3) adjustments are more
   elastic and, thus, more accurate when inventory is salient. Contrary to
   the assumptions of practitioners and academic modelers, these inventory
   estimates, not actual inventory levels, drive subsequent purchase
   incidence. Simulation results further show that biased estimates
   increase overstocking and spoilage among stockout-averse consumers but
   increase stockouts and unmet demand among overstocking-averse consumers.
   By predicting the magnitude, not just the direction, of estimation
   biases, the model and the results offer new insights into accelerating
   the consumption of healthy foods and improving the targeting of
   stockpiling-inducing sales promotions.

AB Relationship marketing (RM) has emerged as one of the dominant mantras
   in business strategy circles, though RM investigations often yield mixed
   results. To help managers and researchers improve the effectiveness of
   their efforts, the authors synthesize RM empirical research in a
   meta-analytic framework. Although the fundamental premise that RM
   positively affects performance is well supported, many of the authors'
   findings have significant implications for research and practice.
   Relationship investment has a large, direct effect on seller objective
   performance, which implies that additional meditated pathways may
   explain the impact of RM on performance. Objective performance is
   influenced most by relationship quality (a composite measure of
   relationship strength) and least by commitment. The results also suggest
   that RM is more effective when relationships are more critical to
   customers (e.g., service offerings, channel exchanges, business markets)
   and when relationships are built with an individual person rather than a
   selling firm (which partially explains the mixed effects between RM and
   performance reported in previous studies).

AB The corporate social responsibility literature has focused on creating
   broad associations, such as simply being "socially responsible," and on
   the simple transfer of positive affect from sponsored causes to
   sponsoring firms. Both views fail to recognize the power of social
   initiatives as a means for differentiating among socially responsible
   firms and, in particular, for reinforcing the brand's positioning. The
   authors adopt a more traditional branding perspective and show that the
   fit between a firm's specific associations and a sponsored cause can
   reinforce or blur the firm's positioning, influence liking for the
   sponsorship, and bolster or undermine the firm's equity. They also show
   that communications decisions can mitigate the negative effects of low
   fit. Finally, they show that sponsorship effects can persist for as long
   as a year despite day-to-day exposure to other brand communications.

   pertaining to the assessment of the healthiness of food items is

   is its inferred taste, (2) the more it is enjoyed during actual

   obtain these effects both among consumers who report that they believe

AB The current understanding of reference pricing requires broadening to
   reflect contemporary advertising practices and shopping behavior. A
   content analysis of 13,594 newspaper retail advertisements reveals that
   it is uncommon for reference pricing to be used alone in advertisements:
   87.2% of the advertisements featuring reference pricing also include
   limited-time availability (i.e., "Three days only!") or sale
   announcements in the headline or copy. Using dual-process theories of
   persuasion as a conceptual framework, the authors conduct three field
   experiments that compare the conditions under which the use of
   limited-time availability and sale announcements in advertisements that
   feature reference prices affects consumer price perceptions and store
   shopping intentions. The findings yield three insights for reference
   price advertising. First, reference pricing results in favorable price
   perceptions and store shopping intentions only when consumers are
   shopping for a product. Second, when consumers are shopping for a
   product, reference pricing paired with limited-time availability results
   in more favorable price perceptions and store shopping intentions than
   the use of either technique alone. Third, the use of sale announcements
   and limited-time availability in reference price advertisements has a
   favorable effect on price perceptions and store shopping intentions when
   consumers are not shopping for a product.

AB The growth of private labels over the past decades has been attributed
   to various factors. This article formally addresses the link between
   private-label success and economic expansions and contractions using
   recently developed time-series/econometric techniques. The findings
   confirm conventional wisdom that a country's private-label share
   increases when the economy is suffering and shrinks when the economy is
   flourishing. However, asymmetries are found in the extent to and speed
   with which private-label share changes in cyclical up- versus downturns.
   Consumers switch more extensively to store brands during bad economic
   times than they switch back to national brands in a subsequent recovery.
   In addition, the switch to private-label brands is faster than the
   opposite movement to national brands after the recession ends. Finally,
   not only are consumers more prone to buy private labels during economic
   downturns, but some keep buying them when bad economic times are long
   over as well, leaving permanent "scars" on national brands' performance
   level. The authors argue that national-brand manufacturers can mitigate
   the effect of an economic downturn on their shares by intensifying their
   marketing-support activities in recessions. Such a proactive strategy is
   not often observed. On the contrary, available evidence suggests that
   many manufacturers exacerbate their predicament by cutting back on their
   marketing expenses when the economy turns sour. Most retailers invest
   more strongly in their private-label program when the economy
   deteriorates, making it even more difficult for national brands to catch
   up with the share lost during contractions.

AB Firms invest billions of dollars in sales technologies (STs; e.g.,

   sales force effectiveness and efficiency. However, the results expected
   from ST investments are often not achieved. This article proposes
   relationship-forging tasks that are critical to the link between ST use
   and key aspects of salesperson performance (i.e., a salesperson's
   relationship-building performance with customers and administrative
   performance). The authors evaluate relationship-forging tasks in the
   context of a model that considers the antecedents and consequences of
   three different uses of ST: accessing, analyzing, and communicating
   information. In general, the results of a field study, which is analyzed
   using block-recursive structural equation modeling, support the
   relationship-forging theory and show that relationship-forging tasks
   predict 57% of the variance in a salesperson's relationship-building
   performance with customers. The findings also support hypotheses that
   using ST either to analyze or to communicate information has mediated
   positive effects on a salesperson's relationship-building performance
   with customers. However, a salesperson's use of ST to analyze
   information has negative influences on administrative performance,
   creating an unexpected trade-off for sales and marketing managers.

AB Marketing executives are being urged to speak in the language of finance
   to gain internal support for marketing initiatives. Responding to this
   call, the authors examine the impact of a firm's advertising and its
   research and development (R&D) on the systematic risk of its stock, a
   key metric for publicly listed firms. They hypothesize that a firm's
   advertising and R&D expenditures create intangible assets that insulate
   it from stock market changes, lowering its systematic risk. They test
   the hypotheses using a panel data on 644 publicly listed firms between
   1979 and 2001, consisting of five-year moving windows. They scale the
   firm's advertising and R&D expenditures by its sales. After controlling
   for factors that accounting and finance researchers have shown to be
   associated with systematic risk, the authors find that advertising/sales
   and R&D/sales lower a firm's systematic risk. The article's findings
   extend prior research that has focused primarily on the effect of
   marketing initiatives on performance metrics without consideration of
   systematic risk. For practice, the ability of advertising and R&D to
   reduce systematic risk highlights the multifaceted implications of
   advertising and research programs. The article's findings may surprise
   senior management, some of whom are skeptical of the financial
   accountability of advertising programs.

AB The author investigates the impact of client control on supplier task
   performance in the burgeoning area of outsourced new product
   development. In relationships in which the outsourced task requires a
   high degree of creativity on the part of the supplier, ex ante
   contractual control is shown to increase supplier performance. In
   contrast, ex post client control is shown to reduce supplier
   performance, though certain highly skilled clients can overcome this
   effect. Behaviorally, clients exercise less control both ex ante and ex
   post in relationships in which the outsourced task requires a high
   degree of creativity on the part of the supplier. Managerially, the
   results suggest that clients should use more ex ante control to govern
   highly creative tasks. In general, clients should use less ex post
   control over such tasks, though highly skilled clients can actually
   benefit from using greater control.

AB There is consensus in the marketing literature that market knowledge and
   cross-functional collaboration are two fundamental resources for
   successful product innovation. However, few studies examine the
   dimensions or characteristics of market knowledge and how and why these
   resources influence product innovation performance. Drawing on
   contingency theory and the knowledge-based view of the firm, the authors
   argue that knowledge integration mechanisms may account for the effects
   of market knowledge dimensions (i.e., breadth, depth, tacitness, and
   specificity) and cross-functional collaboration on product innovation
   performance. They find that market knowledge specificity and
   cross-functional collaboration affect product innovation performance
   through knowledge integration mechanisms. In contrast, whereas the
   effect of market knowledge depth is partially mediated, market knowledge
   breadth has a direct, unmediated effect on product innovation
   performance. A test of an alternative moderating perspective shows that
   the effects of market knowledge depth and cross-functional collaboration
   on product innovation are negatively moderated by knowledge integration
   mechanisms. By showing the differential effects of market knowledge
   dimensions on product innovation performance, the authors provide a more
   refined understanding of the interplay among market knowledge, its
   integration, and the firm's performance in product innovation. The
   authors also conclude that by overlooking the role of knowledge
   integration mechanisms, previous research may have provided an overly
   optimistic view of the value of cross-functional collaboration in
   product innovation.

   to protect marketer capital influence marketers' job outcomes of
   organizational commitment, organizational trust, job satisfaction, and
   intention to turnover, which in turn influence the accumulation of
   capital more specific to the firm. The results demonstrate (1) that a
   protective governance structure in which marketers are able to obtain
   greater rewards internally than externally on more specific or less
   easily transferable capital does not enhance positive job outcomes and
   (2) that it is through the governance structures' influence on job
   outcomes, not through the governance structure itself, that marketing
   professionals are motivated to invest in the accumulation of capital
   specific to the firm. These results provide insights for senior
   marketing managers charged with developing a governance mechanism to
   both retain current marketing talent and develop a more effective
   marketing group.

AB As the use of online reverse auctions in industrial-sourcing activities
   grows, buyers and suppliers are increasingly concerned about these
   auctions' effects on their interorganizational performance (i.e.,
   suspicions of opportunism, overall satisfaction, and future
   expectations). This research examines how the buyer's auction design
   (i.e., the number of bidders, the economic stakes, and price visibility)
   and the price dynamics over the course of the auction affect its
   relationship with suppliers. Analysis of 25 quasi experiments involving
   125 suppliers and $385 million in procurement contracts suggests that
   the larger the number of bidders, the larger the economic stakes, and
   the less visible the price in an auction, the more positive is the
   impact on the interorganizational relationship. Large price drops
   (higher savings) over the course of the event have a detrimental effect
   on the buyer-supplier relationship. For auctions in which the lowest
   bidder wins, there is a decrease in opportunism suspicions as the
   economic stakes of the auction increase, and there is an increase in
   opportunism suspicions in auctions with greater price visibility.
   Implications for the management of industrial procurement activities are
   considered.

AB A large number of visualization tools have been created to help decision
   makers understand increasingly rich databases of product, customer,
   sales force, and other types of marketing information. This article
   presents a framework for thinking about how visual representations are
   likely to affect the decision processes or tasks that marketing managers
   and consumers commonly face, particularly those that involve the
   analysis or synthesis of substantial amounts of data. From this
   framework, the authors derive a set of testable propositions that serve
   as an agenda for further research. Although visual representations are
   likely to improve marketing manager efficiency, offer new insights, and
   increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, they may also bias decisions
   by focusing attention on a limited set of alternatives, increasing the
   salience and evaluability of less diagnostic information, and
   encouraging inaccurate comparisons. Given this, marketing managers are
   advised to subject insights from visual representations to more formal
   analysis.

   Consumers with higher organizational status prefer to give money versus
   time, but this preference is weaker for those with a highly

AB Although incidental affect has been shown to influence both attitude and
   purchase behavior, it has not been extended to actual consumption. This
   research investigates whether specific affective states influence food
   consumption and whether this influence is moderated by factors such as
   information and the nature of the product (hedonic versus less hedonic).
   The authors show that an integrative mood management and mood evaluation
   framework accounts for this relationship more effectively than a
   self-regulation explanation. A preliminary test and two lab studies show
   that people eat larger amounts of hedonic foods (buttered popcorn and
   M&M's) when they are in a sad state than when they are in a happy state
   and that this effect is attenuated when nutritional information is
   present. In contrast, they tend to eat larger amounts of a less hedonic
   product (raisins) when they are in a happy state than when they are in a
   sad state. The authors discuss implications for responsible marketers,
   health professionals, and health conscious consumers in the context of

AB A wide variety of theories across disciplines posit the existence of
   multiple inner preferences (selves, drives, or agents) within each
   person, whose conflicts must be resolved for a person to reach a
   decision. Despite their strong validity, these theories have not been
   incorporated into mainstream management science literature because of
   their qualitative nature. In this article, the author proposes a theory
   of intraperson games (TIG) to fill this important gap. Building on
   social welfare literature and standard (multiperson) game theory, the
   TIG defines two types of intraperson players, and each has a unique
   strategy set. The first type, the efficiency agent, attempts to maximize
   the total utility for the entire set of selves that reside in a person's
   mind. The second type, the equity agent, strives to balance the
   utilities that each of these selves receives. The TIG states that an
   individual decision is the outcome of the strategic interaction between
   the efficiency agent and the equity agent. Thus, standard consumer
   utility theory is a special case of the TIG if the role of the equity
   agent is ignored. A mathematical apparatus is provided for the TIG and
   is defined in a way similar to standard (multiperson) game theory. As a
   general quantitative theory, the TIG can be applied to many different
   contexts across disciplines, including, but not limited to, management
   science. The author demonstrates one such application for
   variety-seeking behavior and shows that stochastic variety seeking is a
   mixed-strategy equilibrium in an intraperson game. Key theoretical
   insights from this applied model are subsequently validated in an
   empirical study.

   (i.e., transfer). Corporate messages transferred more than a product

   product message had more influence than corporate messages for that
   product. Moreover, a corporate ability (quality) message transferred
   more to the portfolio than did a corporate social responsibility
   message. Finally, a competitive product message that preceded a company
   product message and was positioned similarly to a company product
   lessened corporate message diagnosticity, reducing transfer. However,

AB When deciding about changes in levels of multiple marketing investments
   aimed at improving profits, managers need to know whether they are on
   the uphill side or the downhill side of the profit function with respect
   to each investment variable. Spending errors made by an uphill-located
   firm that believes that it is a downhill-located firm can have serious
   consequences. This article offers an econometric "diagnostic tool" to
   infer a company's current location on a multivariable profit function
   and to determine the changes in investments that will take the company
   to the neighborhood of the maximum profit. The authors apply the
   proposed approach to daily newspaper industry data and investigate the
   optimality of companies' allocation behaviors with respect to three
   marketing efforts: investments in quality, distribution, and advertising
   space sales effort. A novel feature of this problem setting is that it
   involves a "dual-revenue" market with possibly interrelated demands for
   subscriptions and advertising space. The authors derive normative rules
   for marketing investments in four dual-revenue market types. The
   empirical analysis finds that daily newspapers' dual revenues are
   positively interrelated and that a majority of these companies are
   located near the optimal level of spending for quality, a surprising
   finding considering that previous studies have characterized marketing
   managers as overspenders. Indeed, when these companies are suboptimal,
   they are much more likely to be underspending (i.e., they are located on
   the uphill side of the profit function) than overspending. In addition,
   the research furnishes estimates of sales elasticities with respect to
   quality, personal selling, and distribution investments, which are
   sparsely available in the extant literature.

   consumers to illustrate how these memories symbolize the consumer-brand

   meaning. The findings indicate that people's earliest and defining
   experiences have an important influence on current and future
   preferences in predictable ways across the consumer life cycle. These
   memory experiences are symbolic to the consumer and represent a new lens
   for viewing brand meaning, which complements the toolbox of extant

AB Management of brand equity has come to be viewed as critical to a
   brand's optimal long-term performance. The authors evaluate the
   usefulness of brand equity estimates obtained from store-level data for
   monitoring the health of a brand. They use a random coefficients logit
   demand model calibrated on store-level scanner data to track brand
   equity estimates over time in two consumer packaged goods categories
   that experienced several new product introductions during the period of
   the empirical investigation. Using these tracked measures, the authors
   also study the impact of marketing actions, such as advertising, sales
   promotions, and product innovations, on brand equity. They find that the
   brand equity estimates effectively capture the high equity of strongly
   positioned popular brands and brands that command a significant price
   premium in niche markets. Using an example, the authors illustrate how
   these brand equity estimates can be used to monitor changes in brand
   equity, which measures such as market share may fail to capture. The
   substantive results indicate that advertising has a positive effect on
   brand equity in both the product categories, whereas the effect of sales
   promotions is not significant in either category. Furthermore, the
   results reveal that new product innovations have a positive impact on
   brand equity and can explain a significant proportion of its variation.
   Overall, the analysis shows that a brand manager can track brand equity
   using store-level data, gain insights into the drivers of the brand's
   equity, and manage these drivers to achieve brand equity targets.

   an inability to account for marketing's contribution has undermined its

   investing in the development of performance measurement abilities, but
   to date, there have been no empirical studies of whether the ability to
   measure marketing performance has any actual effect on either firm
   performance or marketing's stature. In this study of senior marketing
   managers in high-technology firms, the authors examine the effect of
   ability to measure marketing performance on firm performance, using both
   primary data collected from senior marketers and secondary data on firm
   profitability and stock returns. They also explore the effect of ability

   transactions with competing firms is often sparse or nonexistent. As a
   result, firms are often compelled to manage customer relationships from

   customers account for a large portion of all the external transactions,
   suggesting the considerable potential to increase sales if these

   characteristics have the greatest influence on second-channel adoption
   duration. In contrast, proportion of returns, a purchase-related

AB Although there is significant evidence that customer satisfaction is an
   important driver of firm profitability, extant literature has largely
   neglected two intermediate outcomes of customer satisfaction, namely, a
   firm's advertising and promotion efficiency and its human capital
   performance. On the basis of longitudinal analyses of large-scale
   secondary data from multiple sources, the authors find that customer
   satisfaction boosts the efficiency of future advertising and promotion
   investments. This finding can be explained by the possibility that
   customer satisfaction generates free word-of-mouth advertising and saves
   subsequent marketing costs. In addition, customer satisfaction has a
   positive influence on a company's excellence in human capital (employee
   talent and manager superiority). This finding is highly novel,
   indicating that human resources managers should have a strong interest
   in customer satisfaction as well. Finally, the authors investigate the
   moderating influence of market concentration on both relationships. The
   uncovered results have important implications for marketers in their

   basis of extant literature in economics, strategy, and marketing, the
   authors identify market- and firm-specific factors that influence exit
   behavior. They account for firms' uncertainty about a market's true
   attractiveness after entry on the probability of exiting a market. To
   evaluate exit decisions, they propose a Bayesian belief-updating model
   of learning embedded in a logit model that incorporates market- and
   firm-specific factors. The estimated evolution of beliefs over time
   enables the authors to determine whether firms use market information to
   update their prior beliefs about market attractiveness. The authors
   empirically investigate the market exits of new entrant discount
   airlines from city-pair markets. The results suggest that a combination
   of several market and firm factors influences exit behavior. Airlines'
   prior beliefs about market attractiveness are not necessarily consistent
   with the market's intrinsic attractiveness, and firms learn about the
   true market attractiveness over time. The authors also provide model
   comparisons with extant approaches to studying market exit and find that
   the proposed approach provides a better fit and predictive ability.

   individual adoption behavior with a sample of 6000 customers of a Dutch

   that service advertising shortens the time to adoption, even when it is

AB For a seller that markets event tickets both in advance and on spot, a

   conventional wisdom is for the seller to consider completely banning

   which resale is only partially restricted; specifically, resale is
   banned on spot but still allowed in advance. Using a two-period model in
   which buyers have discreet valuations, the authors show that it is
   possible for partial resale to outperform no resale (and also
   unrestricted resale at the other extreme) in terms of seller
   profitability when the following conditions hold: when the seller has
   limited capacity, when the number of high-valuation buyers is small
   enough, and when the number of early arrivers is not too large. An
   implication of this research is that when consumers conduct advance and
   spot resale in different channels, such as advance resale online and
   spot resale off line, the seller may be better off adopting different
   resale policies for different channels.

AB International entries into transition economies occur infrequently and
   involve considerable uncertainty. This raises the question whether
   managers, who have limited own experience, take their competitors' prior
   decisions into account when deciding on their own entry timing and size
   and whether there is value in doing so. To address these questions, the
   authors estimate a sequential hazard/Poisson regression model on the top
   75 European grocery retailers' decisions to enter the Eastern European
   market. Indeed, firms pay close attention to prevailing practices in
   their industry. Prior entries first serve as legitimation but eventually
   become a deterring factor. Moreover, rather than just imitating the most
   popular or modal decision when determining the own entry timing and
   size, managers pay closer attention to the actions of their home
   competitors, react to prior entries of same-format competitors
   differently from those of different-format competitors, and adjust the
   observed industry practice for the specificity of their own resources.
   The authors show that managers are justified in taking the combined
   industry wisdom into account; deviations from prevailing industry
   practice, in terms of both timing and size, hurt the efficiency of their
   operations in subsequent years. Thus, attempts to develop own, distinct
   entry rules tend to be dysfunctional. Moreover, corrective actions are
   easier to implement along the size than along the time dimension; the
   detrimental effects of entering at a different time from the industry
   norm persist and even become amplified over time, whereas the negative
   impact of size deviations is temporary.

AB This study draws on depth interviews with 49 managers in customer firms
   and 55 managers in supplier firms and on discussions with 21 managers in
   two focus groups to propose a new way of thinking about customer
   solutions. Extant literature and suppliers interviewed for this study
   view a solution as a customized and integrated combination of goods and
   services for meeting a customer's business needs. In contrast, customers
   view a solution as a set of customer-supplier relational processes
   comprising (1) customer requirements definition, (2) customization and
   integration of goods and/or services and (3) their deployment, and (4)
   postdeployment customer support, all of which are aimed at meeting
   customers' business needs. The relational process view can help
   suppliers deliver more effective solutions at profitable prices. In
   addition, field research suggests that the effectiveness of a solution
   depends not only on supplier variables but also on several customer
   variables. Supplier variables include contingent hierarchy,
   documentation emphasis, incentive externality, customer interactor
   stability, and process articulation. Customer variables include
   adaptiveness to supplier offerings and political and operational
   counseling that a customer provides to a supplier. Several of these
   variables underscore the importance of suppliers developing social
   capital with customers. The authors discuss implications for solution
   suppliers and identify areas for further research.

AB Indirect network effects are of prime interest to marketers because they
   affect the growth and takeoff of software availability for and hardware
   sales of a new product. Although prior work on indirect network effects
   in the economics and marketing literature is valuable, there are two
   main shortcomings. First, empirical analysis of indirect network effects
   is rare. Second, in contrast to the importance prior literature credits
   to the "chicken-and-egg" paradox in these markets, the temporal pattern
   (i.e., Which leads to which?) of indirect network effects remains
   unstudied. Based on empirical evidence of nine markets, this study shows
   that (1) indirect network effects, as commonly operationalized by prior
   literature, are weaker than expected from prior literature and (2) in
   most markets examined, hardware sales "lead" software availability,
   whereas the reverse almost never happens, contrary to existing beliefs.
   These findings are supported by multiple methods, such as takeoff and
   time-series analyses, and fit with the histories of the markets studied
   herein. For academia, the study identifies a need for new and more
   relevant conceptualizations of indirect network effects. For public
   policy, it questions the need for intervention in network markets. For
   management practice, it downplays the importance of the availability of
   a large library of software for hardware technology to be successful.

AB Prior research has largely focused on the positive side of customer
   experience, such as satisfaction. In contrast, this study investigates
   the negative side of customer experience and tests the harmful impact of
   consumer negative voice on firms' stock returns. Based on a longitudinal
   real-world data set that matches consumer negative voice (complaint
   records) in the airline industry with firm stock prices, this article
   finds that higher levels of current consumer negative voice harm firms'
   future idiosyncratic stock returns. In addition, this harmful impact is
   robust (albeit different across airline companies) after latent
   heterogeneity and traditional finance fundamentals are considered. These
   findings enable marketers and corporate financers to be more confident
   with customer equity theory and customer relationship management. In
   addition, armed with "hard" data (record-based, longitudinal), this
   research helps relieve criticisms against prior studies that are based
   on "soft" data (survey-based, cross-sectional). To financial analysts,
   this research suggests that, all else being equal, they should rate
   downward the stocks of firms that are shadowed by harmful consumer
   negative voice. In today's high-tech environment with blogs and online
   forums, the damage caused by negative voice may be nontrivial and should
   not be ignored. Overall, this research demonstrates to managers that
   investments in reducing consumer negative voice could indeed make
   financial sense in terms of promoting firm-idiosyncratic stock returns.

AB This article focuses on a novel mechanism for market segmentation and

   Using the automotive retailing context as the setting for the study, the
   authors address the following question: Can online infomediaries serve
   as a viable mechanism for market segmentation and price discrimination?
   They draw on a unique and extensive data set of consumers who report on
   the information they found when using online buying services (OBS) as
   part of their new vehicle purchase process. The analysis of the data set
   shows that consumers who obtain price information pay lower prices (for
   the same product), whereas consumers who obtain product information pay
   higher prices. Although this points to the existence of distinct
   consumer segments, this knowledge is of limited value without a viable
   mechanism that enables firms to identify and target these customer
   segments specifically. On the basis of consumer usage patterns of OBS,
   the authors uncover distinct OBS clusters and empirically demonstrate
   that the use of these different clusters is associated with predicted
   differences in consumer outcomes. They also show that the differential
   use of OBS clusters is systematically related to underlying consumer
   characteristics. They discuss the relevance of the findings for
   automobile dealers and manufacturers and for other industries in which
   online infomediaries have established a significant presence.

   relationship; that is, for many pairs of firms, the overall relationship
   between the two firms is composed of multiple simple relationships:
   supplier to customer, and vice versa; competitor to competitor; and
   partners. This multiplicity of relationships can lead to both
   opportunities and challenges for each of the two firms in the dyad. The
   authors define the nature of compound relationships and delineate why it
   is important for the firm to treat them as such rather than focusing
   only on the simple relationships. They distinguish compound
   relationships from social networks and simple dyadic relationships and
   relate the construct to exchange theory, "coopetition," and the
   interorganizational relationship literature in marketing. They then use
   the political economy framework to develop a set of conceptual
   propositions that apply to many aspects of compound relationships. They
   end with some speculations regarding the appropriate management of
   compound relationships and propose opportunities for further research.

AB The literature is divided on whether differences between the thought

   article empirically investigates various facets of thought-world
   differences and their effects on various outcomes. It confirms that, in
   general, differences hamper the cooperation between marketing and sales,
   which leads to a lower market performance of the business unit. However,
   some facets of thought-world differences enhance the market performance
   of the business unit through a direct effect that outweighs the negative
   effect mediated by the quality of cooperation between marketing and
   sales. Market performance is enhanced if one side plays the customers'
   advocate while the other plays the products' advocate. Market
   performance is also enhanced if one side plays the advocate of
   short-term considerations while the other plays the advocate of
   long-term considerations. In contrast, differences between marketing and
   sales in regard to product knowledge and interpersonal skills are
   deleterious to market performance. Thus, the kind of difference makes a

   The authors investigate how the social cues inherent in avatars
   influence consumers' affect and shopping value. In Study 1, social cues
   induce perceptions of Web site socialness, leading to increased pleasure
   and arousal, both of which positively influence flow, hedonic and
   utilitarian value, and patronage intentions. Study 2 finds that social
   cue-induced arousal leads to increased pleasure only for consumers who
   are involved with the product category. Moreover, the influence of
   arousal on hedonic value is stronger for women, flow does not lead to
   pleasure for older consumers, and utilitarian value is less important
   for this group than for their younger counterparts. The findings suggest
   that there is a competitive advantage for online retailers that use
   social cues that provide consumers with enhanced perceptions of human

   as promotion depth increases, consumers might lower their expectations

   return to normal levels. This research examines how promotion frame
   (percentage off versus cents off) moderates the effect of promotion
   depth on postpromotion price expectations and choice. The findings
   indicate that compared with cents-off promotions, high-depth
   percentage-off promotions lead to higher postpromotion price
   expectations. Likewise, postpromotion choice is higher when high-depth
   promotions are framed in percentage-off than cents-off terms. The
   authors examine the process underlying the effect of promotion frame on

AB Why do some articles become building blocks for future scholars, whereas
   others remain unnoticed? The authors aim to answer this question by
   contrasting, synthesizing, and simultaneously testing three
   scientometric perspectives-universalism, social constructivism, and
   presentation-on the influence of article and author characteristics on
   article citations. They study all articles published in a sample of five
   major journals in marketing from 1990 to 2002 that are central to the
   discipline. They count the number of citations each of these articles
   has received and regress this count on an extensive set of
   characteristics of the article (i.e., article quality, article domain,
   title length, the use of attention grabbers, and expositional clarity)
   and the author (i.e., author visibility and author personal promotion).
   They find that the number of citations an article in the marketing
   discipline receives depends more on "what is said" (quality and domain)
   and "who says it" (author visibility and personal promotion) than on
   "how it is said" (title length, the use of attention grabbers, and
   expositional clarity). The insights gleaned from this analysis
   contribute to the marketing literature and are relevant to scientific
   stakeholders, such as the management of scientific journals and
   individual academic scholars, as they strive to maximize citations. They
   are also relevant to marketing practitioners; they inform practitioners
   on characteristics of the academic journals in marketing and their
   relevance to decisions they face. Conversely, the insights also raise
   challenges regarding how to make journals accessible and relevant to
   marketing practitioners: (1) Authors visible to academics are not
   necessarily visible to practitioners; (2) the readability of an article
   may hurt academic credibility and impact, but it may be instrumental in
   influencing practitioners; and (3) it remains questionable whether
   articles that academics assess to be of high quality are also
   managerially relevant.

AB Service recovery research remains conflicted in its understanding of
   consumers' recovery expectations and of why similar goods or service
   failures may lead to different recovery expectations. The authors argue
   that this conflict results from the assumption that consumer recovery
   expectations are monolithic and largely homogeneous, driven mainly by
   behavioral, relational, or contextual stimuli. Instead, recovery
   scenarios involving high-involvement (i.e., self-relevant) goods and
   service failures may activate closely held, identity-related cultural
   models that, though ultimately applied to regain balance (a foundational
   schema), differ according to their sociocultural heritage and create a
   range of unique consumer recovery preferences. The authors empirically
   identify three embodied cultural models-relational, oppositional, and
   utilitarian-that consumers apply to goods or service failures.
   Furthermore, the authors discuss implications for service recovery
   research and services marketing practice and introduce adaptive service
   recovery diagnostics that enable providers to identify and respond to
   consumers' varying recovery preferences.

AB Illegal consumer file sharing of motion pictures is considered a major

   scholars postulate a cannibalistic effect on commercial forms of movie
   consumption, other researchers deny this effect, though sound evidence
   is lacking on both sides. Drawing on extant research and utility theory,
   the authors present hypotheses on the consequences and determinants of
   consumer file sharing and test them with data from a controlled
   longitudinal panel study of German consumers. The data contain
   information on the consumers' intentions toward and actual behavior in
   relation to the consumption of 25 new motion pictures, allowing the
   authors to study more than 10,000 individual file-sharing opportunities.
   The authors test the effect of file sharing on commercial movie
   consumption using a series of ReLogit regression analyses and apply
   partial least squares structural equation modeling to identify the
   determinants of consumer file sharing. They find evidence of substantial
   cannibalization of theater visits, DVD rentals, and DVD purchases
   responsible for annual revenue losses of $300 million in Germany. Five
   categories of file-sharing behavior drive file sharing and have a

   franchise, the study shows that consumers who were heavy buyers at the
   beginning of a loyalty program were most likely to claim their qualified
   rewards, but the program did not prompt them to change their purchase
   behavior. In contrast, consumers whose initial patronage levels were low
   or moderate gradually purchased more and became more loyal to the firm.
   For light buyers, the loyalty program broadened their relationship with
   the firm into other business areas. The findings suggest a need to

   service firms (e.g., airlines, hotels, car rentals) systematically
   overbook capacity, thus striving to maximize the revenue at one
   particular point in time (i.e., one flight, one night, and one day). The
   academic literature has not addressed how customers behaviorally respond
   to overbooking experiences, such as downgrading, denied service, or
   upgrading. In this article, the authors use the econometric technique of
   conditional difference-in-differences analysis to study the effect of
   such incidences on customer usage patterns in an airline context. They
   find that customers who experience negative consequences of revenue
   management significantly reduce the amount of their transactions with
   the airline, whereas upgraded customers exhibit only weak positive
   responses. The effects of the negative events are stronger for
   high-value customer groups, whereas significant effects of positive
   events can be found only for a low-value customer group. The results
   suggest the need for a stronger focus on customer reactions to revenue
   management practices. On a more general level, the study contributes to
   a more interdisciplinary view of service management by demonstrating the
   need for a closer interaction between management functions (e.g.,
   marketing and operations) in developing and managing concepts of
   companywide importance.

AB This article introduces quasi-Darwinian selection as a new explanatory
   paradigm for marketing relationships. In this paradigm, established
   relationships are viewed as survivors of a selection process whose
   parameters are the conduct of the partners, dependencies between the
   partners, and external adversities in the markets. Selection has the
   effect of culling certain combinations of these parameters, such as
   attempts at unilateral control when the partner is not dependent. The
   effect of selection is to carve out patterns that appear as associations
   between parameters, for example, between unilateral control and
   dependence. Traditionally, such associations have been interpreted as
   causal effects of one parameter on the other. This study shows that
   quasi-Darwinian selection may sometimes be the more correct explanation
   of an observed association. The guiding principle can be summarized by
   the motto "selection creates association." As an explanatory paradigm,
   selection may rival causation. The quasi-Darwinian framework applies to
   any type of marketing relationships in the business-to-business and
   business-to-consumer markets. Examples include all relationships in the
   supply chain, relationships between service providers and customers, and
   relationships between sales representatives and customers. The article
   develops the quasi-Darwinian framework in generality, but it emphasizes
   applications to business-to-business relationships. When associations
   between relationship parameters are carved out by selection, they can be
   interpreted as adaptations, and their descriptive meaning has normative
   implications; if partners in a relationship pattern their conduct
   according to these associations, on average, they may enhance the
   longevity of their relationship.

AB Movies and other media goods are traditionally distributed across
   distinct sequential channels (e.g., theaters, home video, video on
   demand). The optimality of the currently employed timing and order of
   channel openings has become a matter of contentious debate among both
   industry experts and marketing scholars. In this article, the authors
   present a model of revenue generation across four sequential
   distribution channels, combining choice-based conjoint data with other
   information. Drawing on stratified random samples for three major
   markets-namely, the United States, Japan, and Germany-and a total of
   1770 consumers, the empirical results suggest that the studios that
   produce motion pictures can increase their revenues by up to 16.2%
   through sequential distribution chain timing and order changes when
   applying a common distribution model for all movies in a country and
   that revenue-optimizing structures differ strongly among countries.
   Under the conditions of the study, the authors find that the
   simultaneous release of movies in theaters and on rental home video
   generates maximum revenues for movie studios in the United States but
   has devastating effects on other players, such as theater chains. The
   authors discuss different scenarios and their implications for movie
   studios and other industry players, and barriers for the implementation
   of the revenue-maximizing distribution models are critically reflected.

AB The current literature presents a mixed view of top managers, often

   innovation, or, at best, having an indirect effect on innovation. In
   contrast, the authors use an attentional perspective to argue that chief

   on how firms detect, develop, and deploy new technologies over time. The
   authors test their arguments on longitudinal data from the U.S. retail
   banking industry. They show that CEO attention is a critical driver of
   innovation even (1) when the target of attention is not innovation per
   se but simply future events and external events in a generic sense; (2)
   when the innovation outcomes occur far in the future (sometimes several
   years in the future); (3) when the innovation outcomes are conceptually,
   empirically, and temporally distinct; and (4) in an empirical context
   (i.e., banking) that is not traditionally viewed as "high tech" and,
   thus, innovation centric.

AB Is the involvement of stars critical to the success of motion pictures?
   Film studios, which regularly pay multimillion-dollar fees to stars,
   seem to be driven by that belief. This article sheds light on the
   returns on this investment using an event study that considers the
   impact of more than 1200 casting announcements on trading behavior in a
   simulated and real stock market setting. The author finds evidence that
   the involvement of stars affects movies' expected theatrical revenues
   and provides insight into the magnitude of this effect. For example, the
   estimates suggest that, on average, stars are worth approximately $3
   million in theatrical revenues. In a cross-sectional analysis grounded
   in the literature on group dynamics, the author also examines the
   determinants of the magnitude of stars' impact on expected revenues.
   Among other things, the author shows that the stronger a cast already
   is, the greater is the impact of a newly recruited star with a track
   record of box office successes or with a strong artistic reputation.
   Finally, in an extension to the study, the author does not find that the
   involvement of stars in movies increases the valuation of film companies
   that release the movies, thus providing insufficient grounds to conclude
   that stars add more value than they capture. The author discusses
   implications for managers in the motion picture industry.

AB Although combining friendship and business in the same relationship can
   be beneficial, it can also create conflict. A source of this conflict is
   incompatible relational expectations. True friends are expected to be
   unmotivated by benefits that can be used beyond the relationship (e.g.,
   money, status), whereas business partners are, by definition, at least
   partly motivated by these more "instrumental" concerns. Using a role
   theory framework and data collected from a survey of 685 direct-selling
   agents, this article reports evidence that a conflict between friendship
   and instrumentality can undermine some of the business outcomes that
   friendship might otherwise foster. It also suggests that this conflict
   is more severe for friendships that become business relationships than
   for business relationships that become friendships. Study conclusions do
   not suggest that friendship is entirely "bad" for business and, instead,
   propose that friendship's influence can be both positive and negative.

AB A consumer contest is a sales promotion technique that requires
   participants to apply certain skills as they compete for prizes or
   awards. This article is the first to employ a game-theoretical approach
   to investigate consumer contest design issues, including prize
   structure, segmentation, and handicapping. First, the authors find that
   both skill distribution and the number of contestants play an important
   role in determining the optimal prize structure in consumer contests.
   Specifically, if the skill distribution has the increasing hazard-rate
   property, it is optimal for a marketer to use a winner-take-all design.
   In large contests, for the winner-take-all approach to be optimal, it
   suffices to have the increasing hazard-rate property only at the high
   end of the skill distribution. Second, increasing contest size is
   beneficial to the marketer. Third, a less dispersive skill distribution
   leads to higher consumption by consumers at all skill levels and thus is
   beneficial to the marketer. The marketer may achieve less dispersive
   skill distributions by (1) segmenting or screening contestants according
   to their skill levels and (2) adopting a performance evaluation scheme
   that handicaps high-skilled contestants.

AB Four theoretical perspectives currently dominate attempts to understand
   the drivers of successful interorganizational relationship performance:
   (1) commitment-trust, (2) dependence, (3) transaction cost economics,
   and (4) relational norms. Each perspective specifies a different set and
   distinct causal ordering of focal constructs as the most critical for
   understanding performance. Using four years of longitudinal data (N =
   396), the authors compare the relative efficacy of these four
   perspectives for driving exchange performance and provide empirical
   insights into the causal ordering among key interorganizational
   constructs. The results demonstrate the parallel and equally important
   roles of commitment-trust and relationship-specific investments as
   immediate precursors to and key drivers of exchange performance.
   Building on the insights gleaned from tests of the four frameworks, the
   authors parsimoniously integrate these perspectives within a single
   model of interfirm relationship performance consistent with a
   resource-based view of an exchange. Managers may be able to increase
   performance by shifting resources from "relationship building" to
   specific investments targeted toward increasing the efficacy or
   effectiveness of the relationship itself to improve the relationship's
   ability to create value. Moderation analysis indicates that managers may
   find it productive to allocate more relationship marketing efforts and
   investments to exchanges in markets with higher levels of uncertainty.

AB Applying a configuration-theoretic approach to study multiple channels,
   the authors hypothesize that multiple-channel systems make their
   greatest contributions to firm performance when their structures are
   properly aligned with their firms' business-level strategies and with
   environmental conditions. A conceptual model incorporating these
   variables is supported in an empirical study of responses from
   executives at 291 electronic component manufacturers. The results
   confirm the existence of two theoretically ideal configurations. As
   hypothesized, channels in these ideal configurations make greater
   contributions to their firms' performance than do channels in
   alternative configurations. Moreover, a profile deviation analysis shows
   that a channel system's contribution to its firm's performance is
   greatest when that channel system's structural profile is closest to the
   profiles of top contributing channel systems operating under similar
   strategic and environmental conditions. The authors present specific
   guidelines to help managers design distribution systems for different

   segmentation. A matrix is proposed for segmentation that distinguishes
   between strategic and operational levels and the degree to which new
   value is created.
   Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual discussion aims at
   contributing to development of the discussion of segmentation purpose.
   Findings - Several models have emerged in the segmentation literature,
   but the purposes of many segmentation models are not explicitly
   addressed. However, the purpose of a model affects the segmentation
   process and has ramifications to the subsequent implementation. This
   paper links segmentation to the purpose of segmenting and discusses the
   degree to which previous choices have impact on a firm's possibility to
   select and implement new segments.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper contributes to a more
   extensive discussion on segmentation. It adds to the discussion on
   segmentation purpose and implementation problems.
   Originality/value - The proposed matrix sheds new light on the
   importance of having a clear purpose with a model. Furthermore, it is
   shown that different purposes may have different ramifications to the
   firm and be more or less simple to implement, depending on the degree to
   which changes in the firms' activities, actors and resources are needed.
   Likewise, changes in established relationships have to be implemented or

   indirectly or directly, the tendency to pirate depends, to different
   extents, on three key factors: positive incentives (e.g., improved
   functionality of the legal Web site), negative incentives (e.g.,
   perceived risk of piracy), and consumer characteristics. Based on three
   studies, the results suggest that negative incentives are a strong
   deterrent for certain consumers but can actually increase piracy

   functionality, can significantly reduce the tendency to pirate among all

AB It is widely accepted that marketing initiatives help firms acquire and
   retain customers. However, the link between the cash flows generated by
   customers' purchases and shareholders' wealth is not fully understood,
   and the literature is increasingly advocating the need for greater
   "marketing accountability." In this interdisciplinary research, the
   authors adapt the theory of firm valuation from finance and show that a
   marketing action can affect the shareholders' wealth by (1) determining
   the firm's net present value (the "stock price effect") and (2)
   potentially reducing the firm's cash needs (the "released working
   capital effect"). In demonstrating these results, the authors advance
   marketing theory by answering calls made in the literature to link
   marketing actions to the investors' cash flows, the firm's working
   capital needs, and the owners' wealth. The approach also shows that by
   reducing the firm's cash needs, marketing can increase the firm's
   productivity (operating efficiency). This imputes a critically important
   role for marketing. By increasing productivity, marketing can increase
   the firm's competitive posture and, thus, its long-term viability.

AB Marketing managers are being required to demonstrate the profitability
   of their marketing actions down to the level of their individual
   customers and on an ongoing basis. At the same time, customers expect
   firms to increasingly customize their products and services to meet
   their demands. Firms still need to produce superior products, sell
   smarter, and understand the markets as a whole, but the ability of firms
   to orient themselves to interact successfully with their individual
   customers will differentiate them in the future. Advances in technology
   have resulted in increasing opportunities for interactions between firms
   and customers, between customers, and between firms. An interaction
   orientation reflects a firm's ability to interact with its individual
   customers and to take advantage of information obtained from them
   through successive interactions to achieve profitable customer
   relationships. First, the authors identify the components of interaction
   orientation: (1) customer concept, (2) interaction response capacity,
   (3) customer empowerment, and (4) customer value management. Second,
   they relate interaction orientation to both customer-level and
   aggregate-level performance measures. Third, they identify the
   antecedents of interaction orientation. Fourth, they examine the
   moderating effects of customer-initiated contacts and competitive
   intensity on the interaction orientation-performance linkage. The
   results are based on a survey of top marketing managers. The commonly
   held view that customer-based relational performance is related to
   customer-based profit performance is not supported. However, both
   customer-based relational performance and customer-based profit
   performance affect aggregate business-level performance positively.
   Interaction orientation is a phenomenon observed in both
   business-to-business and business-to-consumer firms. The extent of
   customer-initiated contacts moderates the interaction
   orientation-performance relationship.

AB This article develops a model of a business customer's decision to
   upgrade service contracts conditional on the decision to renew the
   contract. It proposes that the firm's upgrade decision is influenced by
   (1) decision-maker perceptions of the relationship with the supplier,
   (2) contract-level experiences, and (3) interactions between firm-and
   contract-level variables. The authors model the firm's decision as a
   binary logit model with random parameters for the contract-level
   variables and fixed parameters for the firm-level variables. They
   estimate the model with data describing more than 2000 service contracts
   and find that decision-maker satisfaction, service quality, and price
   have a significant effect on the decision to upgrade; price and
   satisfaction also moderate the effect of service quality on the
   decision. Simulations indicate that modest improvements in service
   quality for a focal contract can have a relatively large, positive
   effect on the likelihood that the firm will upgrade. The results suggest
   that suppliers need to manage their firm relationships at both the
   individual contract level and the overall firm level. In addition, the
   results suggest specific windows of opportunity for suppliers when firms
   may be more likely to upgrade to higher-level service contracts.

AB Service churn and retention rates remain central as constructs in
   marketing activities, such as valuation of service subscribers and
   resource allocation. Although extant approaches have been proposed to
   relate service churn to external factors, such as reported satisfaction,
   marketing-mix activities, and so on, managers often face situations in
   which the only information available is the duration for which
   subscribers have had service. In such cases, can they forecast service
   churn and understand the contributing factors, which may allow for
   subsequent intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine
   factors that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting.
   Specifically, they use a model of retention that accounts for (1)
   duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber
   heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time effects
   (e.g., seasonality). Then, they apply the framework to subscription
   databases of seven services offered by a telecommunications provider,
   mirroring the format commonly used to forecast future service churn (and
   to make managerial decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion
   of promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of
   retention behavior, whereas including cross-cohort effects does not
   significantly improve it. In five of the services, customer
   heterogeneity, calendar-time effects, and duration dependence also
   contribute to improved forecasts. The authors use these results to
   understand how the expected value of a subscription differs across model
   specifications. They find considerable variation across model
   specifications, indicating that model misspecification can affect
   resource allocation decisions and other marketing efforts that are
   important to a firm.

AB The authors examine how a service firm's longevity may affect consumers'
   perceptions of risk in conducting business with the firm. Depending on
   the nature of information available to consumers, a firm's longevity can
   act in one of two ways to reduce the consumers' perceived risk: (1)
   Longevity may act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's quality, or (2)
   availability of a longer track record of an older firm may allow
   consumers to make more precise prediction of the firm's future quality.
   The authors develop a set of hypotheses that relate these two effects to
   consumers' preferences and test them in a series of four experiments.
   They find that a firm's age can act as an extrinsic cue of the firm's
   quality. When consumers also have information about firms' intrinsic
   attributes, the effect of a firm's age as an extrinsic cue is diminished
   under conditions of high involvement. The experiments also show that
   consumers prefer firms with longer track records, especially when firms'
   performance/quality levels are subject to more variability. However,
   when consumers have high aspiration levels, they prefer firms with
   shorter track records, even though the consumers perceive these firms as
   riskier choices.

AB This article argues that Stage-Gate controls have the potential of
   restricting learning in a new product development project and thus
   hurting the performance of novel new products. Specifically, the authors
   examine whether control on new product development exercised through
   rigorous gate review criteria increases project inflexibility, which in
   turn leads to increased failure to learn. They also focus on whether the
   effect of project inflexibility is worsened when there is turbulence in
   the firm's technological and market environment. Furthermore, the
   authors study whether failure to learn can have an adverse effect on new
   product performance when the product is novel. Finally, they examine
   whether a certain relaxation in gate evaluation (gate conditionality)
   that has been suggested recently mitigates the adverse effect of
   rigorously enforced controls. The results, which are based on a survey
   of 120 projects that used the Stage-Gate process for new product
   development, show that repeated application of strictly enforced and
   objective evaluation criteria for improved control makes projects more
   inflexible. Gate conditionality does not mitigate the adverse effect of
   gate review criteria. Project inflexibility leads to learning failure,
   and this effect is worsened when the technological environment of the
   firm is turbulent. In turn, learning failure adversely affects the
   market performance of novel new products.

AB The authors develop a conceptual framework of the factors that motivate
   a retailer's decision to rely on demand conditions and past prices in
   setting current and future prices. Specifically, they examine the
   circumstances under which retailers choose demand-based pricing versus
   past-price dependence for different brands and categories. Given scarce
   resources and costs of price adjustments, demand-based pricing is more
   likely when the customer-driven and firm-driven costs of adjusting
   pricing patterns are low or when the benefits of such adjustments are
   high. First, the customer-driven benefits of demand-based pricing are
   expected to be greater in categories with higher penetration and for
   brands with higher market share and higher demand sensitivity to price.
   Second, the firm-driven benefits are greater for categories with higher
   private-label share. Finally, the customer-driven costs are greater for
   expensive categories, whereas the firm-driven costs are greater for
   categories with many stockkeeping units. The empirical findings support
   the conceptual framework, implying that customer-driven and firm-driven
   benefits are the main stimulants in the retailer's choice of
   demand-based pricing. In contrast, customer-driven and firm-driven costs
   significantly hinder retailer implementation of demand-based pricing.
   These insights enable retailers to identify problem areas and
   opportunities to improve the allocation of scarce pricing resources. The
   results also contribute to the ongoing debate in economics and marketing
   on the rationality of observed past-price dependence. Whereas previous
   research points to the negative impact on gross margins of this
   practice, the authors find that retailers weigh the costs and benefits
   of demand-based pricing rather than adhere to past-pricing patterns.

AB This study identifies a frontline mechanism comprising autonomy,

   pursuit of quality and productivity orientations has positive or
   negative effects on unit revenue, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
   An empirical test of the proposed framework using data from 423
   employees in 30 strategic business units and longitudinal unit-level
   performance data indicates that frontline autonomy mediates the positive
   impact of productivity and quality orientations on unit revenue and
   customer satisfaction and their negative impact on unit efficiency.
   Feedback amplifies the influence of frontline autonomy by simultaneously
   enhancing its positive effect on satisfaction and its negative effect on
   efficiency. In contrast, unit cohesion strengthens the positive effect
   of frontline autonomy on revenue and customer satisfaction without
   augmenting its negative effect on unit efficiency. The results urge
   managers to shift their focus toward unit-level mechanisms to find clues
   for managing strategic dilemmas that stem from multiple goal pursuit in

AB Convergence in the electronics sector has enabled the addition of
   disparate new functionalities to existing base products (e.g., adding
   mobile television to a cell phone or Internet access to a personal
   digital assistant). This research investigates the role of two
   factors-(1) the goal congruence between the added functionality and the
   base and (2) the nature of the base product (utilitarian versus
   hedonic)-on the evaluation of such convergent products (CPs). The author
   proposes that the evaluation of CPs with a utilitarian versus hedonic
   base is subject to an asymmetric additivity effect. Specifically,
   whereas CPs with a utilitarian base gain more from adding an
   incongruent, hedonic functionality than a congruent, utilitarian one,
   CPs with a hedonic base gain less from an incongruent, utilitarian
   addition than a congruent, hedonic one. This asymmetry is because
   hedonic additions enhance the pleasure of using a utilitarian base,
   whereas utilitarian additions may dilute the existing hedonic image of a
   hedonic base. The moderating role of prior ownership of the base of a CP
   is also explored. The author proposes that the effects of goal
   congruence are stronger for owners than for nonowners, but only for CPs
   with a hedonic base, not for those with a utilitarian base. The author
   verifies the proposed effects in an experimental study conducted with a
   large-scale, representative sample of the target market population.
   Further research on other (moderating) factors affecting the evaluation
   of CPs is also suggested.

AB Drawing on research from the interfirm relationship, marketing channels,
   operations management, and network theory literature and on the basis of
   qualitative depth interviews, the authors identify a new phenomenon they
   call "supply chain contagion." Supply chain contagion is the propagation
   of interfirm behaviors from one dyadic relationship to an adjacent
   dyadic relationship within the supply chain. Contagion can occur
   inadvertently and with or without the knowledge of the affected parties.
   Using institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model that
   predicts the conditions under which contagion is likely to occur.
   Although contagion may take the form of any number of interfirm
   behaviors, operationally, the authors focus on whether the downstream
   influence strategies that manufacturers use with their dealers are
   imitated by these same dealers with end customers. They conduct
   conclusive research using a sample of 151 vertically linked
   manufacturer-dealer-customer supply chain triads and explain a large
   variance (R-2 =.30) in the use of downstream influence strategies in
   terms of supply chain contagion. Given extensive prior empirical support
   for alternative antecedents to influence strategy usage, the explanatory
   power of supply chain contagion is impressive and suggests that how
   intermediaries treat end customers is explained, to a large degree, as
   the intermediaries simply imitating how their suppliers treated them. In
   addition to the identification of a new theoretical concept, the study
   provides empirical support for the effects of both macro- and
   microinstitutional factors on interfirm behavior. Specific factors that
   are positively related to the level of manifest contagion are
   environmental uncertainty and the perceived similarity and frequency of
   contact between boundary personnel; dependence asymmetry has a negative
   effect on manifest contagion. Managers and boundary-spanning personnel
   who are aware of supply chain contagion effects should be better able to
   influence strategically the behavior of channel. partners and may be
   better inoculated against their own unintended imitation of other
   organizations within their supply chain.

   organizational levels in a marketing collaboration: interorganizational
   trust between collaborating firms, each firm's agency trust in its own
   representatives assigned to a collaborative entity (coentity), and
   intraentity trust among the representatives assigned to the coentity.
   Dyadic survey and longitudinal objective performance data from 114
   international joint ventures indicate that trust at each level has
   unique effects but similarly influences the collaborating firms'
   resource investments or the coentity's use of those resources.
   Interorganizational and agency trust motivate resource investments in
   the coentity, particularly in the context of a differentiation strategy,
   whereas intraentity trust promotes coordination within the coentity, and
   interorganizational trust and a differentiation strategy magnify that
   effect. Intraentity trust can also undermine coentity responsiveness to
   environmental change, especially when joined by interorganizational
   trust between collaborating firms and formalized decision making within
   the coentity. These findings demonstrate that managing and building
   trust at multiple levels is critical to the success of

AB Interactivity is a key feature of Web sites. This article identifies the
   determinants that enhance user perceptions of interactivity in a
   communication scenario in which consumers send instant messages to an
   e-store. Two conceptualizations of interactivity-telepresence theory and
   interactivity theory-predict that different antecedents (e.g., the
   number of clicks, response time, message type) are important. The
   results of Experiment 1 indicate that message type (i.e., how personal a
   particular message is) is the strongest predictor of interactivity
   perceptions. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the effects of
   message type on perceived interactivity and Web site effectiveness are
   greater when consumers are complaining than when they are inquiring
   about services. The results of Experiment 2 show that as the level of
   message personalization increases, interactivity perceptions and site
   effectiveness are enhanced (linear relationship). The authors discuss
   the implications of the findings for theory and practice and provide
   directions for measuring and manipulating interactivity in further

   three different facets of firm performance: normal profits, economic
   rents, and total firm risk. They argue that each of these metrics is of
   independent interest to shareholders and managers and that examining one
   without the others results in an incomplete picture of the true
   financial value of innovation. Using data on more than 20,000 new
   products from consumer packaged goods industries, the authors find that
   breakthrough innovation is associated with increases in both normal
   profits and economic rents and that, on average, each breakthrough
   innovation in the sample is associated with an increase in firm value of
   $4.2 million. Breakthrough innovation is also associated with increases
   in the risk of the innovating firm, but this higher risk is offset by
   above-normal stock returns. In contrast, incremental innovation is
   associated with increases in normal profits only and has no impact on
   economic rents or firm risk.

   firms are more successful than larger firms, and firms entering more

   is greater with earlier entry, greater control of entry mode, and
   shorter cultural and economic distances between the home and the host

   search-engine referrals and e-mails. The analysis suggests several
   managerial implications. Managers should focus their price promotions on
   stimulating new monthly subscriptions, rather than the current
   promotional focus on stimulating new yearly contracts. In contrast,
   e-mail and search-engine referrals appear to be effective at generating
   yearly subscriptions. Meanwhile, free-to-fee conversion e-mail blasts
   are a double-edged sword; they increase subscription revenue at the
   expense of advertising revenue. Finally, further analysis shows that the
   move was preceded by the buildup of momentum in new free subscriptions,
   which appears to be beneficial for the move's success. The decomposition
   and comparison of the sources of revenue loss versus gains reveals
   several trade-offs facing companies moving from free to free and fee.

AB The literature suggests that mangers are overly competitive and
   overemphasize competitors' payoffs in making decisions. The authors
   demonstrate how two seemingly innocuous but common decision inputs that
   mid- and entry-level managers use-(1) advice from colleagues and (2)
   training-could propagate this bias. The authors conduct an experiment in
   which one generation of participants plays a noncooperative game and
   then passes on advice on how to play the same game to the second
   generation. The authors find that the second generation is more likely
   to accept decisions that negatively impact the competitor's profits,
   even when those decisions result in lower payoffs. The results suggest
   that the advice of the first generation causes the second generation to
   be more sensitive to relative performance. In a second experiment, the
   authors show that training films that create negative feelings toward
   competitors can have adverse effects on managers' decisions. The
   training increases the willingness of managers to sacrifice own profits
   to reduce competitor profitability. These findings have important
   implications for managers in competitive markets. This research suggests
   that standard training materials that emphasize beating competitors
   should be carefully assessed for their unintentional but potentially
   damaging effects. In particular, training designed to evoke affective
   responses toward competitors must be used judiciously. Firms that give
   junior managers more autonomy and responsibility should also be
   cognizant that the advice these managers get and the information they
   share may propagate a competitive bias. To mitigate this problem, an
   option is to devote resources to better understand the content and
   nature of advice that managers share with one another.

AB What is the relationship between product design benefits (hedonic versus
   utilitarian) and the postconsumption feelings of customer delight and
   satisfaction? The primary insights this research provides are as
   follows: (1) Products that meet or exceed customers' utilitarian needs
   and fulfill prevention goals enhance customer satisfaction (e.g., a car
   with antilock brakes and vehicle stability assist), and (2) products
   that meet or exceed customers' hedonic wants and fulfill promotion goals
   enhance customer delight (e.g., a car with panoramic sunroof and
   six-speaker audio system). Furthermore, the research finds that the
   primary antecedent feelings of satisfaction are the prevention emotions
   of confidence and security provided by utilitarian benefits, whereas the
   primary antecedent feelings of delight are the promotion emotions of
   cheerfulness and excitement provided by hedonic benefits. Finally, the
   results show that delighting customers improves customer loyalty, as
   measured by word of mouth and repurchase intentions, more than merely
   satisfying them. The authors discuss the theoretical contribution and
   strategic insights the research provides for product designers and
   marketers.

   use of five holistic types: massive, contrasting, natural, delicate, and

   exciting brands should have contrasting designs, competent brands should
   have delicate designs, sophisticated brands should have natural or

AB Recently, academics have shown interest and enthusiasm in the
   development and implementation of stochastic customer base analysis
   models, such as the Pareto/NBD model and the BG/NBD model. Using the
   information these models provide, customer managers should be able to
   (1) distinguish active customers from inactive customers, (2) generate
   transaction forecasts for individual customers and determine future best
   customers, and (3) predict the purchase volume of the entire customer
   base. However, there is also a growing frustration among academics
   insofar as these models have not found their way into wide managerial
   application. To present arguments in favor of or against the use of
   these models in practice, the authors compare the quality of these
   models when applied to managerial decision making with the simple
   heuristics that firms typically use. The authors find that the simple
   heuristics perform at least as well as the stochastic models with regard
   to all managerially relevant areas, except for predictions regarding
   future purchases at the overall customer base level. The authors
   conclude that in their current state, stochastic customer base analysis
   models should be implemented in managerial practice with much care.
   Furthermore, they identify areas for improvement to make these models
   managerially more useful.

AB Radical product innovations are often agents of creative destruction.
   They threaten to destroy existing market positions, and yet they often
   yield vast new market opportunities. This article examines how
   competitors respond to the introduction of radical product innovations.
   The authors argue that competitive response to radical product
   innovations is inherently different from response to the incremental
   innovations that are typically studied in existing research. They
   introduce the dual concepts of market expansion and entry thresholds to
   develop new hypotheses about competitive response. Some of these
   hypotheses contradict prior literature. Using objective data from the
   U.S. pharmaceutical industry between 1997 and 2001, they estimate a
   shared-frailty hazard model to explain the competitive response to
   radical product innovations. The results show that the likelihood of
   competitive response is substantially higher when the introducing firm
   is large or market dependent. Moreover, the response is highest when the
   innovation is introduced in a small market by a large firm. These
   results contradict those from much prior research on competitive
   response to product innovation.

   equity. However, creating linkages between brands may also make them
   vulnerable to negative spillover. This research investigates the
   structure of relatedness in a brand portfolio to understand the nature
   of spillover effects. The results of two experiments show that the
   magnitude of spillover between brands is a function of not only the
   strength of brand associations but also their directionality. The
   results also show that the directional strength of association is
   influenced by the number and salience of associations linked to each

AB Empirical studies reveal a surprisingly wide variety of pricing
   strategies among retailers, even among Internet sellers of
   undifferentiated homogeneous goods, such as books and music CDs. Several
   empirical findings remain puzzling; for example, within the same market,
   some small retailers decide to discount deeply, whereas others forgo the
   price-sensitive switchers and price high. The authors present
   theoretical and empirical analyses that address these varied pricing
   strategies. A model of three asymmetric firms shows that under multiple
   switcher segments, in which different switchers compare prices at
   different retailers, firm-specific loyalty is not sufficient to explain
   the variety of pricing strategies. The authors demonstrate that a
   retailer's strategy to discount deeply or frequently is driven by the
   ratio of the size of switcher segments for which the retailer competes
   to its loyal segment size. The relative switcher-to-loyal ratios among
   retailers explain situations in which a small retailer finds it optimal
   to price high, despite having few loyals, or to discount and go for the
   switchers. The results of two empirical studies confirm the model's
   predictions for varied pricing strategies in the context of Internet
   booksellers. The analyses also present several implications. A small
   retailer can sometimes benefit from strategically limiting its access to
   switchers to soften price competition. A midsized retailer can benefit
   from targeting its switcher acquisition activities toward its larger
   rival, given the shallower discounts involved. When most switchers
   widely compare prices, a large retailer should offer few shallow
   discounts because other firms will more aggressively discount. The
   importance of switcher segmentation suggests that managers should
   carefully measure switching behavior in devising pricing strategies.

AB Guanxi refers to the durable social connections and networks a firm uses
   to exchange favors for organizational purposes. This study examines how
   and when guanxi operates as a governance mechanism that influences firm
   marketing competence and performance in the transitional economy of
   China. Drawing on social capital theory, the authors propose an
   integrative framework that unbundles the benefits and risks of guanxi
   and delineates the organizational processes to internalize guanxi as a
   corporate core competence. The authors surveyed senior executives in 282
   firms in China's consumer products industries. The findings confirm
   guanxi's direct effects on market performance and its indirect effects
   mediated through channel capability and responsive capability. The
   authors also confirm that technological turbulence and competition
   intensity can be effective structure-loosening forces, thus reducing the
   governance effects of guanxi. The findings suggest that firms can
   improve market access and growth through guanxi networks, but managers
   need to capitalize on them from the personal to the corporate level. In
   addition, managers should be aware of guanxi's dark sides, which include
   reciprocal obligations and collective blindness. This study shows that
   personal networks are popular universally, but in China, they have
   unique, distinct ways of operation.

AB This article examines rewards to product introduction by new ventures.
   The authors argue that the new ventures that gain the most from
   innovation are those that adopt strategies that give them legitimacy in
   the eyes of stakeholders. New ventures can gain legitimacy by creating
   associations with established entities; such associations can be
   internal or external to the firm. The authors test these ideas by
   examining the stock market gains of all products introduced between 1982
   and 2002 by all public firms in the U.S. biotechnology industry. The
   results show that new ventures that acquire legitimacy externally by
   forming alliances with established firms gain more from their new
   products than new ventures that do not form such alliances. Among new
   ventures that do not form alliances, those that acquire legitimacy
   internally by creating a history of product launches or by hiring
   reputed executives or scientists gain more from their new products than
   those that do not. In relative terms, it pays more to have introduced a
   new drug before than to have a reputed executive on the firm's board; in
   turn, adding a reputed executive pays more than adding a reputed
   scientist to the firm's board. Finally, although new ventures can gain
   from either external or internal legitimacy, pursuit of external
   legitimacy by firms that already have internal legitimacy leads to lower
   rewards to innovation.

   quality (the caliber of relational ties), contact density (the number of

   but also from the number and decision-making capability of interfirm
   contacts and the interactions among relational drivers. Moderator
   analysis of customer characteristics suggests that increasing contact
   density benefits sellers that have customers with high employee turnover
   rates, whereas building relationships with key decisions makers
   generates the highest returns among customers that are more difficult to
   access. The conceptual model of the impact of interfirm relational
   drivers on customer value receives support from dyadic data across 446

AB Firm valuation has been an important domain of interest for finance.
   However, most financial models do not include customer-related metrics
   in this process. Studies in marketing have found that one particular
   customer metric, customer satisfaction, improves the ability to predict
   future cash flows, long-term financial measures, stock performance, and
   shareholder value. However, most of these studies predominantly employ
   models that are not directly used in finance practice. This article
   extends existing literature by examining the impact of customer
   satisfaction on firm valuation by employing multiples and risk-adjusted
   abnormal return models borrowed directly from the practice of finance.
   Data include 3600 firm-quarter observations from the American Customer
   Satisfaction Index, COMPUSTAT, and Center for Research in Securities
   Prices databases from 1996 to 2006. The results indicate that a
   portfolio of stocks consisting of firms with high levels and positive
   changes in customer satisfaction will outperform the other three
   possible portfolio combinations (low levels and negative changes, low
   levels and positive changes, and high levels and negative changes in
   customer satisfaction) along with Standard & Poor's 500. Initially, the
   stock market undervalues positive satisfaction information, but the

AB In business markets, the long-term nature of relationships may prompt

   (CIs) can cause a destabilization of these long-term relationships. The
   authors develop a comprehensive dynamic model of customer loyalty to
   account for the impact of negative CIs on both the nature and the
   magnitude of the relationships between satisfaction and customer share.
   The results indicate that CIs trigger a stronger updating of the
   customer relationship, which moves customers from a business-as-usual

AB The authors investigate the effectiveness of service transition
   strategies for generating shareholder value by evaluating secondary data
   pertaining to 477 publicly traded manufacturing firms during 1990-2005.
   The impact of a firm's transition to services on firm value (as measured
   by Tobin's q) remains relatively flat or slightly negative until the
   firm reaches a critical mass of service sales (20%-30%), after which
   point they have an increasingly positive effect. Furthermore, the effect
   of service sales on firm value depends on both firm and industry
   factors. Service transition strategies are more effective at enhancing
   value when the service offerings are related more to the firm's core
   business and when firms have more available resources (i.e., resource
   slack). The impact of adding services to core products on firm value
   amplifies as industry turbulence increases but diminishes when the
   firm's core products are in high-growth industries.

AB Identifying market evolution is a necessary step in persistence analysis
   of marketing input-output relationships. Using the advertising-sales
   relationship to represent general marketing input-output dynamics, the
   authors theoretically distinguish two types of market evolution: (1)
   intrinsic evolution, in which sales evolve independent of advertising
   and temporary advertising can generate persistent effects, and (2)
   induced evolution, in which sales evolution is supported by sustained
   advertising budgets in an intrinsic-stationary market and there are no
   real persistent effects of temporary advertising. The proposed intrinsic
   market evolution test can identify intrinsic-evolving and
   intrinsic-stationary markets. The authors analyze five major budgeting
   implications and provide methods to quantify temporary and sustained
   budgeting. In general, in an intrinsic-evolving market, budgeting can be
   short-term focused, whereas in an intrinsic-stationary market, the focus
   should be on sustained budgeting. Percentage budgeting at a sufficient
   level can create induced evolution. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
   temporary, intensive advertising campaigns are often not necessary.
   Empirical illustrations demonstrate the two types of evolutions and the
   relationships between budgeting methods and sales performance.

AB Since the 1960s, scientific academic research has played a prominent
   role in most leading business schools. Recently, however, critics have
   argued that emphasizing research is misguided and may only serve the
   faculty's interests at the expense of students and the firms that employ
   them. This study attempts to inform this debate by investigating the
   short- and long-term effects of academic research in 57 business schools
   over 18 years on academics', recruiters', and applicants' perceptions as
   well as on the schools' education performance with current students. The
   authors find that academic research has positive long-term effects on
   the perceptions of these three constituents and on education
   performance, as well as short-term effects on academics' perceptions.
   Moreover, effect sizes are large and meaningful. A persistent increase
   of three single-author articles per year is associated with an
   improvement in a school's ranking among academics by one place, a
   decline in its acceptance rate of 1%, and an increase in graduates'
   average annual starting salary of more than $750. The authors discuss
   the implications of these findings and present related opportunities for
   further research.

AB Through field experiments conducted in two business-to-business firms,
   the authors evaluate the financial and relational consequences of
   adopting a customer focus in sales campaigns. In both the experiments,
   salespeople adopting the customer-focused sales campaign coordinated
   their sales calls with the objective of selling all the products that a
   customer was predicted to purchase only at the time the customer was
   expected to purchase. The authors compare this strategy with the current
   practice in the organization in which salespeople for each product
   category independently contacted the customers who were expected to
   purchase in that category without any guidance on the expected timing of
   customer purchase. The experiments show that adopting a customer-focused
   sales campaign can significantly increase firm profits and return on
   investment. The total incremental profits obtained from implementing the
   customer-focused sales campaign was more than $1 million. High-revenue
   customers were the source of improvements in the efficiency of marketing
   contacts, whereas low-revenue customers were the source of improvements
   in the effectiveness of the marketing contacts. A customer-focused sales
   campaign also improved the relationship quality between the customer and
   the firm. This research provides empirical evidence for theoretical
   expectations of the benefits provided by a customer-focused sales
   campaign. Organizations can use the field experiments illustrated in

AB When targeting bilingual consumers, advertisers have a choice to
   advertise in a bilingual's native language or in the country's dominant
   language. Within the Hispanic community in the United States, for
   example, Kellogg has a choice to advertise Frosted Flakes in English or
   in Spanish. But which is the better choice and why? This research
   considers whether the choice of language in advertising to bilinguals
   influences the types of thoughts they have in response to an
   advertisement. In other words, for a bilingual, can the exact same
   selling message cue different associations depending on the language in
   which it is presented? The underlying issue is whether advertisers can
   use language of execution as a strategic variable with which to generate
   certain types of associations that may facilitate persuasion. The
   authors consider this issue from a social cognition perspective. They
   hypothesize that a native-language advertisement is more likely to
   elicit self-referent thoughts about family, friends, home, or homeland,
   which in turn may lead to more positive attitude measures and behavioral
   intentions. Furthermore, the authors show that these effects are
   moderated by the consumption context presented in the advertisement.

AB This study introduces the concept of flow signals-patterns of a firm's
   attributes over time-and contrasts them with point signals discussed in
   the literature to date. Three properties of flow signals are delineated:
   displacement, propensity, and reversals. The authors illustrate these
   properties using a start-up's research-and-development (R&D) spending
   and voluntary disclosure flows. The authors argue that the flow signal
   properties affect prospective customers' perceptions of a start-up's
   current and future product quality, thus influencing their purchase
   likelihood and, ultimately, the start-up's growth in sales. The
   findings, obtained from panel data comprised of U.S. venture-backed
   firms that went public in 2001-2005, suggest that sales growth is
   positively affected by displacement and propensity of both R&D spending
   and voluntary disclosures and negatively affected by R&D spending
   reversals. Furthermore, these effects are stronger for the relatively
   younger start-ups.

AB This article examines the role of marketing in the context of initial
   public offerings (IPOs), a neglected issue in the extant literature. The
   results from a large-scale, cross-industry study indicate that firms'
   pre-IPO marketing spendings help reduce IPO underpricing and boost IPO
   trading in the stock market. The econometric models also suggest that
   these effects are heterogeneous; that is, they are more salient for
   firms with higher cost reduction efficiency and in markets with a
   smaller number of historical IPOs. With regard to theory, this research
   ushers in a greenfield of IPOs, helping build more powerful theories of
   market-based assets and customer equity. With regard to practice, it
   builds the case for not cutting marketing before an IPO. Prudent
   investors may be better able to pick "star" IPOs if they can track
   pre-IPO marketing spendings and model firm cost reduction efficiency
   simultaneously. Overall, this article offers fresh implications for the
   marketing-finance interface, uncovering brand-new IPO-based reasons that
   marketing can help create shareholder value.

AB It seems to be common sense that to increase profits, firms should
   prioritize customers (i.e., focus their efforts on the most important
   customers). However, such a strategy might have substantial negative
   effects on firms' relationships with customers treated at a low priority
   level. Prior research does not indicate satisfactorily whether and how
   customer prioritization pays off. Moreover, although customer
   prioritization may be strongly present in firms' marketing strategies,
   firms frequently fail to implement such a strategy. Therefore, it is
   also important to investigate empirically by which means firms can
   facilitate implementation. The authors address both issues and conduct a
   cross-industry study with 310 firms from business-to-consumer and
   business-to-business contexts together with two independent validation
   samples. The results show that customer prioritization ultimately leads
   to higher average customer profitability and a higher return on sales
   because it (1) affects relationships with top-tier customers positively
   but does not affect relationships with bottom-tier customers and (2)
   reduces marketing and sales costs. Furthermore, the ability to assess
   customer profitability, the quality of customer information, selective
   organizational alignment, selective senior-level involvement, and
   selective elaboration of planning and control all positively moderate
   the link between a firm's prioritization strategy and actual customer
   prioritization.

AB This article focuses on how the customer portfolios of technology-based
   entrepreneurial firm,,; affect new product development. Drawing on
   knowledge-based, resource dependence, and relational theories, the
   authors argue that the impact of a firm's customers on new product
   development depends on the size and relational embeddedness of the
   customer portfolio and the extent to which the firm is dependent on one
   or a few dominant customers for a majority of its revenues. The authors
   test the research model using longitudinal data on young firms operating
   in business-to-business markets in six technology-based industries. The
   results indicate that customer portfolio size has an inverse U-shaped
   relationship to the number of new products developed and that the more
   relationally embedded the customer set, the more new products the firm
   develops. Dependence stemming from revenue concentration has a negative
   impact on new product output. Furthermore, the authors find that
   relational embeddedness can compensate for too small of a customer
   portfolio and can help offset the negative effects of a highly
   concentrated portfolio. These results make important theoretical and
   empirical contributions to the new product development literature,
   helping uncover some of the antecedents of innovative productivity
   particularly relevant for young, technology-based firms. The results
   also contribute to the broader discourse on how customers affect new
   product development.

AB The authors build on conceptual and analytic evidence to argue that
   firms can increase performance by shifting emphasis away from customer
   retention strategies toward customer acquisition strategies as
   competitive density (i.e., the number of competitors) increases and the
   marketplace becomes more dynamic. Empirical research using four data
   sources for a single artistic industry produces strong support for the
   moderation hypotheses. When competitive density is low, a customer
   retention strategy emphasizing close relationships with customers and
   adaptive learning enhances performance. When competitive density is
   high, a customer acquisition strategy emphasizing innovation and
   competitor learning enhances performance. Four key takeaways emerge. As
   competitive density increases, (1) the financial impact of choosing the
   right mix of resources and capabilities increases; (2) close customer
   relationships become liabilities, providing no revenue benefits and
   exerting a negative effect on net income; (3) close relationships with
   suppliers increase revenues but also expenses, so that net income
   decreases; and (4) adaptive learning lowers revenue and, even more so,
   expenses, so that net income increases. The authors discuss the
   implications of these findings and identify combinations of resources
   and capabilities that achieve different performance objectives.

   household's private-label (PL) share and its behavioral store loyalty.
   The model includes major drivers of these two behaviors and controls for
   simultaneity and nonlinearity in the relationship between them. The
   model is estimated with a unique data set that combines complete
   purchase records of a panel of Dutch households with demographic and
   psychographic data. The authors estimate the model for two retail chains
   in the Netherlands-the leading service chain with a well-differentiated
   high-share PL and the leading value chain with a lower-share PL. They
   find that PL share significantly affects all three measures of
   behavioral loyalty in the study: share of wallet, share of items
   purchased, and share of shopping trips. In addition, behavioral loyalty
   has a significant effect on PL share. For the service chain, the authors
   find that both effects are in the form of an inverted U. For the value
   chain, the effects are positive and nonlinear, but they do not exhibit
   nonmonotonicity, because PL share has not yet reached high enough
   levels. The managerial implications of this research are important.
   Retailers can reap the benefits of a virtuous cycle; greater PL share
   increases share of wallet, and greater share of wallet increases PL
   share. However, this virtuous cycle operates only to a point because
   heavy PL buyers tend to be loyal to price savings and PLs in general,
   not to the PL of any particular chain.

   psychology, the authors conduct two eye-tracker studies that show how
   fast-forwarding viewers pay more attention during commercials, but their
   attention is heavily limited to the center of the screen. Fast-forwarded
   advertisements containing brand information at screen center still
   create brand memory even with a 95% reduction in frames and complete
   loss of audio, whereas advertisements with brand information located

   information can positively affect brand attitude, behavioral intent, and

   counteract the negative effects of digital video recorders by ensuring

AB In mergers and acquisitions (M&As), brands account for significant but
   heterogeneous proportions of overall transaction value. The marketing
   literature focuses on the drivers of financial value of brands when
   there is no change in the ownership of brands. However, in M&As, the
   value of brands also depends on how their new owners leverage them. This
   study identifies both the target and the acquirer firm characteristics
   that affect the value of a target firm's brands in M&As. The study uses
   audited measures of acquired brand value from Securities and Exchange
   Commission filings (made available as a result of recent statutory
   reporting requirements) along with data collected from diverse secondary
   sources. The empirical test of the model is based on 133 M&A
   transactions in which acquirers attribute value to target firms' brands.
   The results indicate that acquirer and target marketing capabilities and
   brand portfolio diversity have positive effects on a target firm's brand
   value. The positive impact of acquirer brand portfolio diversity and
   target marketing capability is lower when the M&A is synergistic than
   when it is nonsynergistic. The findings are robust to various model
   specifications, measures, endogeneity, and sample selection.

AB Brand communities have been cited for their potential not only to
   enhance the loyalty of members but also to engender a sense of
   oppositional loyalty toward competing brands. However, the impact of
   brand community membership on actual new product adoption behavior has
   yet to be explored. This study examines the effects of brand community
   participation and membership duration on the adoption of new products
   from opposing brands as well as from the preferred brand. Longitudinal
   data were collected on the participation behavior, membership duration,
   and adoption behavior of 7506 members spanning four brand communities
   and two product categories. Using a hazard modeling approach, the
   authors find that higher levels of participation and longer-term
   membership in a brand community not only increase the likelihood of
   adopting a new product from the preferred brand but also decrease the
   likelihood of adopting new products from opposing brands. However, such
   oppositional loyalty is contingent on whether a competitor's new product
   is the first to market. Furthermore, in the case of overlapping
   memberships, higher levels of participation in a brand community may
   actually increase the likelihood of adopting products from rival brands.
   This finding is both surprising and disconcerting because marketing
   managers usually do not know which other memberships their brand
   community members possess. The authors discuss how managers can enhance
   the impact of their brand community on the adoption of the company's new
   products while limiting the impact of opposing brand communities.

   products advertised by second-party advertisers. However, a positive
   reputation insulates second-party firms from these carryover effects,
   provided that this reputation is based on an endorsement from an

   explanation for the misleading claim prove to be effective in avoiding
   the negative side effects of correction. These findings add to the
   correction literature by (1) showing that this form of regulation can
   have much broader side effects than demonstrated previously, (2)
   identifying distrust as the mechanism by which these effects occur, and
   (3) suggesting strategies to protect firms from the negative side
   effects of correction. The findings also support the defensive consumer

AB Research on linking operational marketing inputs to customer attitudes
   and customer behavior has been gaining significance concomitant with the
   growing recognition that customers are market-based assets. In response
   to this, researchers and practitioners have proposed several conceptual
   models. Despite recent advances in research, the results are still
   inconclusive as to the relationship between customer attitude and future
   sales. A reason for this could be due to the paucity of studies
   combining survey-based data with behavioral data to understand better
   the drivers of customer behavior. With that in mind, the authors
   investigate the effects of customer perceptions of key marketing actions
   on customer attitudes and actual customer behavior as reflected by
   future sales. The authors propose that customer perceptions of value,
   brand, and relationship-"customer equity drivers"-affect loyalty
   intentions and future sales. The results of the study, which is based on
   a sample of 5694 customers of a large European do-it-yourself retailer,
   suggest that customer equity drivers can significantly predict future
   sales, even after the authors control for the current sales level.

AB All types of consumer expenditures ultimately vie for the same pool of
   limited resources-the consumer's discretionary income. Consequently,
   consumers' spending in a particular industry can be better understood in
   relation to their expenditures in others. Although marketers may believe
   that they are operating in distinct and unrelated industries, it is
   important to understand how consumers, with a given budget, make
   trade-offs between meeting different consumption needs. For example, how
   much would escalating gas prices affect consumer spending on food and
   apparel? Which industries would gain most in terms of extra consumer
   spending as a result of a tax rebate? Answers to these questions are
   also important from a public policy standpoint because they provide
   insights into how consumer welfare would be affected as consumers
   reallocate their consumption budget in response to environmental
   changes. This study proposes a structural demand model to approximate
   the household budget allocation decision, in which consumers are assumed
   to allocate a given budget across a full spectrum of consumption
   categories to maximize an underlying utility function. The authors
   illustrate the model using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from the
   United States, covering 31 consumption categories over 22 years. The
   calibrated model makes it possible to draw direct inferences about the
   trade-offs individual households make when they face budget constraints
   and how their relative preferences for different consumption categories
   vary across life stages and income levels. The study also demonstrates
   how the proposed model can be used in policy simulations to quantify the
   potential impacts on consumption patterns due to shifts in prices or
   discretionary income.

AB Although cross-functional integration is often considered an important
   element in a successful new product development program, a great deal of
   variance exists in extant literature regarding how integration is
   defined and implemented and how relevant studies are conducted. The
   authors attempt to bring clarity to a diverse set of 25 studies that
   investigate cross-functional integration by empirically analyzing 146
   correlations between integration and aspects of new product success. The
   authors examine the impact of 12 potential moderators that affect the
   integration-success link using meta-analysis techniques. The findings
   indicate that though cross-functional integration may indeed have a
   direct impact on success, the combination of integration with other
   variables may be of greater importance. Furthermore, because most of the
   nine variables that significantly affect the integration-success
   relationship are either managerially controlled or industry specific,
   the findings imply that firms should design cross-functional structures
   to maximize their effectiveness. Other variables that affect the
   integration-success relationship reflect researchers' methodological
   decisions, suggesting that care should be taken when designing and
   interpreting the results of such studies. The authors discuss the
   implications of these findings and directions for further research.

AB Radical innovation is an important driver of the growth, success, and
   wealth of firms and nations. Because of its importance, authors across
   various disciplines have proposed many theories about the drivers of
   such innovation, including government policy and labor, capital, and
   culture at the national level. The authors contrast these theories with
   one based on the corporate culture of the firm. They test their theory
   using survey and archival data from 759 firms across 17 major economies
   of the world. The results suggest the following: First, among the
   factors studied, corporate culture is the strongest driver of radical
   innovation across nations; culture consists of three attitudes and three
   practices. Second, the commercialization of radical innovations
   translates into a firm's financial performance; it is a stronger
   predictor of financial performance than other popular measures, such as
   patents. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for
   research and practice.

AB Under increased scrutiny from top management and shareholders, marketing
   managers feel the need to measure and communicate the impact of their
   actions on shareholder returns. In particular, how do customer value
   creation (through product innovation) and customer value communication
   (through marketing investments) affect stock returns? This article
   examines, conceptually and empirically, how product innovations and
   marketing investments for such product innovations lift stock returns by
   improving the outlook on future cash flows. The authors address these
   questions with a large-scale econometric analysis of product innovation
   and associated marketing mix in the automobile industry. They find that
   adding such marketing actions to the established finance benchmark model
   greatly improves the explained variance in stock returns. In particular,
   investors react favorably to companies that launch pioneering
   innovations, that have higher perceived quality, that are backed by
   substantial advertising support, and that are in large and growing
   categories. Finally, the authors quantify and compare the stock return
   benefits of several managerial control variables. The results highlight
   the stock market benefits of pioneering innovations. Compared with minor
   updates, pioneering innovations have an impact on stock returns that is
   seven times greater, and their advertising support is nine times more
   effective as well. Perceived quality of the new car introduction
   improves the firm's stock returns, but customer liking does not have a
   statistically significant effect. Promotional incentives have a negative
   effect on stock returns, indicating that price promotions may be
   interpreted as a signal of demand weakness. Managers can combine these
   return estimates with internal data on project costs to help decide the
   appropriate mix of product innovation and marketing investment.

AB Pay what you want (PWYW) is a new participative pricing mechanism in
   which consumers have maximum control over the price they pay. Previous
   research has suggested that participative pricing increases consumers'
   intent to purchase. However, sellers using PWYW face the risk that
   consumers will exploit their control and pay nothing at all or a price
   below the seller's costs. In three field studies, the authors find that
   prices paid are significantly greater than zero. They analyze factors
   that influence prices paid and show that PWYW can even lead to an
   increase in seller revenues.

AB Most large firms operating in consumer markets own and market more than
   one brand (i.e., they have a brand portfolio). Although firms make
   corporate-level strategic decisions regarding their brand portfolio,
   little is known about whether and how a firm's brand portfolio strategy
   is linked to its business performance. Using data from the American
   Customer Satisfaction Index and other secondary sources, the authors
   examine the impact of the scope, competition, and positioning
   characteristics of brand portfolios on the marketing and financial
   performance of 72 large publicly traded firms operating in consumer
   markets over ten years (from 1994 to 2003). Controlling for several
   industry and firm characteristics, the authors analyze the relationship
   between five specific brand portfolio characteristics (number of brands
   owned, number of segments in which they are marketed, degree to which
   the brands in the firm's portfolio compete with one another, and
   consumer perceptions of the quality and price of the brands in the
   firm's portfolio) and firms' marketing effectiveness (consumer loyalty
   and market share), marketing efficiency (ratio of advertising spending
   to sales and ratio of selling, general, and administrative expenses to
   sales), and financial performance (Tobin's q, cash flow, and cash flow
   variability). They find that each of these five brand portfolio
   characteristics explains significant variance in five or more of the
   seven aspects of firms' marketing and financial performance examined.

AB Internet auction companies have developed innovative tools that enable
   sellers to reveal more information about their credibility and product
   quality to avoid the "lemons" problem. On the basis of signaling and
   auction theories, the authors propose a typology of Internet auction
   quality and credibility indicators, adopt and modify Park and Bradlow's
   (2005) model, and use eBay as an example to examine empirically how
   different types of indicators help alleviate uncertainty. This empirical
   evidence demonstrates how Internet auction features affect consumer
   participation and bidding decisions, what modifies the credibility of
   quality indicators, and how different buyers react to indicators. The
   signaling-based hypotheses provide coherent explanations of consumers'
   bidding behavior. As the first empirical study to evaluate the signaling
   role of comprehensive Internet auction institutional features in
   mitigating the adverse selection problem, this research provides
   evidence to clarify the economic foundation behind innovative Internet
   auction designs.

AB Loyalty programs have become an important component of firms'
   relationship management strategies. There are now some industries in
   which numerous rival loyalty programs are offered, inducing intense
   competition among these programs. However, existing research on loyalty
   programs has often studied such programs in a noncompetitive setting and
   has often focused on a single program in isolation. Addressing this gap,
   this research examines the effect of a firm's competitive positioning
   and market saturation on the performance of the firm's loyalty program.
   Based on the analysis of firm- and individual-level data from the
   airline industry, the results indicate that larger firms tend to benefit
   more from their loyalty program offerings than smaller firms. Moreover,
   when the product category demand is rigid, the impact of an individual
   loyalty program decreases as the marketplace becomes more saturated with
   competing programs. However, when the product category is highly
   expandable, the saturation effect disappears. Under such situations,
   loyalty programs can help an industry gain competitive advantage over
   substitute offerings outside the industry, and multiple programs can
   effectively coexist even under a high level of market saturation.

AB The objective of this article is to examine the impact of a new

   store visitation as a measure of online search and decompose a shopper's
   tendency to search a given Web site into a baseline search preference
   for that site and an inertial effect of visiting that site. They find
   that inertia is an important driver in search behavior and is easily
   disrupted by a new competitive entry. This is a new and significant
   finding that contributes to the competitive entry literature. The
   authors develop a Bayesian model of search that separates the role of
   baseline search preference and inertia on store visitation and captures
   the effect of a new competitive entry. They apply this model to Internet

   Although increased emphasis has been placed on publication productivity

   as (1) What level of publication productivity in the leading marketing
   journals does it take to get promoted in marketing academia? (2) What
   level of publication productivity in the leading marketing journals

   imperfect substitution to address these questions using two data sets:
   (1) a census of publication activity in the leading marketing journals
   of 337 scholars in the top 70 institutions who were promoted between
   1992 and 2006 and (2) an examination of 2672 scholars who published 3492
   articles in the four leading marketing journals over the 1982-2006
   period. The results indicate that the average number of publications by

   marketing journals per year, compared with .47 in the top 11-20

AB Manufacturing firms seek continuous supplier performance improvement
   because this outcome makes them more competitive in downstream markets.
   Although manufacturing firms use a range of tools to effect continuous

   especially important-collaborative communication and control-and poses
   the following research questions: (1) How does collaborative
   communication foster continuous supplier performance improvement? and
   (2) What are the combined effects of collaborative communication and
   control? The results from a survey of 153 manufacturer-supplier dyads
   show that collaborative communication fosters continuous supplier
   performance improvement by enhancing supplier knowledge (of manufacturer
   needs) and by building supplier affective commitment (toward the
   manufacturer). With respect to the combined effects of communication and
   control, the results show that capability control enhances the positive
   effects of both supplier knowledge and supplier affective commitment on
   continuous supplier performance improvement, whereas process control
   undermines the effect of supplier knowledge on the outcome. This pattern
   of results suggests that manufacturing firms should emphasize capability
   control and deemphasize process control to foster continuous supplier
   performance improvement.

   that includes data from employees, customers, and firms, the authors
   find strong support for the extended SPC, which accounts for important

AB By lowering the costs of gathering and sharing information and offering
   new ways to learn about products before purchase, the Internet reduces
   traditional distinctions between search and experience goods. At the
   same time, differences in the type of information sought for search and
   experience goods can precipitate differences in the process through
   which consumers gather information and make decisions online. A
   preliminary experiment shows that though there are significant
   differences in consumers' perceived ability to evaluate product quality
   before purchase between search and experience goods in traditional
   retail environments, these differences are blurred in online
   environments. An analysis of the online behavior of a representative
   sample of U.S. consumers shows that consumers spend similar amounts of
   time online gathering information for both search and experience goods,
   but there are important differences in the browsing and purchase
   behavior of consumers for these two types of goods. In particular,
   experience goods involve greater depth (time per page) and lower breadth
   (total number of pages) of search than search goods. In addition, free
   riding (purchasing from a retailer other than the primary source of
   product information) is less frequent for experience than for search
   goods. Finally, the presence of product reviews from other consumers and
   multimedia that enable consumers to interact with products before

AB Proactive postsales service (PPS) refers to a supplier taking the
   initiative to contact a customer to provide service after a sale is
   complete. It is argued that PIPS leads to faster delivery of service to
   a broader cross-section of customers than customer-initiated postsales
   service, or reactive postsales service. The authors argue that mental
   frames of customers and suppliers engaged in PIPS are more positive and
   open than mental frames of those engaged in customer-initiated service.
   On the basis of nine focus groups with 94 managers in both
   business-to-business and business-to-consumer settings, the authors
   propose three main dimensions of PIPS: (1) proactive prevention, (2)
   proactive education, and (3) proactive feedback seeking. They argue that
   PIPS leads not only to favorable customer-level outcomes (e.g., customer
   satisfaction) but also to favorable supplier-level outcomes (e.g.,
   greater innovativeness, new product success rate). The authors propose
   that the value of PIPS varies depending on the product's life-cycle
   stage, its transaction extensiveness, and network externality. In
   addition, the value of PIPS varies depending on a customer's usage
   intensity, openness to experience, and market mavenism. Some key
   challenges with PPS pertain to implementation issues, such as privacy
   intrusion, expectation escalation, user identification, and contact
   routinization. If neglected, these can result in PIPS leading to
   negative rather than positive outcomes. The authors develop guidelines
   for addressing these challenges and implementing PPS effectively in both
   business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts.

AB Systems are composed of complementary products (e.g., video game systems
   are composed of the video game console and video games). Prior
   literature on indirect network effects has argued that in system
   markets, sales of the primary product (often referred to as "hardware")
   largely depend on the availability of complementary products (often
   referred to as "software"). Mathematical and empirical analyses have
   almost exclusively operationalized software availability as software
   quantity. However, though not substantiated with empirical evidence,
   case illustrations show that certain high-quality, "superstar" software
   titles (e.g., Super Mario 64) may have disproportionately large effects
   on hardware unit sales (e.g., Nintendo N64 console sales). In the
   context of the U.S. home video game console market, the authors show
   that the introduction of a superstar increases video game console sales
   by an average of 14% (167,000 units) over a period of five months. One
   in every five buyers of a superstar software title also purchases the
   hardware required to use the software. Software type does not
   consistently alter this effect. The findings imply that scholars who
   study the relationship between software availability and hardware sales
   need to account for superstar returns and their decaying effect over
   time, beyond a mere software quantity effect. Hardware firms should
   maintain a steady flow of superstar introductions because the positive
   effect of a superstar lasts only five months and, if need be, make side
   payments to software firms because superstars dramatically increase
   hardware sales. Hardware firms' exclusivity over superstars does not
   provide an extra boost to their own sales, but it takes away an
   opportunity for competing systems to increase their sales.

AB This study addresses two important global trends: protection of public
   goods, specifically the environment, and the emergence of multiethnic
   societies with influential minority groups. The study tests the effect
   of a government proenvironmental demarketing campaign on the
   deconsumption behavior of minority groups and the majority population.
   It suggests that minority consumers use consumption or deconsumption to
   manifest their social identity, beliefs, and goals as minorities in
   relation to the majority and that their motivation to respond positively
   to a government's demarketing campaign is shaped by their national
   attachment levels. The study was conducted in Jerusalem, Israel, and
   involved a large data set (N = 66,272) containing household-level data
   on actual behavior of consumers. The studied groups involved the
   majority of non-ultra-Orthodox Jews and three minority groups: Israeli
   Arabs, ultra-Orthodox Jews, and Jewish Russian immigrants. The findings
   show that in a proenvironmental context, government demarketing is more
   effective on the majority group than on any of the three minority
   groups. In addition, minority groups with lower national attachment
   levels respond more negatively to the demarketing effort. However,
   higher education levels lead to a more positive response across the
   majority and minority groups. A central implication of the findings is
   related to the benefits derived from demarketing for different consumer
   groups (majorities versus minorities based on religion, ethnicity, and
   immigration status). The findings also provide a benchmark for
   demarketing efforts in an environmental context. Finally, they suggest
   that policy makers and marketers should consider using demarketing more
   to complement regulatory and economic tools.

AB There is little empirical research on internal marketing despite its
   intuitive appeal and anecdotal accounts of its benefits. Adopting a
   social identity theory perspective, the authors propose that internal
   marketing is fundamentally a process in which leaders instill into
   followers a sense of oneness with the organization, formally known as
   "organizational identification" (OI). The authors test the OI-transfer
   research model in two multinational studies using multilevel and
   multisource data. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses show that the
   OI-transfer process takes place in the relationships between business
   unit managers and salespeople and between regional directors and
   business unit managers. Furthermore, both leader-follower dyadic tenure
   and charismatic leadership moderate this cascading effect. Leaders with
   a mismatch between their charisma and 01 ultimately impair followers'
   OI. In turn, customer-contact employees' OI strongly predicts their
   sales performance. Finally, both employees' and sales managers' OI are
   positively related to their business units' financial performance. The
   study provides empirical evidence for the role of leaders, especially
   middle managers, in building member identification that lays the
   foundation for internal marketing.

AB This article reports on a marketing initiative at a pharmaceutical
   company to redesign its distribution network. Distribution affects a
   firm's cost and customer satisfaction and drives profitability. Using a
   nonlinear mixed-integer programming model, the authors develop a
   distribution network with a dual emphasis on minimizing the total
   distribution costs and improving the customer service levels.
   Specifically, they address the following issues: They (1) determine the
   optimal number of regional distribution centers the firm should operate
   with, (2) identify where in the United States the firm should locate
   these distribution centers, (3) allocate each retailer/customer
   distribution center to an appropriate regional distribution center, and
   (4) determine the total transportation costs and service level for each
   case. Finally, they conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the
   impact of changes in problem parameters on the optimality of the
   proposed model. This marketing initiative at the studied firm reduced
   the total distribution costs by $1.99 million (6%) per year, while
   increasing the customer on-time delivery from 61.41% to 86.2%, an
   improvement of 40.4%.

AB Consumer-generated communication processes have drawn increasing
   attention of marketers and researchers. However, an underresearched
   issue is that interpersonal communications are not always brand
   specific. Thus, a person can adopt a brand either as a result of
   communication with adopters of that brand (within-brand influence) or as
   a result of an interaction with adopters of competing brands
   (cross-brand influence). This study shows that the interplay between
   within- and cross-brand influence can have a substantial effect on the
   growth of markets under competition. The authors develop a model that
   explicitly represents these two influences and focus on the case of two
   otherwise identical competing brands with different entry times. As a
   result of within-brand influence, current customers create an
   interaction-based advantage for the first entrant, which grows with
   time. Thus, we illustrate how customers should be viewed as market
   assets who yield increasing returns during the diffusion process.
   Conversely, cross-brand influence enables a market follower to enjoy a
   shorter takeoff time. Given the combination of both, the authors predict
   the "dual pattern," characterized by a fast takeoff for a follower,
   followed by a widening gap in favor of the first entrant, all else being
   equal. They show that such a pattern dominated the market growth of the
   cellular industry in Western Europe. They explain the reasons behind
   this dual pattern, rule out straightforward alternative explanations,
   and discuss the managerial implications.

AB The firm-customer exchange process consists of three key parts: (1)
   firm-initiated marketing communications, (2) customer buying behavior,
   and (3) customer product return behavior. To date, the literature in
   marketing has largely focused on how marketing communications affect
   customer buying behavior and, to some extent, how past buying behavior
   affects a firm's decisions to initiate future marketing communications.
   However, the literature on product returns is sparse, especially in
   relation to analyzing individual customer product return behavior.
   Although the magnitude of the value of product returns is known to be
   high ($100 billion per year), how it affects customer buying behavior is
   not known because of a lack of data availability and understanding of
   the role of product returns in the firm-customer exchange process. Given
   that product returns are considered a hassle for a firm's supply chain
   management and a drain on overall profitability, it is important to
   study product return behavior. Thus, the authors empirically demonstrate
   the role of product returns in the exchange process by determining the
   exchange process factors that help explain product return behavior and
   the consequences of product returns on future customer and firm
   behavior. In addition, the authors demonstrate that product returns are
   inevitable but by no means evil.

AB Hierarchical loyalty programs award elevated customer status (e.g.,
   "elite membership") to consumers who meet a predefined spending level.
   However, if a customer subsequently falls short of the required spending
   level, firms commonly revoke that status. The authors investigate the
   impact of such customer demotion on loyalty intentions toward the firm.
   Building on prospect theory and emotions theory, the authors hypothesize
   that changes in customer status have an asymmetric negative effect, such
   that the negative impact of customer demotion is stronger than the
   positive impact of status increases. An experimental scenario study
   provides evidence that loyalty intentions are indeed lower for demoted
   customers than for those who have never been awarded a preferred status,
   meaning that hierarchical loyalty programs can drive otherwise loyal
   customers away from a firm. A field study using proprietary sales data
   from a different industry context demonstrates the robustness of the
   negative impact of customer demotion. The authors test the extent to
   which design variables of hierarchical loyalty programs may attenuate
   the negative consequences of status demotions with a second experimental
   scenario study and present an analytical model that links status
   demotion to customer equity to aid managerial decision making.

AB An often-overlooked constituent in the debate on counterfeiting is the
   consumer of the genuine article-a brand manager's primary constituent.
   These consumers are drawn to premium brands in part because of the
   exclusivity and connotation of prestige associated with them. These
   characteristics are also the reason such brands are attractive targets
   of counterfeiting. When premium brands are counterfeited, which in turn
   gives a variety of consumers access to them, how do consumers of the
   genuine items react to the erosion of exclusivity and prestige? An
   investigation involving premium brands in Thailand and India reveals
   that consumers of genuine items adopt one of three strategies when faced
   with the prospect of their favorite brands being counterfeited: flight
   (abandoning the brand), reclamation (elaborating the pioneering
   patronage of a brand), and abranding (disguising all brand cues). The
   author examines these strategies in detail, revealing how the potential
   loss of exclusivity and prestige can either drive genuine-item consumers
   away from the brand or impel them to make strong claims to their
   patronage.

AB Amid growing competition, retailers are increasingly interested in more
   effective aisle and display management strategies. These strategies
   involve placements of product categories in aisles and displays within
   each store to facilitate greater sales affinity (demand attraction)
   between categories to improve the store's share of customer wallet. The
   authors investigate the effects of aisle and display placements on the
   sales affinities between categories. They develop a spatial model of
   brand sales that allows for asymmetric store-specific affinity effects
   between two or more categories, while controlling for the effects of
   traditional merchandising and marketing-mix variables, such as price,
   feature, and display. They estimate the model on aggregate store-level
   data for regular cola and regular potato chip categories for a major
   retail chain, using hierarchical Bayesian methods. They show the
   usefulness and extension potential of the model through simulation of
   aisle placements for a third category. The results show that aisle and
   display placements have significant and sizable asymmetric effects on
   cross-category sales affinities comparable to those influenced by
   marketing-mix variables. Retail managers can use this detailed
   store-level model and subsequent insights to develop customized aisle
   and display management for their individual stores.

AB This article describes an investigation of the American Girl brand that
   provides a more complete and holistic understanding of sociocultural
   branding. Recent research on emotional branding, together with prior
   work on brands' symbolic nature and their role as relationship partners,
   represents a significant shift in the way marketers think about brands
   and brand management. However, a full understanding of powerful and
   emotionally resonant brands has been elusive, in part because
   sociocultural branding knowledge has accumulated in a piecemeal way and
   lacks coherence and integrity. In addition, powerful brands are
   extraordinarily complex and multifaceted, but in general they have been
   studied from a single perspective in a single setting. On the basis of a
   qualitative exploration of the American Girl brand that is both deep and
   broad, the authors posit that an emotionally powerful brand is best
   understood as the product of a complex system, or gestalt, whose
   component parts are in continuous interplay and together constitute a
   whole greater than their sum. Studying American Girl from the
   perspectives of various stakeholder groups in many of the venues in
   which the brand is manifest, the authors attempt to close the
   sociocultural branding research loop and identify implications for brand

   The authors argue that this requirement applies to the life sciences

   therapeutic medical devices. Marketers in the life sciences industry
   face novel and unique challenges along eight decision areas in therapy
   creation, therapy launch, and therapy promotion. In therapy creation,
   they face therapy pipeline optimization, innovation alliance formation,
   and therapy positioning decisions. In therapy launch, they face global
   market entry timing and key opinion leader selection decisions. Therapy
   promotion mostly revolves around sales force management, communication
   management, and stimulating patient compliance. The authors qualify
   these decision areas according to their practical importance and
   academic potential. The article derives preliminary generalizations and
   propositions from prior research and practice and steers further
   research in specific directions. The authors believe that marketing of
   the life sciences offers a fertile area for further research because,

   information has distinct determinants compared with those of external
   strategic information. The interrelationships between environmental
   uncertainty and the sharing of internal strategic information, including
   both main and interactive effects, are especially notable.

AB As a result of the diminishing effectiveness of broadcast advertising,
   firms are increasingly turning to product placements in films and
   television to promote their products. A growing stream of product
   placement research has conducted surveys of consumer and practitioner
   views on the practice and experiments to gauge product placement's
   impact on brand awareness, attitudes, and purchase intent. However,
   there is no evidence of whether firms' investments in film product
   placements are worthwhile. The event study of 126 product placements in
   successful films during 2002 reveals a mean cumulative abnormal return
   of .89% during the film's opening, indicating that product placement in
   a successful film is associated with positive movements in firm stock
   prices. Cross-sectional analysis of the returns offers new insight into
   how product, film, and execution factors influence the placement's
   worth. The authors find that placement abnormal returns are enhanced by
   tie-in advertising and brand equity but are inhibited by audience
   absorption, critical acclaim, and violent film content. Placement
   modality, character associations, and blatancy also significantly affect
   the placement's value.

AB Although the identification of customer needs constitutes a cornerstone
   of the marketing concept, the accuracy of frontline employees'
   perceptions of customer needs has never been examined in a systematic
   manner. Following research in social cognition, this article introduces
   the concept of "customer need knowledge" (CNK), which describes the
   extent to which a frontline employee can accurately identify a given
   customer's hierarchy of needs. The results of two large-scale,
   multilevel investigations involving data from three different levels
   (customers, employees, and managers) demonstrate the importance of CNK
   for the provision of customer satisfaction and customer value. In
   particular, CNK fully mediates the influence of employees' customer
   orientation and cognitive empathy on these customer outcomes. Moreover,
   whereas the length of the relationship between an employee and a
   particular customer enhances CNK, a large age discrepancy in relation to
   the customer decreases employees' level of CNK.

AB Prevailing wisdom assumes that female consumers are more loyal than male
   consumers. The authors report conditions under which the reverse is
   found, depending on the object of customer loyalty. For example, whereas
   female consumers tend to be more loyal than male consumers to
   individuals, such as individual service providers, this difference is
   reversed when the object of loyalty is a group of people. The authors
   find a similar crossover interaction effect for loyalty to individual
   employees versus loyalty to companies. This effect is mediated by
   self-construal in terms of relational versus collective interdependence.
   The authors discuss the managerial and theoretical implications of these
   gender differences.

AB In today's marketplace, many of the newer-generation convergence
   products (e.g., camera phones, all-in-one personal digital assistants)
   offer consumers product performance that rivals dedicated versions. With
   the increased availability of options, consumers now face another
   dilemma in their purchase consideration: Which product form should they
   choose-converged, dedicated, or both? This study investigates the choice
   patterns for product forms along the technology trajectories. In a
   series of four studies, the authors find that at low levels of
   technological performance, consumers overwhelmingly select convergence
   products over the dedicated options, whereas the choice pattern is
   reversed at high levels of technological performance. Furthermore, the
   authors demonstrate that a preannouncement of future technology can
   affect consumer preferences for product forms. Finally, they address the
   managerial implications and suggest directions for further research.

TI Self-Benefit Versus Other-Benefit Marketing Appeals: Their Effectiveness

AB Despite the growing need, nonprofit organization marketers have not yet
   fully delineated the most effective ways to position charitable appeals.
   Across five experiments, the authors test the prediction that
   other-benefit (self-benefit) appeals generate more favorable donation
   support than self-benefit (other-benefit) appeals in situations that
   heighten (versus minimize) public self-image concerns. Public
   accountability, a manipulation of public self-awareness, and individual
   differences in public self-consciousness all moderate the effect of
   appeal type on donor support. In particular, self-benefit appeals are
   more effective when consumers' responses are private in nature; in
   contrast, other-benefit appeals are more effective when consumers are
   publicly accountable for their responses. This effect is moderated by
   norm salience and is related to a desire to manage impressions by
   behaving in a manner consistent with normative expectations. The results
   have important managerial implications, suggesting that rather than
   simply relying on one type of marketing appeal across situations,
   marketers should tailor their marketing message to the situation or
   differentially activate public self-image concerns to match the appeal
   type.

AB Keyword advertising, or "sponsored links" that appear alongside online
   search results or other online content, has grown into a
   multibillion-dollar market. Providers of keyword advertising, such as
   Google and Yahoo, profit by auctioning keywords to advertisers. An issue
   of increasing importance for advertising providers is the "share
   structure" problem-that is, of the total available resources for each
   keyword (in terms of exposure), how large a share should be set aside
   for the highest bidder, for the second-highest bidder, and so on. The
   authors study this problem under a general specification and
   characterize the optimal share structures that maximize advertising
   providers' revenues. They also derive results on how the optimal share
   structure should change with advertisers' price elasticity of demand for
   exposure, their valuation distribution, total resources, and minimum
   bids. The authors draw implications for keyword auctions and other
   applications.
