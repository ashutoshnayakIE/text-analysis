AB We develop a conceptual framework regarding the perceptual transfer of
   haptic or touch-related characteristics from product containers to
   judgments of the products themselves. Thus, the firmness of a cup in
   which water is served may affect consumers' judgments of the water
   itself. This framework predicts that not all consumers are equally
   affected by such nondiagnostic haptic cues. Results from four studies
   show that consumers high in the autotelic need for touch (general liking
   for haptic input) are less affected by such nondiagnostic haptic cues
   compared to consumers low in the autotelic need for touch. The research
   has many implications for product and package design.

AB Three experiments show that semantic primes can enhance perceptual
   fluency, resulting in higher liking of the perceived product.
   Specifically, semantic primes that cue the visual identifier of one of
   two products (e. g., a bottle of wine with a frog shown on the label)
   increase preference of the prime-compatible target over another target
   (e. g., a wine without a frog on the label). This is observed even when
   exposure to the target is limited to levels associated with perceptual
   encoding of the target (experiment 1). Semantic priming of constructs
   compatible with perceptual features of the target increases liking of
   the target (experiments 2 and 3), and increased liking of the target is
   mediated by the target's increased visual appeal (experiment 3).

   examined in this study is a virtual community created through text-based
   conversations oriented toward peer-to-peer problem solving (P3).
   Empirical results support the conceptualization of social capital as an
   index composed of the normative influences of voluntarism, reciprocity,
   and social trust. Membership length was found to moderate the virtual P3
   community experience. Qualitative analysis of the community dialogue
   provides additional support for the characterization of virtual P3

   Surprisingly, later learning is characterized by attenuated learning

   consumers employ relational, not item-specific, processing. A framework
   clarifies how and when each of the aforementioned factors shapes context

   marketplace conditions and characteristics of the sponsoring company
   receive consideration, and both types of information influence
   evaluations. However, with a past launch, only sponsor information
   receives consideration and guides evaluations (experiments 1 and 2).
   This temporal frame effect is attenuated when certainty is primed,
   implying that the uncertainty associated with the future versus the past
   motivates more comprehensive use of available information in the future

   in the money condition, those in the time condition show a higher
   propensity to choose a compromise option (experiment 1) and to rely on
   an arbitrary anchor (experiment 2). We propose that such heuristics are
   used more for time because, compared to monetary expenditures, temporal
   expenditures are harder to account for. Consistent with this
   proposition, when participants in both time and money conditions are
   primed to account for their expenditures, they no longer differ in their
   use of heuristics. The associated response times offer additional

   not make predictions, despite consumers' expectations to the contrary.
   We explain our results in terms of anticipated regret. In fact, removing

AB Retrospective hedonic editing occurs when people combine events to frame
   a previous experience in its most positive light. Although reflecting
   positively on the past has psychological and physiological benefits, it
   may also be used to justify potentially irresponsible behavior. In a
   gambling context the consequences may be perilous. The results of study
   1 show that when they have the opportunity, potentially irresponsible
   gamblers use hedonic editing strategies to reconstruct the past as more
   positive. The more positive memory provides them with evidence to
   support their desired outcome-playing again. The results of studies 2
   and 3 reveal that the processes underlying hedonic editing include both
   the temporal categorization of positive and negative events and the
   strategic allocation of attention. Study 3 also investigates the

   Study 2 replicates this effect with partitioned versus consolidated

AB Two experiments (N = 16) explored the effects of evaluative conditioning
   on mature brands. Explicit attitudes for mature brands were unaffected
   by evaluative conditioning. Experiment 1 showed, however, that
   evaluative conditioning changed implicit attitudes toward Coke and
   Pepsi. This occurred only for participants who initially had no strong
   preference for either brand. Contingency awareness was not necessary to
   change implicit brand attitudes. Experiment 2 showed that brand choice
   was related to the altered implicit attitudes, but only when choice was
   made under cognitive load. Implications of these data for evaluative
   conditioning specifically, and for consumer research in general, are
   considered.

AB This work examines the process through which thrift versus prestige
   goals can nonconsciously affect decisions in a choice task. Drawing upon
   research on nonconscious goal pursuit, we present a theoretical
   framework detailing how consumer choices are affected by incidentally
   activated goals. We show that such primed goals have motivational
   properties consistent with goal pursuit but inconsistent with mere
   cognitive activation; the effects are greater with a longer time
   interval between the priming task and the choice and are less pronounced
   when the primed goal is satiated in a real, as opposed to a
   hypothetical, intervening choice task. Additionally, we show that
   subliminally evoked retail brand names can serve as the cues that
   activate purchasing goals.

AB What is the effect of option categorization on choosers' satisfaction? A
   combination of field and laboratory experiments reveals that the mere
   presence of categories, irrespective of their content, positively
   influences the satisfaction of choosers who are unfamiliar with the
   choice domain. This "mere categorization effect" is driven by a greater
   number of categories signaling greater variety among the available
   options, which allows for a sense of self-determination from choosing.
   This effect, however, is attenuated for choosers who are familiar with
   the choice domain, who do not rely on the presence of categories to
   perceive the variety available.

AB China's ideological transition from a communist country toward a

   the rise of consumerism in a contemporary society. We examine how
   advertising appropriates a dominant anticonsumerist political ideology
   to promote consumption within China's social and political transition.
   We show how advertising reconfigures both key political symbolism and
   communist propaganda strategies through a semiotic analysis of
   advertisements in the People's Daily. Our structural framework of
   ideological transition extends Barthes's myth model and examines
   ideological transition in advertising from the macroperspective of
   political ideology. This framework goes beyond the transfer of cultural
   meanings and can help to explain ideological shifts in other societies.

   expenses (study 1). The difficulty of estimating budgets for the next

AB Three experiments examine how power affects consumers' spending
   propensities. By integrating literatures suggesting that (a)
   powerlessness is aversive, (b) status is one basis of power, and (c)
   products can signal status, the authors argue that low power fosters a
   desire to acquire products associated with status to compensate for
   lacking power. Supporting this compensatory hypothesis, results show
   that low power increased consumers' willingness to pay for auction items
   and consumers' reservation prices in negotiations but only when products
   were status related. The link between powerlessness and compensatory
   consumption has broad implications both for consumers' health and
   well-being and for understanding the psychological state of power.

   to the same degree with unipolar emotions. Of note, the decline in
   memory of mixed emotions is distinct from the pattern found for memory
   of negative emotions, implying that the recall bias is diagnostic of the
   complexity of mixed emotions rather than of any association with
   negative affect. Finally, the memory decay effect was driven by the felt

   This effect occurs primarily among low-self-esteem consumers. We explain

AB Despite the growing consensus that consumer preferences are often

   has a significant effect on their strength and stability. In particular,
   we propose that option set configuration, asymmetric dominance versus
   compromise, drives the decision process and whether consumers
   (consciously) focus on the chosen option or the context. This, in turn,
   affects the resulting decision process trace, as reflected in choice
   stability, confidence, and attribution. The results of five studies
   support this proposition. Thus, the strength of constructed preferences
   is a function of choice problem characteristics and the construction
   process.

   Appeals employing descriptive norms (e. g., "the majority of guests
   reuse their towels") proved superior to a traditional appeal widely used
   by hotels that focused solely on environmental protection. Moreover,
   normative appeals were most effective when describing group behavior
   that occurred in the setting that most closely matched individuals'

   Increasing the accessibility of the contextual information prompted a

AB About $10 billion a year is spent by consumers worldwide on online
   gambling, and that number continues to grow. We present a qualitative,
   image-based study of 30 Las Vegas online and casino gamblers. By
   examining online gambling as a consumption experience, we examine what
   happens to consumption meaning as gambling moves away from a regulated
   physical space to an unregulated online space, one accessed from home.
   We explore the meaning of online gambling consumption to consumers and
   flesh out the social welfare implications of our findings.

AB Through pleasure, a foundational concept in consumer behavior, we offer
   an analysis of the history, development, and experience of clubbing, the
   postcursor of rave and the contextual focus of this article. On the
   basis of a 5-year study primarily involving participant observation and
   interviewing, we present an analysis of how the clubbing experience is
   cocreated by promoters, DJs, and clubbers themselves. We develop and
   demonstrate a biosocial conceptualization of pleasure and show how the
   shared experience of music and dance, the organization of space, and the
   effects of the drug ecstasy combine to produce a highly sought-after,
   calculated suspension of the rules and norms of everyday life. Further,
   we suggest that the club, as well as the pleasurable practices and
   experiences that it supports, has become a site of contained illegality.
   Here, the illicit, subversive practices of rave have now become
   shepherded and channeled into more predictable, manageable, and
   regulated environments facilitated by the "knowing wink" of club
   promoters, police, and state authorities. Implications for consumer
   research are discussed.

AB This research explores goal-related categorization processes as part of
   a three-phase model encompassing both antecedents (goal selection) and
   consequences (purchase likelihood). In each phase, we identify
   conditions under which self-control goals (indulgence or restriction
   goals) and trait self-control may either correspond or conflict. Three
   experiments demonstrate that when no trait-goal conflict occurs,
   categorization patterns and purchase intentions are consistent with
   self-control tendencies. However, when conflicts exist between trait
   self-control and goals, individuals engage in motivated categorization
   or revert to behaviors consistent with trait self-control.
   Interestingly, results suggest that either conflict resolution mechanism
   may undermine the likelihood of goal attainment.

   This selective hypothesis testing perspective on unrealistic optimism
   suggests that estimates of future behavior should be similar to those
   made by individuals who assume that conditions will be ideal. Moreover,
   consumers who initially provide estimates assuming that conditions will
   be ideal should recognize that the world is not ideal and so should test
   a more realistic hypothesis. In line with these predictions, we find
   that ideal-world estimates (e. g., In an ideal world, how often will you
   exercise next week?) do not differ from standard estimates (e. g., How
   often will you exercise next week?). We also find that individuals who
   initially estimate their behavior in an ideal world subsequently make

   information. In such situations, consumers often have the option not to
   choose any of the alternatives to avoid uncertainty. Alternatively,
   consumers can make inferences about the missing attributes. These
   inferences may occur spontaneously, or they may be strategically
   prompted. In five studies, it is shown that both explicitly and
   implicitly prompting consumers to make inferences about the missing
   attributes reduces the tendency to select the no-choice option and
   increases the likelihood of making a purchase decision. In parallel,
   consumers who generate spontaneous inferences are also less likely to

   demonstrate that because choosing from larger assortments is often more
   difficult, it leads people to select options that are easier to justify.
   Virtues and utilitarian necessities are generally easier to justify than
   indulgences; consequently, choosing from larger assortments often shifts
   choice from vices to virtues and from hedonic to utilitarian options.
   These effects reverse, however, when situational factors provide
   accessible reasons to indulge, underscoring the role of justification.

   hypotheses regarding the manner in which brand personality and

   Results show that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to be
   differentially influenced by brand personalities. Further, the results
   indicate that the level of avoidance predicts the types of brand
   personality that are most relevant to anxious individuals. Specifically,
   under conditions of high avoidance and high anxiety, individuals exhibit
   a preference for exciting brands; however, under conditions of low
   avoidance and high anxiety, individuals tend to prefer sincere brands.
   The differential preference for sincere (vs. exciting) brand personality
   emerges in public (vs. private) consumption settings and in settings
   where interpersonal relationship expectations are high, supporting a

AB This research examines how consumers behave after they miss a sale and
   subsequently face a smaller sale for the same or different product.
   According to the proposed theory, a two-way interaction is predicted in
   which adding another similar alternative to the choice set leads to
   higher choice deferral without prior sale information but lower choice
   deferral with information about missing a larger sale on one of the
   alternatives. In addition, the new alternative in the choice set becomes
   more attractive and captures most of the market share. The results from
   three lab experiments and one field experiment confirm the hypotheses
   and the proposed mechanism. The article concludes with a discussion of
   the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

AB Over the past 2 decades, a large body of research has examined how
   materialism is formed and how this value influences well-being. Although
   these studies have substantially contributed to our understanding of
   materialism, they shed little light on this value's relationship to
   consumer behavior. Our research seeks to address this gap by examining
   the influence of materialism on self- and communal-brand connections. We
   ground our conceptualization in terror management theory and suggest
   that materialistic individuals form strong connections to their brands
   as a response to existential insecurity. We test this premise by
   conducting a national survey among 314 adults as well as an experiment
   among 125 college students. Our results provide broad support for our
   thesis and suggest that the fear of death encourages materialistic
   individuals to form strong connections with their brands.

AB The research presented in this article provides evidence that add-on
   features sold to enhance a product can be more than just discretionary
   benefits. We argue that consumers draw inferences from the mere
   availability of add-ons, which in turn lead to significant changes in
   the perceived utility of the base good itself. Specifically, we propose
   that the improvements supplied by add-ons can be classified as either
   alignable or nonalignable and that they have opposing effects on
   evaluation. A set of four experiments with different product categories
   confirms this prediction. In addition, we show that the amount of
   product information available to consumers and expectations about
   product composition play important moderating roles. From a practical
   standpoint, these results highlight the need for firms to be mindful of
   the behavioral implications of making add-ons readily available in the

AB The present research shows that when a confidently held self-view (e.g.,
   "I am an exciting person") is temporarily cast in doubt, individuals are
   motivated to choose products that bolster their original self-view
   (e.g., choosing brands with exciting brand personalities). The findings
   across three studies suggest that subtle manipulations can temporarily
   "shake" one's self-view confidence, resulting in an increased propensity
   of choosing self-view-bolstering products in a subsequent choice task.
   The consequences of the "shaken self" for product choices are examined
   in different self-domains. The findings also suggest that the effects of
   the shaken self are attenuated when individuals have the opportunity to
   restore their self-view confidence prior to the final choice task.

AB This research focuses on a pervasive but largely unexamined product
   attribute-freshness date-to shed light on how and why its influence on
   the consumption of perishable products changes with product ownership.
   Drawing on recent research on the endowment effect, we demonstrate that
   even when the differential costs implicit in ownership are controlled
   for, consumers are more likely to actually consume a product past its
   freshness date when they own it than when they do not. Moreover, this
   ownership-based increase in consumption is accompanied by lower
   estimates by consumers of their likelihood of getting sick from
   consuming the product past its freshness date. These outcomes are
   driven, in turn, by consumers' ownership-based susceptibility to engage
   in selective and confirmatory testing of the hypothesis that the product
   past its freshness date is consumption worthy (i.e., approach goal)
   rather than the alternate, default hypothesis that it is not consumption
   worthy (i.e., avoidance goal).

   occurs when there is a fit between an individual's regulatory goal and

   ability, manipulated through cognitive load, influence the use of the
   compromise heuristic. Three studies showed that NFC is associated with
   less compromise at baseline but not under load. Process measures and

   interruptions can disrupt this adaptation process and restore the

   purchases that turned out positively, experiential purchases lead to
   more happiness than do material purchases, as the experience
   recommendation suggests. However, for purchases that turned out
   negatively, experiences have no benefit over ( and, for some types of
   consumers, induce significantly less happiness than) material
   possessions. We provide evidence that this purchase type by valence

AB Across six studies, we demonstrate that consumers have beliefs
   pertaining to the transience of emotion, which, along with their current
   feelings, determine the extent to which they regulate their immediate
   affect. If consumers believe that emotion is fleeting, those feeling
   happy (vs. unhappy) engage in affect regulation because they infer that
   they need to take actions to maintain their positive feelings. In
   contrast, if consumers believe that emotion is lasting, those feeling
   unhappy (vs. happy) engage in affect regulation because they infer that
   the negative feelings will persist unless they take actions to repair
   them. These effects are obtained with measured and with manipulated
   beliefs, and they occur only when the theories pertain specifically to
   emotion. Implications and areas for future research are discussed.

AB Using multimethod data, we investigate retirement as a life stage
   centered on consumption, where cultural scripts are particularly
   contested and in flux and where we witness an increase in breadth and
   depth of identity-related consumption, which we term consumer identity
   renaissance. While prior research on older consumers focuses on
   corporeal and cognitive decline and its impact on individual
   decision-making situations, our attention is drawn to the competency and
   growth potential of those who have exited their formal productive stage
   and privilege consumption as a means to create and enact identity.
   Contrary to the received view of older consumers simply reviewing and
   integrating their already developed identities, we find retirement can
   be a time of extensive identity work with multiple revived and emergent
   inspirations weaving across all time orientations (past, present, and
   future) and involving intricate consumption enactments.

AB The results of five field and laboratory experiments reveal a "time
   versus money effect" whereby activating time (vs. money) leads to a
   favorable shift in product attitudes and decisions. Because time
   increases focus on product experience, activating time (vs. money)
   augments one's personal connection with the product, thereby boosting
   attitudes and decisions. However, because money increases the focus on
   product possession, the reverse effect can occur in cases where merely
   owning the product reflects the self (i.e., for prestige possessions or
   for highly materialistic consumers). The time versus money effect proves
   robust across implicit and explicit methods of construct activation.

   In three cross-cultural studies on service failures, we show that these

   that Asian (vs. Western) consumers are more dissatisfied with social
   failures but less dissatisfied with nonsocial failures. We further
   demonstrate that these contrasting effects of culture are sensitive to
   pertinent contextual factors such as the presence of other consumers or
   a fate-suggestive brand name. Overall, our research evinces the
   multidimensionality of cultural influence and points to the need for a

   researchers to treat the two variables as substitutes. We propose that
   cognitive busyness and need for closure have distinct roots and can have
   different effects. We examine their distinction in the context of
   cultural differences in the two types of socially desirable
   responding-impression management and self-deceptive enhancement. Our
   findings indicate that high (vs. low) cognitive busyness weakens the
   relationship between culture and impression management, but not that
   between culture and self-deceptive enhancement. In contrast, high (vs.
   low) need for closure strengthens both relationships. The article

AB Extrinsic cues such as price and irrelevant attributes have been shown
   to bias consumers' product judgments. Results in this article replicate
   those findings in pretrial judgments but show that such biasing cues can
   improve quality judgments at a later point in time. Initially biasing
   cues can even yield more accurate judgments than cues that do not bias
   pretrial judgments and can help consumers after a delay (e.g., at the
   time of repeat purchase) to determine how much they had liked a product
   when they tried it before. These results suggest that trying to deceive

AB Past research has found that changes in price endings can result in
   "left-digit effects" whereby the magnitude of an item's price relative
   to the price of a reference product is influenced by the leftmost digits
   of both prices. We extend this work by investigating the impact of
   changes in price endings and associated leftmost price digits on choice.
   Findings indicate that assigning different combinations of price endings
   to two products (e.g., $2.00 and $2.99 vs. $1.99 and $3.00 vs. $2.00 and
   $3.00) can shift choice share toward the lower-or higher-priced
   alternative. We also find that changes between just-below (e.g., $29.99
   and $39.99) and round (e.g., $30.00 and $40.00) pricing affect choice,
   with just-below pricing shifting share toward lower-priced alternatives.
   The latter effects are found to be moderated by price level and shopping
   goals. A three-path mediation model reveals the processes underlying the
   influence of price endings on choice.

   (imagining their feelings in a future period, then considering how those
   feelings might be different were the impacting event to happen). Four
   studies show that backcasters expect events to have a greater hedonic
   impact than do forecasters, largely because they think more about the
   impacting event. The studies also reveal that backcasters consider other

AB Past research in consumer behavior typically assumes that distraction
   during the decision process needs to be avoided. However, a common piece
   of advice given to consumers who have to make complex decisions is to
   distract their attention away from the decision problem for some
   moments. The current research shows that distraction can indeed help
   consumers to differentiate attractive from unattractive products. Yet
   this occurs only for consumers with a configural mind-set who tend to
   form coherent representations of products in their memory. For consumers
   with a featural mind-set, who typically hold mixed product
   representations, distraction does not affect product evaluations. This
   implies that it is the specific processing mind-set of consumers that
   determines whether distraction leads to more product differentiation or
   not.

   self-regulatory decisions in consumer settings tend to be similar in the

   pivotal role of similarity. When two consecutive self-regulatory
   situations require similar control processes (e.g., restraining food

AB Against common intuition, we find that variety in an assortment reduces

   quantity estimates when shown random patterns of identical colored dots
   or geometric shapes than when those patterns contain variety. The
   difference in perceived quantity does not grow as the number of
   different types increases beyond two, and it disappears if the overall
   area occupied by the set is made salient through context. We attribute
   the results to the natural consolidation of identical items into a
   single Gestalt whole that makes the set seem larger. Two additional
   studies show that this perceptual influence also causes people to pour
   more when using varied items to match a sample of food. The article
   closes with a discussion of the potential implications of these findings

   enduring behavioral effects, and when the same prime leads to semantic
   activation, characterized by short-lived effects. This research proposes
   an activation-striving model, which proposes that behavioral effects of
   primes are moderated by discrepancies between the prime and the

AB One's own emotions may influence someone else's behavior in a social
   interaction. If one believes this, she or he has an incentive to game
   emotions-to strategically modify the expression of a current emotional
   state-in an attempt to influence her or his counterpart. In a series of
   three experiments, this article investigates the extent to which people
   (1) misrepresent a current emotional state, (2) willfully acknowledge
   their strategic actions, (3) choose to game emotions over nonemotional
   information, and (4) improve their financial well-being from emotion
   gaming.

AB To properly consider the opportunity costs of a purchase, consumers must
   actively generate the alternatives that it would displace. The current
   research suggests that consumers often fail to do so. Even under
   conditions promoting cognitive effort, various cues to consider
   opportunity costs reduce purchase rates and increase the choice share of
   more affordable options. Sensitivity to such cues varies with chronic
   dispositional differences in spending attitudes. We discuss the
   implications of these results for the marketing strategies of economy
   and premium brands.

AB Consumers frequently consume items to the point where they no longer
   enjoy them. In a pilot study and two experiments spanning three distinct
   classes of stimuli, we find that people can recover from this satiation
   by simply recalling the variety of alternative items they have consumed
   in the past. And yet, people seem to exhibit "variety amnesia" in that
   they do not spontaneously recall this past variety despite the fact that
   it would result in a desirable decrease in satiation. Thus, rather than
   satiation being a fixed physiological process, it appears that it is at
   least partially constructed in the moment. We discuss some of the
   theoretical implications of these findings and provide some prescriptive
   measures for both marketers and consumers.

AB Can properties of emotions other than valence influence consumers'

   motivation moderates whether their attitudes are based on the valence of
   or the resource demands imposed by the emotion featured in an ad. When
   motivation is low, consumers respond more favorably to positively versus
   negatively valenced emotional ads. However, when motivation is high,
   attitudes are more favorable when the magnitude of allocated resources
   matches that required to process the ad. Three studies identify three
   distinct properties of emotions (univalence, purity, and

AB This article examines the effect of spatial confinement on consumer
   choices. Building on reactance theory and the environmental psychology
   literature, we propose that spatially confined consumers react against
   an incursion to their personal space by making more varied and unique
   choices. We present four laboratory experiments and one field study to
   support our theorizing. Study 1 demonstrates that people in narrower
   aisles seek more variety than people in wider aisles. Study 2 indicates
   that this effect of confinement in narrow aisles also extends to more
   unique choices. Study 3 shows that perceptions of confinement exert
   their strongest influence on people who are chronically high in
   reactance. Study 4 suggests that influencing perceptions of confinement
   is sufficient to evoke variety seeking. Finally, the field study uses
   crowding as a proxy for confinement and finds a positive relationship
   between crowding and variety seeking in real grocery purchases.

   consumers facing uncertainty (rather than certainty) associated with a

   sustainability of this pleasurable uncertainty effect hinges on the

AB Once a product has been evaluated for use, the circumstances can change
   and it must be reevaluated for use at a different time. Four experiments
   investigated processes underlying these reevaluations. Participants
   received information about a product that had implications for both
   desirability and the feasibility of using it, while anticipating either
   its immediate or future use. They were later asked to reevaluate the
   product for use at either the same or a different point in time.
   Participants who reevaluated the product for future use based their
   judgments on desirability considerations regardless of when they had
   considered using it initially. However, participants who reevaluated the
   product for immediate use also based their judgments on desirability
   considerations unless they had initially considered immediate use as
   well. These results were consistent with a conceptualization of consumer
   judgment processes that incorporated implications of research on

AB A series of experiments examined the amount that consumers were willing

   consumers were willing to pay for each product when sold individually.
   However, a "freebie" offer did not influence the overall price for the
   bundle of disparate products, a finding robust across two different
   settings and populations. The differential effect of freebies is
   explained by varying judgment difficulty, with the price being easier to
   arrive at for just a single product than for the combination. Consistent
   with this explanation, factors that influence judgment difficulty ( the
   salience of the company's motive for offering the freebie and time
   pressure to make a judgment) moderated the effects of a free offer on
   the amount consumers were willing to pay.

AB Labeled the "denomination effect," study 1 shows in three field studies
   that the likelihood of spending is lower when an equivalent sum of money
   is represented by a single large denomination (e.g., one $20 bill)
   relative to many smaller denominations (e.g., 20 $1 bills). In two of
   the three field studies, individuals spent more once the decision to
   spend had been made. Study 2 then shows that consumers deliberately
   choose to receive money in a large denomination relative to small
   denominations when there is a need to exert self-control in spending.
   Study 3 further shows that the denomination effect is contingent on
   individual differences in people's desire to reduce the pain of paying
   associated with spending. The results suggest that the denomination
   effect occurs because large denominations are psychologically less
   fungible than smaller ones, allowing them to be used as a strategic
   device to control and regulate spending.

   Although seventh graders use more products and brands to form

   to define roles, such as personality traits, therefore forming
   constellations with fewer elements overall. By late adolescence,

   consumers respond to products that are offered on a "take it or leave

   substantially, allowing consumers to have much more control over the
   product's characteristics. This research examines the factors
   influencing consumers' evaluations of self-designed products. Three
   studies demonstrate that a superior fit between consumers' underlying
   preferences and their customized products cannot fully explain
   self-design evaluations. Comparisons with designers of comparable
   products can significantly influence evaluations as well. The first two
   experiments examine how social comparisons with the designers of similar
   "off-the-rack" products influence evaluations, identifying two key
   moderators useful in overcoming the negative effects of an upward
   comparison. A third study uses a real online design task to gain
   understanding of how the timing of the social comparison moderates the
   direction of the comparison ( upward vs. equivalent) to influence
   evaluations.

AB Our study contributes to understanding the role of material culture in
   families. Findings from a longitudinal case study extend Kopytoff's
   theory of singularization by explaining what occurs between the
   singularization of a focal object and its recommodification. We uncover
   processes that move an already singularized object in and out of a
   network of practices, objects, and spaces; identify forces that
   constrain and empower a singularized object's agency within that
   network; and demonstrate network transformations that result from the
   focal object's movement. This extension explains some paradoxical
   findings in consumer research: how objects are granted agency even while
   displaced, when irreplaceable objects can be replaced, and why families
   sometimes displace central identity practices.

AB Drawing from image-elicited depth interviews, we investigate whether
   consumers pursue the consumption of authentic objects with specific
   personal goals in mind. We find that consumers are motivated to focus on
   those particular cues in objects that for them convey authenticity (what
   is genuine, real, and/or true) and that this decision-making process is
   driven by a desire to draw different identity benefits (control,
   connection, virtue) from authentic objects. Our interpretive analysis
   elaborates contributions to theorizing related to consumer agency in
   seeking authentic consumption experience. We provide cultural
   explanations for the desire to assert the authentic self in these
   particular ways.

   consequences of overconsumption believe that membership in a support
   group is crucial to their well-being? We examine how Weight Watchers,
   the world's largest support group, aids its members' attempts at
   managing their overweight condition. This article advances the view that
   in the United States, support groups that are organized around issues of
   overconsumption, such as Weight Watchers, resonate with members' quest
   for well-being in light of the spiritual-therapeutic model. The
   spiritual-therapeutic model denotes the understanding of well-being
   inscribed within the contemporary American cultural milieu. We find that
   among Weight Watchers members in the United States, the support group
   acts as a venue for angst-alleviating therapeutic confession, fosters
   the enactment of the support group as a benevolent system of therapeutic
   oversight, and facilitates a revitalizing practice of autotherapeutic
   testimonial.

AB We examine how perceptions of a product are affected by the presence of
   extreme exemplars and find that ambiguity of the product is an important
   moderator. When the target is a novel one, perceptions assimilate to the
   context, whereas when it is highly familiar, perceptions are immune to
   the influence of context. This is as predicted by the
   interpretation-comparison model. Contrary to this model, however, we
   find that effects on perceptions are not always assimilative in nature.
   When product ambiguity falls between the extremes of novel and highly
   familiar, a contrast effect in perception can occur. This is consistent
   with the selective accessibility model, which says that a perceptual
   contrast effect occurs when conditions orient respondents to
   dissimilarities rather than to similarities among context and target
   items. In the experiments conducted, context-induced response language
   effects were circumvented by employing forced-anchor scales.

AB Consumers hold a common intuition about their preferences for familiar
   things (e. g., "comfort food") in times of upheaval. This lay theory
   holds that familiar goods are attractive as a respite from dynamic
   environments and reflects a naive prediction that familiar favorites
   ameliorate the cognitive or emotional load associated with change.
   Conversely, the research in this article finds that consumers are more
   rather than less likely to choose novel options during times of upheaval
   and suggests that this paradox may occur because of the discrepancy
   between consumers' strategic lay theories and more automatic mind-set
   influences. Five studies demonstrate (1) that the comfort food fallacy
   effect occurs for both food and nonfood choices (despite consumer
   predictions to the contrary), (2) that increasing consumers' perception
   of life change decreases choice of familiar favorites, and (3) that the
   effect disappears with high involvement. Understanding this paradox of
   comfort consumption may help both consumers and marketers promote
   positive change and innovation adoption.

   extreme the higher the run length of the stocks ( the consecutive number
   of upward or downward movements of a price series with identical mean,
   variance, skewness, and kurtosis). Three experiments show that this
   leads to stocks with higher run lengths being perceived as riskier: the
   run-length effect. Importantly, the run-length effect is greater for
   investors who are more educated, are employed full time, trade more
   frequently, have had longer experience trading, and trade a wider range
   of financial instruments. Implications for the communication of

   effects of mood, which are not sensitive to delay or to the presence of
   real-time evaluations. The mismatch between lay beliefs and actual

AB Consumer researchers have tended to equate consumer moralism with

   little research has investigated the multifaceted forms of identity work
   that consumers can undertake through more diverse ideological forms of
   consumer moralism. To redress this theoretical gap, we analyze the
   adversarial consumer narratives through which a brand-mediated moral
   conflict is enacted. We show that consumers' moralistic identity work is
   culturally framed by the myth of the moral protagonist and further
   illuminate how consumers use this mythic structure to transform their
   ideological beliefs into dramatic narratives of identity. Our resulting
   theoretical framework explicates identity-value-enhancing relationships
   among mythic structure, ideological meanings, and marketplace resources
   that have not been recognized by prior studies of consumer identity
   work.

   research suggests that Bourdieu's status consumption model, based upon
   Western research, does not provide an adequate explanation. And what we
   call the global trickle-down model, often invoked to explain LIC status
   consumption, is even more imprecise. We study the status consumption
   strategies of upper-middle-class Turkish women in order to revise three
   of Bourdieu's most important concepts-cultural capital, habitus, and
   consumption field-to propose a theory specific to the LIC context. We
   demonstrate that cultural capital is organized around orthodox practice
   of the Western Lifestyle myth, that cultural capital is
   deterritorialized and so accrues through distant text-book-like learning
   rather than via the habitus, and that the class faction with lower
   cultural capital indigenizes the consumption field to sustain a national
   social hierarchy.

AB Scent research has focused primarily on the effects of ambient scent on
   consumer evaluations. We focus instead on the effects of product scent
   on consumer memories. For instance, if a pencil or a facial tissue is
   imbued with scent ( vs. not), recall for the brand's other attributes
   increases significantly-with the effects lasting as much as 2 weeks
   after exposure. We also find that product scent is more effective than
   ambient scent at enhancing memory for product information. We suggest
   that this may be because, with product ( ambient) scent, scent-related
   associations are focused on a single object ( are diffused across
   multiple objects) in the environment. In support, we find that the
   memory effects are driven by the number of product/scent-related
   associations stored in long-term memory. The results suggest that,
   although ambient scent has received the bulk of attention from
   researchers and managers in recent years, greater focus on product scent
   is warranted.

AB This research examines whether mental budgets, defined as self-specified
   allowances for behaviors, can help with self-control. We theorize that
   mental budgets will lead to greater self-control when the avoidance
   aspects of the behavior are made salient and when the decision context
   allows easy monitoring of one's own behavior. Study 1 finds that mental
   budgets help reduce consumption of indulgent products when avoidance
   aspects of the behavior are made salient. Study 2 finds that even when
   avoidance aspects are made salient, mental budgets are effective only
   when option information enables monitoring of one's choices relative to
   the budget. Study 3 finds that external reference points ( a feature of
   both studies 1 and 2) play a critical role in reducing consumption.
   Study 4 extends the findings from studies 1 and 3 and finds that mental
   budgets are effective in enhancing self-control if the person also has a
   high chronic prevention focus.

AB This research proposes that consumers hold "lay theories of medicine"
   that guide their preferences and behaviors in the health domain. Lay
   theories of medicine incorporate lay beliefs about illnesses and
   symptoms (i.e., a form of lay diagnosis that may feature causal
   [un]certainty) and lay beliefs about health remedies (i.e., a treatment
   function that takes into account how consumers think remedies work,
   including the focus and action rapidity of treatment as additional
   dimensions of response efficacy). According to the conceptual framework,
   lay diagnosis and treatment beliefs together drive consumer preference
   among alternative health remedies, which, in turn, has downstream
   consequences for a healthy lifestyle. A series of studies finds support
   for this framework in an investigation of Western medicine and its
   Eastern counterparts ( traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines)
   among Chinese, Indian, and Asian American consumers.

   carry over to unrelated current tasks. This implies the counterintuitive
   notion that anticipating difficult tasks in the future leads to greater

AB Planning has pronounced effects on consumer behavior and intertemporal
   choice. We develop a six-item scale measuring individual differences in
   propensity to plan that can be adapted to different domains and used to
   compare planning across domains and time horizons. Adaptations tailored
   to planning time and money in the short run and long run each show
   strong evidence of reliability and validity. We find that propensity to
   plan is moderately domain-specific. Scale measures and actual planning
   measures show that for time, people plan much more for the short run
   than the long run; for money, short- and long-run planning differ less.
   Time and money adaptations of our scale exhibit sharp differences in
   nomological correlates; short- run and long-run adaptations differ less.
   Domain-specific adaptations predict frequency of actual planning in
   their respective domains. A "very long-run" money adaptation predicts
   FICO credit scores; low planners thus face materially higher cost of
   credit.

AB The present research explores a self-control operation, namely,
   counteractive construal, that helps consumers resolve the conflicts
   between an important goal and a short-term temptation by altering the
   construal of the temptation. We propose that when experiencing a
   self-control conflict, consumers intentionally construe temptation as
   more damaging to the attainment of a long-term goal and use these
   distorted construals to help resolve the conflict in favor of the goals.
   Four studies in two self-regulatory domains ( a dieting goal and an
   academic goal) provided converging evidence for the counteractive
   construal hypothesis. We found that people who were experiencing
   self-control conflict expected tempting food items to contain more
   calories or expected parties to take more time away from studying and
   were consequently less interested in consuming these temptations.

   of approach, even toward a negative outcome, makes them feel more
   positively toward the negative outcome and associated outcomes.
   Experiment 1 demonstrates a positive effect of embodied movement in

   additionally show positive effects of psychological movement in time,

   satisfaction. For more knowledgeable consumers, unexpected subcategory
   formats provide a newness cue, thereby increasing effort, learning, and
   satisfaction. That is, unexpected subcategory formats help more
   knowledgeable consumers overcome complacency and benefit more from their
   shopping experience. Conversely, unexpected subcategory formats lead to
   decreases in learning and satisfaction among lower prior knowledge
   consumers. Interestingly, we also find that consumers are relatively
   well calibrated with regard to the effects of more and less expected
   subcategory formats, anticipating that less expected formats may help
   more knowledgeable consumers. Taken together, these findings suggest
   that subcategory formats can be tailored to consumers' prior knowledge
   levels in ways that yield both expected and actual benefits.

AB This article introduces the dialogical nature of self to study
   consumers' inner dialogs in order to understand consumers' marketplace
   decisions and conflicts. The authors explore the meaning of consumption
   at multiple self levels and dialogical relationships to manage
   differences. The study uses mixed methods including in-depth interviews,
   multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, and metaphors to distill
   important voices in their informants. They find that the consumption
   stories vary across self levels. The meta-self level reflects a
   dispassionate representation of the primary I-positions in consumers and
   does not explain what the consumers experience at the time of actual
   consumption. An examination of inconsistent consumption preferences at
   the level of I-positions reveals that dialogical relationships labeled
   compartmentalization, compassion, negotiation, and coalition can avoid
   and manage conflicts, while relationships involving opposition and
   domination reflect unresolved conflicts. Suggestions to use the
   dialogical self model for addressing issues of negative selves,
   addictions, and domination in future research are provided.

   Many research projects have been terminated early in a research program
   or later in the review process because the data did not conform to Baron
   and Kenny's criteria, impeding theoretical development. While the
   technical literature has disputed some of Baron and Kenny's tests, this

   cannot be explained by differences in valence between abstract and

AB Consumers use warmth and competence, two fundamental dimensions that

   experiments showed that consumers perceive nonprofits as being warmer
   than for-profits but as less competent. Further, consumers are less
   willing to buy a product made by a nonprofit than a for-profit because
   of their perception that the firm lacks competence. Consequently, when
   perceived competence of a nonprofit is boosted through subtle cues that
   connote credibility, discrepancies in willingness to buy disappear. In
   fact, when consumers perceive high levels of competence and warmth, they
   feel admiration for the firm-which translates to consumers' increased
   desire to buy. This work highlights the importance of consumer
   stereotypes about nonprofit and for-profit companies that, at baseline,
   come with opposing advantages and disadvantages but that can be altered.

   in the United States suggests that disconfirmation sensitivity lowers
   expectations. Here we examine whether belief in karma and, consequently,
   having a long-term orientation, counteracts the tendency to lower
   expectations in two studies that measure and prime respondents' belief
   in karma. Results show that the extent of belief in karma, operating
   largely through its impact on long-run orientation, does moderate

   find incidence of in-store slack. Moreover, we find support for our

   Such placebo-like effects are typically attributed to conditioning,

   shows such effects can also occur because, under some conditions, people
   are more prone to underestimate the time to onset of products they have
   used in the past. These recollections of too short a time to onset alter
   people's experience of products and cause them to report more rapid
   effects. Participants who were led to believe there was a strong causal
   link between having consumed a product and improved performance on a
   task recalled that less time elapsed before they experienced an effect.
   In subsequent consumption, they felt comfortable using the product later
   in time, started working on a similar task earlier upon use, experienced
   the product's effect sooner, and were less inclined to switch to

   that go well beyond the incivility incident. We demonstrate the process
   by which these effects occur, showing that anger at the uncivil employee
   induces these effects. We find that anger leads to rumination about the
   uncivil encounter and causes customers to make quicker and more negative

AB What are the differences in exerting self-control in sequential choices
   when consumers choose for others (family or friends) rather than for
   themselves? Sequential choices represent an opportunity to manage the
   pursuit of one's multiple personal goals. Consumers typically manage
   these personal goals by combining indulgent and virtuous choices. When
   choosing for others, however, this is not the case. Consumers then focus
   on a pleasure-seeking goal, which leads to indulgent choices for others.
   Six experiments demonstrate this phenomenon and uncover conditions that
   encourage more virtuous choices for others.

AB Studies suggest that certain vowel and consonant sounds ( or phonemes)
   can be associated with perceptions of large and small size. Mental
   rehearsal of prices containing numbers with small phonemes results in
   overestimation of price discounts, whereas mental rehearsal of prices
   containing numbers with large phonemes results in underestimation.
   Mental rehearsal of the same sale prices characterized by small phonemes
   in one language and large phonemes in another language can yield
   differential effects. For example, when sale prices are rehearsed in
   English, an $11.00 - $7.88 (28.4%) discount is perceived as greater than
   a $10.00 - $7.01 (29.9%) discount; however, when these same prices are
   rehearsed in Chinese, the latter discount is perceived as greater.
   Non-price-related phonemes do not yield these same discount distortions.
   Collectively, findings indicate that the mere sounds of numbers can
   nonconsciously affect and distort numerical magnitude perceptions.

AB Ads often contain puffery-product descriptions that purport to be
   important but actually provide little if any meaningful information.
   Consumers' reactions to these descriptions depend on whether they
   perceive themselves to be more or less knowledgeable about the product
   than others whom the ad is specifically intended to influence. When an
   ad appears in a professional magazine that is read primarily by experts
   in the product domain, puffery generally increases the ad's
   effectiveness. This is also true when the ad appears in a popular
   magazine but readers perceive themselves to know less about the product
   than consumers at large. If readers believe they know as much as or more
   than general consumers, however, puffery decreases the ad's
   effectiveness. In addition, the media context in which an ad is
   encountered has a direct effect on judgments by consumers who perceive
   themselves to have little knowledge about the type of product being
   advertised.

AB Americans live in a political, social, and historical context that
   values personal freedom and choice above all else, an emphasis that has
   been amplified by contemporary psychology. However, this article reviews
   research that shows that in non-Western cultures and among working-class
   Westerners, freedom and choice do not have the meaning or importance
   they do for the university-educated people who have been the subjects of
   almost all research on this topic. We cannot assume that choice, as
   understood by educated, affluent Westerners, is a universal aspiration.
   The meaning and significance of choice are cultural constructions.
   Moreover, even when choice can foster freedom, empowerment, and
   independence, it is not an unalloyed good. Too much choice can produce a
   paralyzing uncertainty, depression, and selfishness. In the United
   States, the path to well-being may require that we strike a balance
   between the positive and negative consequences of proliferating choice
   in every domain of life.

   healthy eating signals that the health goal was sufficiently met, and

   one's appetite. Accordingly, consumers asked to sample an item framed as
   healthy later reported being hungrier and consumed more food than those
   who sampled the same item framed as tasty or those who did not eat at
   all. These effects of healthy eating depend on the consumer's perception
   that healthy eating is mandatory; therefore, only imposed healthy eating

AB Narrative transportation-to be carried away by a story-has been proposed
   as a distinct route to persuasion. But as originally conceived,
   narrative transportation is unlikely to occur in response to
   advertisements, where persuasive intent is obvious and consumer
   resistance is expected. We analyze fashion ads to show how narrative
   transportation can nonetheless be a possible response to ads, if
   specific aesthetic properties are present, most notably when grotesque
   imagery is used. We then situate narrative transportation as one of five
   modes of engaging fashion advertising, each of which serves as a
   distinct route to persuasion. Interviews showed that consumers variously
   engage ads to act, identify, feel, transport, or immerse. We explain how
   aesthetic properties of ads call forth different modes of engagement and
   explore how grotesque imagery can lead to either narrative
   transportation or immersion. As routes to persuasion, transportation and
   immersion work by intensifying brand experience rather than boosting
   brand evaluation.

AB The choice overload hypothesis states that an increase in the number of
   options to choose from may lead to adverse consequences such as a
   decrease in the motivation to choose or the satisfaction with the
   finally chosen option. A number of studies found strong instances of
   choice overload in the lab and in the field, but others found no such
   effects or found that more choices may instead facilitate choice and
   increase satisfaction. In a meta-analysis of 63 conditions from 50
   published and unpublished experiments (N = 5,036), we found a mean
   effect size of virtually zero but considerable variance between studies.
   While further analyses indicated several potentially important
   preconditions for choice overload, no sufficient conditions could be
   identified. However, some idiosyncratic moderators proposed in single
   studies may still explain when and why choice overload reliably occurs;
   we review these studies and identify possible directions for future
   research.

   across all conditions and a single "sufficient" condition that is likely
   to solely predict this effect is not informative. Moreover, because
   prior research has documented multiple instances in which an abundance
   of options leads to choice overload, the interesting question is not
   whether choice overload occurs but when it occurs. The answer to this
   question is unlikely to stem from testing for the presence of a single
   main effect using the traditional meta-analytic approach. Instead,
   research would benefit from a theory-based meta-analysis that tests the
   validity of a conceptual model of choice overload capturing the
   underlying psychological processes.

AB For most forms of conscious consumer choice, product attributes serve as
   the means that consumers use to accomplish their goals. Because there is
   competition between products in the marketplace, consumption decisions
   typically present conflict between means to achieve a goal. In this
   article, we examine the consequences of conflict between regulatory
   means on consumers' decisions and show that its resolution depends on
   whether the means-that is, the attributes-are compatible with the
   consumer's regulatory orientation. We show that compatibility with more
   than one attribute arouses acute decision conflict and evokes decision
   processes that result in a pronounced tendency to make counternormative
   choices. We also show that incompatibility with a product's attributes
   leads to choosing extreme alternatives, which suggests the presence of a
   "pick-your-poison" effect. We test our hypotheses using the attraction,
   compromise, and deferral paradigms. We close by discussing our results
   in the context of the Lewinian view of decision conflict.

AB Consumers often gauge their own and others' preferences for products
   through social comparisons. This research examines the role of
   consumers' need for uniqueness (CNFU) in two common social comparisons:
   projection and introjection. Consumers project (i.e., rely on their own
   preferences to estimate those of others), regardless of their CNFU.
   However, high-CNFU consumers are less likely than low-CNFU ones to
   introject (i.e., rely on estimates of others' preferences to gauge their
   own). Moreover, alleviating the introjection-induced threat to the
   high-CNFU consumers' self-concept by having them deliberate on their
   differentness from others increases their likelihood of introjection.
   Together, these findings confirm our basic contention that the process
   underlying introjection is more motivational in nature than that
   underlying projection.

AB This research examines how construal level (i.e., how abstractly or

   responses to mixed emotions appeals. The results of five studies show
   that, consistent with prior research, participants experienced
   discomfort when they encountered mixed emotions appeals and developed
   less favorable attitudes toward the ad relative to pure positive
   emotional appeals, but this was the case only for those who construed
   information at a concrete, low level. Participants who construed
   information at an abstract, high level did not experience much
   discomfort; hence, they found mixed emotions and pure positive emotional
   appeals equally persuasive. We further demonstrate that the chronic
   construal level associated with people's age and cultural background
   underlies the moderating effects of age and culture on consumers'
   attitudes toward mixed emotions appeals documented in prior research.

AB Changing brand attitudes by pairing a brand with affectively laden
   stimuli such as celebrity endorsers or pleasant pictures is called
   evaluative conditioning. We show that this attitude change can occur in
   two ways, depending on how brands and affective stimuli are presented.
   Attitude change can result from establishing a memory link between brand
   and affective stimulus (indirect attitude change) or from direct "affect
   transfer" from affective stimulus to brand (direct attitude change).
   Direct attitude change is significantly more robust than indirect
   attitude change, for example, to changes in the valence of affective
   stimuli (unconditioned stimulus revaluation: e. g., endorsers falling
   from grace), to interference by subsequent information (e. g.,
   advertising clutter), and to persuasion knowledge activation (e. g.,
   consumer suspicion about being influenced). Indirect evaluative
   conditioning requires repeated presentations of a brand with the same
   affective stimulus. Direct evaluative conditioning requires simultaneous
   presentation of a brand with different affective stimuli.

AB How do changes in public discourse and regulatory structure affect the
   acceptance of a consumption practice? Previous research on legitimacy in
   consumer behavior has focused on the consumer reception of legitimizing
   discourse rather than on the historical process of legitimation itself.
   This study examines the influence of changes in the institutional
   environment over time on the meaning structures that influence consumer
   perception and practice. To study legitimation as a historical process,
   a discourse analysis of newspaper articles about casino gambling from
   1980-2007 was conducted. Results show that the regulatory approval of
   gambling is accompanied by a shift in the semantic categories used to
   discuss casinos and that journalists play a role in shaping these
   categories. Further, journalists shape the meaning of a consumption
   practice in three ways: through selection, validation, and realization.
   Interpreted through the lens of institutional theory, these findings
   suggest that studies of legitimation should consider changes in public
   discourse and legal regulation in addition to consumer perceptions of
   legitimacy.

   show how public space can be contested as private and commercialized, or
   offered back as a collective good, where sense of belonging and dialogue
   restore it to a meaningful place. We demonstrate how the common nature

   fit-extension relationship generalizes to scenarios that include
   relatively more or less familiar competitor brands. Support is found for
   this relationship in noncompetitive scenarios but is diminished by
   competitors' relative brand familiarity. Perceived risk mediates the

AB While theories of signaling and conspicuous consumption suggest that
   more explicit markers facilitate communication, this article examines
   the utility of subtle signals. Four studies demonstrate that while less
   explicit branding increases the likelihood of misidentification (e. g.,
   observers confusing a high-end purchase for a cheaper alternative),
   people with more cultural capital in a particular domain prefer subtle
   signals because they provide differentiation from the mainstream. Such
   insiders have the necessary connoisseurship to decode the meaning of
   subtle signals that facilitate communication with others "in the know."
   Consistent with the notion that these effects are driven by outward
   communication, they are stronger in identity-relevant product domains
   and situations where consumption is more public. This work highlights
   the communication value of less explicit signals and discusses the
   implications for branding, signal persistence, and the communication of
   identity.

AB Because consumers ask different questions to establish commitment at
   beginning versus advanced stages of goal pursuit, we propose that
   progress that they attribute to themselves and to the situation will
   have a distinctive impact on motivation, depending on their relative
   position in goal pursuit. When progress on achieving a goal is low,
   people are concerned about its attainability. Because attributing low
   progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a higher difficulty of
   goal attainment, it leads to lower goal commitment and, subsequently,
   decreased motivation. Conversely, when progress on achieving the goal is
   high and attainment of the goal is relatively secured, people are more
   concerned about the value of the goal. Because attributing a high
   progress to self (vs. to the situation) signals a greater value of the
   goal, it should lead to greater goal commitment and, subsequently,
   higher motivation.

AB When consumers use brands with appealing personalities, does the brand's
   personality "rub off" on them? The answer is yes, but only for consumers
   who hold certain beliefs about their personality. Entity theorists
   perceive themselves to be better looking, more feminine, and more
   glamorous after using a Victoria's Secret shopping bag (study 1) and
   more intelligent, more of a leader, and harder working after using an
   MIT pen (study 2); incremental theorists are unaffected. In two
   subsequent studies, we find that entity theorists use brands with
   appealing personalities to signal their positive qualities, thereby
   enhancing self-perceptions in line with the brand's personality. These
   findings implicate implicit self-theories as a key factor in
   understanding how brand experiences affect consumers.

AB This article examines how mainstream consumer thinking is structured in
   order to form opinions about consumer rights, government regulation, and
   individual responsibility in the credit card setting. A broader
   political ideology-one that intertwines consumption practices with a
   causal narrative of business, society, and state-infuses consumer
   opinions. The article finds that four sociohistorically shaped political
   myths compete in this ideological space: individual autonomy, social
   equality, consumer sovereignty, and corporate dominance. Consumers
   negotiate tensions between each of these four myths-for example,
   individual autonomy versus social equality, and consumer sovereignty
   versus corporate dominance. This ideology triggers moral judgments among
   consumers about self and others that inform their perceptions of
   deservedness and apportions degrees of responsibility and blame across
   consumer, business, and government participants.

AB We investigate the interfering influence of elevated arousal on the
   impact of positive mood on resistance to temptation. Three studies
   demonstrate that when a temptation activates long-term health goals,
   baseline positive mood facilitates resistance to temptation in (1) the
   choice between two snack items, one of which is more unhealthy, sinful,
   and hard to resist (M&Ms) than the other (grapes) and (2) the monitoring
   of consumption when the sinful option is chosen. However, this influence
   is attenuated when positive mood is accompanied by elevated arousal. We
   demonstrate that the cognitive depletion that accompanies elevated
   arousal interferes with the self-regulatory focus of positive mood,
   decreasing resistance to temptation.

AB After people incur costs to get future benefits, they usually track
   these costs in their mental accounts and are keen to receive the
   benefits when they become available. We introduce the notion that costs
   and benefits can occur either in the same accounting period (day,
   season, etc.) or in different periods. Our key argument is that monetary
   costs are tracked across accounting periods but that temporal costs are
   written off at the end of the period in which they are incurred. Thus,
   accounting periods lead to a time-money asymmetry in the tracking of
   costs and, consequently, in the likelihood of seeking benefits. In a
   laboratory study, an online-panel study, and a field study with
   movie-theater patrons, we demonstrate how this relationship among
   accounting periods, cost tracking, and benefit seeking is different for
   time than for money. Our findings offer insights into the sunk-cost
   effect, time-money differences, and mental accounting.

AB Increased liking of one's choice following difficult decisions (e. g.,
   choosing between similarly attractive options) is well documented. Given
   the common mechanism proposed for this effect-a highly involving
   dissonance reduction process-it would be reasonable to expect such
   choice enhancement to be quite durable and resistant to later change.
   Instead, we show the contrary: that difficulty-driven choice enhancement
   is exceptionally fragile, collapsing easily against even minor attack.
   In three experiments, consumers make easy or difficult product choices,
   report attitudes toward their choice, and subsequently encounter a
   negative customer review. Compared to easy decisions, difficult
   decisions lead to more extreme initial positivity toward chosen products
   but also to more vulnerability to subsequent attack. Moreover, this
   fragile enhancement effect is exacerbated, not ameliorated, by choice
   involvement. Thus, making difficult decisions between similarly
   attractive options may motivate a bubblelike inflation of positivity
   that has some semblance of strength yet remains highly prone to
   collapse.

   theoretical framework to describe how massed or spaced learning
   schedules interact with different learning styles to influence product
   usage proficiency. The core finding is that with experiential learning,
   proficiency in a product usage task is better under massed conditions,
   whereas with verbal learning, spacing works better. This effect is
   demonstrated for usage proficiency assessed via speed as well as quality
   of use. Further, massed learning also results in better usage
   proficiency on transfer tasks, for both experiential and verbal
   learning. We also find that massed learning in experiential learning
   conditions leads not only to better usage proficiency but also to
   positive perceptions of the product. Overall, the pattern of results is
   consistent with a conceptual mapping account, with massed experiences
   leading to a superior mental model of usage and thus to better usage

AB An important issue in consumer behavior is whether affect created by
   low-level processes, such as evaluative conditioning, will influence
   brand choice when consumers have also been exposed to relevant product
   information. To examine this issue, in two experiments implicit
   attitudes were created by evaluative conditioning where the participants
   were unaware of the contingencies. This creates an "I like it, but I
   don't know why" effect. The participants also had conflicting product
   information available in memory. We find that the participants rely on
   their implicit attributes when making a brand choice if they have not
   formed an explicit evaluation based on the product attribute
   information. This occurs even when the attribute information is
   available in memory and the participants are highly motivated to
   retrieve it. These findings provide evidence that implicit attitudes can
   have a significant influence on behavior, despite conflicting product
   information, and increased levels of motivation and opportunity.

   for alternatives at a more local level. Second, promotion-focused
   consumers tend to have larger consideration sets than do
   prevention-focused consumers. Building on these two primary findings, it
   is additionally shown that whereas promotion-focused consumers attach
   relatively greater value to options chosen from hierarchically
   structured sets, prevention-focused consumers attach relatively greater
   value to options chosen from nonhierarchically structured item lists.
   Finally, whereas promotion-focused consumers attach significantly
   greater value to options chosen from larger sets than to options chosen
   from smaller sets, prevention-focused consumers do not attach
   significantly less value to options chosen from larger sets than to

   perceptual and conceptual knowledge and posit that when these two types
   of knowledge are bridged with a sensory consumption vocabulary, the
   aficionados are better able to learn from their experiences. In
   experiment 1, we find that providing aficionados a cross-modal learning
   tool (wine aroma wheel) during their tasting helps them strengthen their
   experiential memory and withstand influence from misleading marketing
   communications. We also find that when aficionados are presented with a
   misleading consumption vocabulary during their tasting, they more
   readily accept the marketing misinformation that results in memory
   distortion. In experiment 2, we find that accurate multisensory
   information delivered through either the wine aroma wheel or advertising
   can enhance how aficionados learn from their direct tasting experience.

   predictions of such skill learning occurring in the initial
   skill-acquisition phase of product use. After initially trying new
   products, people underpredict how quickly they will acquire the skills
   required for product use. Further, we find that this underprediction of
   learning is due to a failure to appreciate how rapidly task experience
   leads to a shift from system 2 to system 1 processing. In six
   experiments, we document the effect, examine its generality across
   several tasks, and demonstrate its consequences for product devaluation
   and abandonment. We conclude with a discussion of implications for

AB Marketplace myths are commonly conceptualized as cultural resources that
   attract consumers to a consumption activity or brand. This theoretical
   orientation is prone to overstating the extent to which consumers'
   identity investments in a field of consumption are motivated by an
   associated marketplace myth. We provide a theoretical corrective to this
   tendency by investigating consumers who have become vested in a
   commercially mythologized consumption field through an incremental
   process of building social connections and cultural capital. For these
   consumers, the prevailing marketplace myth is experienced as a
   trivialization of their aesthetic interests, rather than as a source of
   identity value. In response, they employ demythologizing practices to
   insulate their acquired field-dependent social and cultural capital from
   devaluation. Our findings advance theorizations concerning marketplace
   myths and consumer identity work and explicate the sociocultural forces
   that deter consumers from abandoning a consumption field that has become
   culturally associated with undesirable meanings.

AB Choice confidence is affected by fluency and moderated by construal
   levels that evoke different theories to interpret the feelings of
   fluency. At lower construal levels, fluency informs the feasibility of
   completing the concrete steps of the decision process to choose well,
   but at higher construal levels, fluency informs (insufficient) effort
   invested for the desirability of the outcome. We manipulated fluency by
   varying the font of product descriptions or the number of thoughts we
   asked participants to recall. Our studies showed that fluency increased
   confidence for people processing at lower construal levels but decreased
   confidence for those processing at higher construal levels. Construal
   level does not affect the persuasiveness of consumers' thoughts,
   supporting the hypothesis that it is the interpretation of fluency
   experienced during judgment, not the thought content, that leads to the
   moderating effects of construal level.

AB Loyalty programs offer rewards via mediums of different magnitudes
   (e.g., "$6 off when you accumulate 1,000 [100] points. Earn 10 [1]
   points/dollar"). The program medium presents two key pieces of
   information: reward distance (points required to redeem reward) and step
   size (points earned per dollar). In higher-magnitude (vs.
   lower-magnitude) programs, both reward distances (1,000 vs. 100) and
   step sizes (10 vs. 1 point[s]/dollar) are larger. How do these two
   pieces of information affect consumers' postenrollment inferences of
   progress, store loyalty, and recommendation likelihood? Do consumers
   always integrate both pieces? We identify a moderator, step-size
   ambiguity, and show that when ambiguity is high, only reward distance
   affects inferences. When ambiguity is lower, consumers integrate step
   size with reward distance, but in a biased manner. Implications arise in
   goal following and in physical and psychological distance estimation
   contexts (e.g., weight loss, savings) where distances and step sizes can
   vary (e.g., as a function of units: kilograms vs. pounds), but

   external disadvantage, and passion and determination. We demonstrate
   that such a biography can increase purchase intentions, real choice, and
   brand loyalty. We argue that these biographies are effective because
   consumers react positively when they see the underdog aspects of their
   own lives being reflected in branded products. Four studies demonstrate
   that the underdog brand biography effect is driven by identity
   mechanisms: we show that the effect is (a) mediated by consumers'
   identification with the brand, (b) greater for consumers who strongly
   self-identify as underdogs, (c) stronger when consumers are purchasing

   suggests that sequential evaluations are subject to anchoring biases,
   such that the values of subsequently evaluated alternatives are
   assimilated toward the initially considered option. The present research
   argues, however, that sequential valuations often lead to contrast
   rather than assimilation effects, whereby values of the subsequently
   estimated alternatives are distanced from the initially evaluated
   option. These contrast effects are attributed to semantic anchoring,
   which stems from evaluating conceptually related options classified into
   opposing categories (e.g., vices and virtues).

AB How are price judgments influenced by the distribution of observed
   prices for other items in the same category? Processing goals will
   moderate price-judgment processes. When the processing goal is
   discrimination, price perceptions will be influenced by variations in
   range and ranks of prices in a distribution and contrast effects will be
   observed. For example, lowering the price of the lowest-priced product
   in a set will increase perceived expensiveness of higher-priced
   products. When the processing goal is generalization, however, price
   perceptions will be influenced by variations in the mean of the price
   distribution, in which case assimilation is observed. For example,
   lowering the price of the lowest-priced product in a set will decrease
   perceived expensiveness of higher-priced products. This latter finding
   is in sharp contrast to findings in the current literature on the effect
   of price structure on price judgments.

   central thesis, and a central finding of all four experiments, is that
   disclosure of private information is responsive to environmental cues
   that bear little connection, or are even inversely related, to objective
   hazards. We address underlying processes and rule out alternative
   explanations by eliciting subjective judgments of the sensitivity of
   inquiries (experiment 3) and by showing that the effect of cues
   diminishes if privacy concern is activated at the outset of the
   experiment (experiment 4). This research highlights consumer
   vulnerabilities in navigating increasingly complex privacy issues

AB We examine how consumers update their confidences in ordinal (relative)
   judgments while evaluating sequential product-ranking and
   source-accuracy data in percentage versus frequency formats. The results
   show that when sequential data are relatively easier to mathematically
   combine (e.g., percentage data), consumers revise their judgments in a
   way that is consistent with an averaging model but inconsistent with the
   normative Bayesian model. However, when the sequential data are
   difficult to mathematically combine (e.g., frequency data), consumers
   update their confidence judgments in a way that is more consistent with
   the normative Bayesian model than with an averaging model.
   Interestingly, greater processing motivation for sequential frequency
   data leads to updated confidence judgments that are lower than normative
   Bayesian predictions but consistent with the averaging model. Overall,
   the results of the experiments reveal counterintuitive findings; updated
   confidence judgments are higher and more accurate when sequential data
   are more difficult to process and also when consumers have lower
   processing motivation.

   For example, consumers sometimes choose to stay at freezing ice hotels
   and to eat at restaurants serving peculiar foods, such as bacon ice
   cream. We propose that such choices are driven by consumers' continual
   striving to use time productively, make progress, and reach
   accomplishments (i.e., a productivity orientation). We argue that
   choices of collectable (unusual, novel, extreme) experiences lead
   consumers to feel productive even when they are engaging in leisure
   activities as they "check off " items on an " experiential check list"
   and build their " experiential CV." A series of laboratory and field

   When people experienced malicious envy, the envy premium emerged for a

AB Five experiments demonstrate that brands cause priming effects (i.e.,
   behavioral effects consistent with those implied by the brand), whereas
   slogans cause reverse priming effects (i.e., behavioral effects opposite
   to those implied by the slogan). For instance, exposure to the retailer
   brand name "Walmart," typically associated with saving money, reduces
   subsequent spending, whereas exposure to the Walmart slogan, "Save
   money. Live better," increases it. Slogans cause reverse priming effects
   and brands cause priming effects because people perceive slogans, but
   not brands, as persuasion tactics. The reverse priming effect is driven
   by a nonconscious goal to correct for bias and can occur without any
   conscious mediation (i.e., following subliminal exposure to the word
   "slogan"). These findings provide evidence that consumer resistance to
   persuasion can be driven by processes that operate entirely outside
   conscious awareness.

AB This research examines how consumers' spending on themselves versus
   others can be affected by temporary shifts in their states of power.
   Five experiments found that individuals experiencing a state of power
   spent more money on themselves than on others, whereas those
   experiencing a state of powerlessness spent more money on others than on
   themselves. This effect was observed using a variety of power
   manipulations (hierarchical roles, print advertisements, episodic
   recall, and mental role-playing), across spending intentions and actual
   dollars spent, and among college and national samples. We propose that
   this effect occurs because power and powerlessness affect the
   psychological utility of self versus others, and this in turn affects
   the monetary worth allocated to spending on self versus others. The
   research makes novel contributions to appreciating how the spending on
   the self versus others varies as a function of psychological states and
   increases our understanding of the role of power in consumer behavior.

AB Size labels adopted by food vendors can have a major impact on size

   integrate the actual size information from the stimuli with the semantic
   cue from the size label. Size labels influence not only size perception
   and actual consumption, they also affect perceived consumption. Size
   labels can also result in relative perceived size reversals, so that
   consumers deem a smaller package to be bigger than a larger one.
   Further, consumers are more likely to believe a label that professes an
   item to be smaller (vs. larger) in the size range associated with that
   item. This asymmetric effect of size labels can result in larger
   consumption without the consumer even being aware of it ("guiltless

   and show increased desire to attend social gatherings. Building on the
   evolutionary logic behind such effects, we examined how, why, and when
   hormonal fluctuations associated with ovulation influenced women's
   product choices. In three experiments, we show that at peak fertility
   women nonconsciously choose products that enhance appearance (e.g.,
   choosing sexy rather than more conservative clothing). This hormonally
   regulated effect appears to be driven by a desire to outdo attractive
   rival women. Consequently, minimizing the salience of attractive women
   who are potential rivals suppresses the ovulatory effect on product
   choice. This research provides some of the first evidence of how, why,
   and when consumer behavior is influenced by hormonal factors.

   of previously unexplored heritable effects on consumer choices and
   judgments. Moreover, whereas prior research on heritable traits has
   typically employed a piecemeal approach, demonstrating each heritable
   trait separately, we propose an alternative way to simultaneously
   explore common mechanisms and links among heritable traits and
   behaviors. Using a classic twins study design, we find a large heritable
   effect on preferences for (a) compromise (but not dominating) options,
   (b) sure gains, (c) an upcoming feasible, dull assignment, (d)
   maximizing, (e) utilitarian options, and (f) certain products.
   Conversely, we do not find significant heritable effects regarding
   judgment heuristics, discounting, and other decision problems. We
   tentatively propose that the pattern of findings might reflect a generic
   heritable individual difference relating to "prudence." We discuss the
   implications of our research with respect to the determinants of
   preferences and future research on heritable aspects of judgment and
   choice.

   outcomes, the option valence, and whether the externally made choice was
   determined by an expert or at random. Results show that the outcome of a
   self-made choice is more satisfying than the outcome of an externally
   made choice when the goal is hedonic but not when it is utilitarian. We
   hypothesize that this effect results from the greater perceived personal

   hedonic choices, relative to instrumentally motivated activities, such
   as utilitarian choices, and provide evidence that supports this

AB When considering the purchase of a new product, will consumers be more
   likely to make the purchase if they think about using it every day or if
   they think about using it every week? From an economic perspective,
   using a durable product more frequently should increase its perceived
   value. However, we show that perceived usage frequency relative to other
   consumers can influence product interest more than absolute usage
   frequency. In five studies, we use scale labels, advertisements, and
   customer reviews to invoke either a high-frequency or low-frequency
   norm. We show that high-frequency cues create less product interest and
   lower willingness to pay than low-frequency cues because consumers infer
   that their relative usage frequency will be lower, reducing the
   product's perceived fit. This effect is moderated by the consumer's
   perceived similarity to the standard of comparison and the consumer's
   own characteristics.

   is important to know whether some kinds of judgments may lead the crowd
   astray, whether crowds' judgments improve with feedback over time, and
   whether crowds' judgments can be improved by changing the way judgments
   are elicited. We investigated these questions in a sports gambling
   context (predictions against point spreads) believed to elicit crowd
   wisdom. In a season-long experiment, fans wagered over $20,000 on NFL
   football predictions. Contrary to the wisdom-of-crowds hypothesis,
   faulty intuitions led the crowd to predict "favorites" more than
   "underdogs" against point spreads that disadvantaged favorites, even
   when bettors knew that the spreads disadvantaged favorites. Moreover,
   the bias increased over time, a result consistent with attributions for
   success and failure that rewarded intuitive choosing. However, when the
   crowd predicted game outcomes by estimating point differentials rather
   than by predicting against point spreads, its predictions were unbiased
   and wiser.

   As a consequence, the shift from a number to zero can make an advantage
   (or disadvantage) that seemed large and clear in the presence of a
   reference point become less clear and thus less impactful when a
   reference point is removed. This leads to an interesting effect, whereby
   an option can improve its choice share by increasing the level of an
   undesirable attribute from zero or decreasing the level of a desirable
   attribute to zero. A series of four experiments provide supporting
   evidence for this new choice phenomenon.

AB It is widely believed that increasing the equality of material
   possessions or income in a social group should lead people at the bottom
   of the distribution to consume less and save more. However, this
   prediction and its causal mechanism have never been studied
   experimentally. Five studies show that greater equality increases the
   satisfaction of those in the lowest tier of the distribution because it
   reduces the possession gap between what they have and what others have.
   However, greater equality also increases the position gains derived from
   status-enhancing consumption, since it allows low-tier consumers to get
   ahead of the higher proportion of consumers clustered in the middle
   tiers. As a result, greater equality reduces consumption when consumers
   focus on the narrower possession gap, but it increases consumption when
   they focus on the greater position gains (i.e., when consumption is
   conspicuous, social competition goals are primed, and the environment is
   competitive).

AB Researchers have analyzed various forms of extraordinary consumption
   experiences, using Victor Turner's conceptualization of antistructure
   with a particular focus on their rather romantic and communal aspects.
   While such a focus contributed greatly to our understanding of these
   experiences, it also resulted in overlooking much of their individuated
   characteristics such as boundaries, conflicts, competition, and
   positional struggles at the interpersonal level. This ethnographic study
   of commercialized climbing expeditions on Everest provides significant
   evidence that participants negotiate and manage various marketplace
   tensions within an individual performance ideology. Our study challenges
   quixotic use of Turner's antistructure-structure dichotomy and extends
   it such that extraordinary experiences, when bought in the marketplace,
   can be very individualistic and competitive as opposed to being
   conducive to feelings of community and liminal camaraderie.

AB Consumers are often strongly motivated to view themselves as part of a
   legitimate and fair external system. Our research focuses on how
   individuals adopt distinct ways of defending their system when it is
   threatened and, in particular, how this is revealed in their consumption
   choices. We find that although individuals differ in how confident they
   are in the legitimacy of their system, they do not differ in their
   motivation to defend the system when it is threatened. Instead, they
   simply adopt different methods of defense. Specifically, when an
   important system is (verbally) attacked, individuals who are the least
   confident in the legitimacy of the system seek and appreciate
   consumption choices that allow them to indirectly and subtly defend the
   system. Conversely, individuals who are highly confident in the system
   reject indirect opportunities of defense and seek consumption choices
   that allow them to defend the system in direct and explicit ways.

AB In the present article, we propose that consumers' initial effort
   investment in pursuing a goal may increase or decrease the value of the
   goal and the consumer's subsequent motivation, depending on whether the
   pursuit of the goal is perceived to be one's autonomous choice. When
   consumers perceive that the goal they pursue is adopted through an
   autonomous choice, the initial effort investment is experienced as
   reflecting the value of the goal; therefore, greater effort should
   increase the value of the goal as well as consumers' subsequent
   motivation. Conversely, if consumers perceive that the goal has been
   imposed on them, they experience psychological reactance that is
   proportional to the amount of effort that they expend in pursuing the
   goal; thus, they devalue the goal as they invest more effort in its
   pursuit and show lower subsequent motivation.

   perceive higher risk in playing a slot machine (study 1) and in getting
   skin cancer (study 2) when the risk-bearing entities (the slot machine
   and skin cancer) are highly anthropomorphized. In contrast, those with
   high power perceive greater risk when the entities are less
   anthropomorphized. We hypothesize these effects occur because those with
   high (low) power perceived a greater (lesser) degree of control over the
   anthropomorphized entity. In study 3, we investigate the reverse effect
   that higher perceived risk may increase anthropomorphism for people with
   low power but decrease anthropomorphism for people with high power.

AB This article extends theory around consumer-brand relationship quality
   by exploring conditions under which such relationships may be
   transformed into exceptionally negative dispositions toward once-coveted
   brands. Survey and experimental results indicate that the more
   self-relevant a consumer-brand relationship, the more likely are
   anti-brand retaliatory behaviors after the relationship ends. These
   anti-brand behaviors are diverse: from complaining to third parties, to
   negative word of mouth, to illegal actions such as theft, threats, and
   vandalism. In contrast, post-exit consumer-brand relationships that were
   low in self-relevance but were high in trust, commitment, and
   satisfaction are less likely to result in anti-brand actions. The role
   of a discrete product or service failure is also explored, and results
   suggest that self-relevance may motivate retaliation even in the absence
   of a so-called critical incident. Ultimately, this research illuminates
   previously unexplored mechanisms-including self-conscious emotional
   reactions-that motivate consumer hostility and retaliation.

AB Some food items that are commonly considered unhealthy also tend to
   elicit impulsive responses. The pain of paying in cash can curb
   impulsive urges to purchase such unhealthy food products. Credit card
   payments, in contrast, are relatively painless and weaken impulse
   control. Consequently, consumers are more likely to buy unhealthy food
   products when they pay by credit card than when they pay in cash.
   Results from four studies support these hypotheses. Analysis of actual
   shopping behavior of 1,000 households over a period of 6 months revealed
   that shopping baskets have a larger proportion of food items rated as
   impulsive and unhealthy when shoppers use credit or debit cards to pay
   for the purchases (study 1). Follow-up experiments (studies 2-4) show
   that the vice-regulation effect of cash payments is mediated by pain of
   payment and moderated by chronic sensitivity to pain of payment.
   Implications for consumer welfare and theories of impulsive consumption

AB Consumers often face decisions about whether to purchase products that
   are intended to protect them from possible harm. However, safety
   products rarely provide perfect protection and sometimes "betray"
   consumers by causing the very harm they are intended to prevent.
   Examples include vaccines that may cause disease and air bags that may
   explode with such force that they cause death. Expanding research on
   betrayal aversion, this study examines the role of emotions in
   consumers' tendency to choose safety options that provide less overall
   protection in order to eliminate a very small probability of harm due to
   safety product betrayal. In five studies we find that betrayal aversion
   is reduced and safer alternatives are selected when factors that dampen
   the emotional response to potential betrayals are introduced or taken
   into account. These factors include changing the betrayal from an action
   to an omission (study 1), introducing positive imagery (study 2),
   introducing visual representations of risk (study 3), making the
   decision for another rather than oneself (study 4), and intuitive
   thinking style (study 5).

AB This research examines the largely unexamined effect of incidental pride
   on consumer self-control. The results demonstrate that incidental pride
   influences long-term goal pursuit through dual processes that result in
   conflicting outcomes for consumer decisions: indulgent choices when
   promoting a sense of achievement and virtuous choices when promoting
   self-awareness. A series of four experiments in the money and health
   domains shows that the relative weight of each process at the time of a
   decision determines whether incidental pride leads to more or less
   indulgence. We provide outcome and process support for our theory,
   linking pride to self-control behavior in the consumption domain, and
   rule out alternative explanations for our findings. Thus, the findings
   demonstrate that the influence of incidental pride on self-control is
   contingent on the cognitive and contextual factors that affect decision
   making.

AB Prior research has established that consumers are motivated to purchase

   an important consumer context, gift giving, in which individuals may
   make product choices that run counter to their own identities in order
   to fulfill the desires of the intended recipient. We find that
   purchasing an identity-contrary gift for a close (vs. distant) friend
   who is an integral part of the self can itself cause an identity threat
   to the giver. Four experiments in a gift registry context show that
   after making an identity-contrary gift choice for a close (vs. distant)
   friend, givers subsequently engage in behaviors that reestablish their
   identity such as indicating greater identity affiliation with the
   threatened identity and greater likelihood to purchase
   identity-expressive products. This research highlights the opposing
   forces that product purchase may exert on consumer identity as both a
   potential threat and means of self-verification.

   secondary over primary attributes, and choose products framed in a
   proximal rather than distal perspective. Process measures suggest that
   these effects occur because depletion from self-control heightens one's

   construals diminishes these effects. These findings offer insight into

   serial killers and notorious dictators? The present studies examine
   three potential explanations: mere associations, market demands, and
   contagion (the belief that these objects contain some remnants of their
   previous owners). Results indicate that while market demands do play a
   role, contagion appears to be the critical factor affecting the
   valuation of celebrity possessions. Manipulating the degree of physical
   contact that a celebrity has with an object dramatically influences
   consumers' willingness to purchase it, and individual differences in
   sensitivity to contagion moderate this effect. Additionally, the
   valuation of celebrity possessions is principally explained by measures
   of contagion, and subliminally activating the concept of contagion
   changes consumers' willingness to purchase celebrity objects.
   Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

   ordering structures that put children with different names in different

   typically at the end of lines, they compensate by responding quickly to
   acquisition opportunities. In addition to responding quicker, we find

AB Quantitative information can appear in different units (e. g., 7-year

   differences appear larger on scales with a higher number of units;
   expressing quality information on such an expanded scale makes consumers
   switch to a higher-quality option. Testifying to its practical
   importance, expressing the energy content of snacks in kilojoules rather
   than kilocalories increases the choice of a healthy snack. The unit
   effect occurs because consumers focus on the number rather than the type
   of units in which information is expressed (numerosity effect).
   Therefore, reminding consumers of alternative units in which information
   can be expressed eliminates the unit effect. Finally, the unit effect
   moderates relative thinking: consumers are more sensitive to relative
   attribute differences when the attribute is expressed on expanded
   scales. The relation with anchoring and implications for temporal

AB Our treatment of material possession love expands an understanding of
   the role that discrete emotional attachment forms play in identifying
   commercial value for marketers and in enhancing consumer well-being.
   Employing a mixed-methods research design-relying on both qualitative
   and quantitative data-we develop and empirically test a three-factor,
   but seven-faceted, conceptualization of material possession love in four
   separate consumption contexts (automobiles, computers, bicycles, and
   firearms). We find love-smitten consumers nurturing their beloved
   possessions, in part, by buying complementary products and services. We
   also find that material possession love is empirically tied to
   loneliness and social affiliation deficits, which suggests a
   compensatory basis of consumer well-being. We distinguish possession
   love from the construct of attitude and empirically demonstrate the
   distinct functionality of each. Our concluding discussion considers our
   mixed-methods findings and their implications for consumer research.

AB How do consumers react when they believe that a transaction partner will
   view them through the lens of a stereotype? We predicted and found that
   being aware of a negative stereotype about a group to which one belongs
   (e. g., gender) made consumers sensitive to whether service providers
   were in-group versus out-group members and lowered purchase intentions
   when the provider was an out-group member. We observed stereotype threat
   effects across diverse marketplace settings: financial services
   (experiment 1), automobile repairs (experiment 2), and automobile
   purchases (experiment 3). Furthermore, we found that reluctance to
   purchase from out-group (vs. in-group) members was caused by heightened
   anxiety. The presence of a soothing scent, as a situational factor to
   alleviate anxiety, mitigated stereotype threat effects on marketplace
   decisions.

AB Evidence from three experiments shows that due to superior visuo-spatial
   elaboration, females (relative to males) have a heightened ability to
   identify visually incongruent products that are promoted among competing
   products. Females discriminate relational information among competing
   advertisements and use this information to identify incongruent products
   that would otherwise go unidentified. Consequently, they evaluate the
   products more favorably. Consistent with predictions of a limited
   capacity in working memory, we find this performance for females
   coincides with a reduction in ad claim recognition. Close inspection
   reveals the trade-off between product identification and ad recognition
   is the result of involuntary resource allocation from verbal processing
   to visuo-spatial processing. Hence, females may be able to use the
   advertising context to identify an extremely incongruent product, but
   this performance is not without a cost. Our results have important
   implications for research on product incongruity, gender, and
   advertising context.

AB Drawing on construal level theory, this research proposes that

   for making quality inferences will be enhanced when the judgment is
   psychologically distant (vs. close). For example, the impact of price
   (attributes) on quality inferences should increase (decrease) when these
   inferences are made with regard to another person rather than oneself. A
   series of experiments provides support for this thesis. In addition, we
   (a) document a theoretically derived reversal of the core pattern, (b)
   reconcile the current findings with seemingly opposed results in the
   construal literature, and (c) rule out several alternative explanations
   for the obtained effects. The insights obtained in this work enrich our

AB This research explores the impact of merely altering the name of a food
   on dieters' and nondieters' evaluations of the food's healthfulness and
   taste, as well as consumption. Four studies demonstrate that when a food
   is identified by a relatively unhealthy name (e. g., pasta), dieters
   perceive the item to be less healthful and less tasty than do
   nondieters. When the identical food is assigned a relatively healthy
   name (e. g., salad), however, dieting tendency has no effect on product
   evaluations. This effect, which results in differences in actual food
   consumption, is explained by nondieters' insensitivity to food cues as
   well as dieters' reliance on cues indicating a lack of healthfulness and
   tendency to employ heuristic information processing when evaluating
   foods. These findings contribute to the body of literature that explores
   both individual and contextual factors that influence food evaluation

AB People often estimate how they compare to other consumers when they make
   purchase decisions. Unfortunately, they tend to err in this task, and
   this can lead to negative consequences in their choices. Previous
   literature has largely argued that these errors in estimates of relative
   standing are due to underweighting or ignoring the reference group.
   Using a novel measure of people's perception of the reference group, we
   show that consumers do attend to that information but err in their
   estimates of relative standing because they tend to overestimate the
   dispersion of others' performances and attributes. Three studies support
   this argument and provide insights that enable marketers to alter
   consumers' relative assessment process in formerly discounted ways. We
   demonstrate straightforward tools that can change consumers' impressions
   of others and thus change relative assessments and purchase decisions.

AB Does asking people about their future behavior increase or decrease the

   and two field experiments, we find that behavior prediction strengthens
   behavior repetition, making people more likely to do what they normally
   do, when personal norms regarding engaging in a behavior are weak or not
   easily accessible. However, when personal norms are strong or made
   accessible at the time of the prediction request, behavior prediction
   weakens behavior repetition and increases the likelihood that people do
   what they think they should do-even if it's not what they normally would
   do. These findings provide new tools for influencing behavior
   repetition, reconcile some seemingly contradictory past findings, and

AB This research investigates the effect of activation of a negative
   stereotype on behaviors that are perceived to increase the chance of
   becoming a member of the stereotyped group. Activation of a negative
   stereotype (the overweight stereotype) is shown to lead to
   stereotype-consistent goal commitment (low health goal commitment),
   which partially explains increases in stereotype-conducive behavior
   (eating indulgent foods). Two theoretically relevant moderators are
   proposed and supported. Increased accessibility of the countervailing
   health goal and increased accessibility of the link between the behavior
   and membership in the stereotyped group both limit the effect of
   stereotype activation on stereotype-conducive behavior. Five experiments
   support the facilitative effect of stereotype activation on
   stereotype-conducive behavior, the role of goal commitment, and both
   moderators.

AB How much time do consumers predict they will spend on using a product or

   their predicted consumption time is systematically influenced by the

   show that consumers predict spending more time on a pleasant event when
   it is unpacked into several subactivities and spending less time on an
   unpleasant event when it is unpacked. We also investigate the underlying
   mechanism and demonstrate that (1) people have a lay belief that they
   spend more (less) time on more (less) pleasant events and (2) unpacking
   increases the intensity of predicted consumption experience. We further
   show that these changes in time predictions influence consumption
   decisions and address alternative explanations, including mood, mood
   regulation, and attention. In closing, we discuss theoretical and
   managerial implications.

AB Evidence from four studies shows that signing one's name influences

   general self-identity prime that facilitates the activation of the

   situation, resulting in behavior congruent with that aspect. Our
   findings demonstrate that signing causes consumers to become more (less)

   in(out)-groups (study 3), and to conform more with (diverge more from)

AB When evaluating a product, consumers may interpret price information as
   either an indicator of quality or an indicator of monetary sacrifice. On
   the basis of construal level theory, we propose that psychological
   distance alters the weight consumers attach to these opposing roles of
   price. Four experiments show (1) that from both a temporally and a
   socially distant perspective, the price-perceived quality relationship
   is more pronounced; (2) that from a temporally proximal perspective, the
   price-perceived sacrifice relationship is more pronounced; (3) that
   these effects stem from differences in the way consumers mentally
   construe price information; and (4) that when people initially use price
   to judge a product for distant future consumption, it receives less
   attention as an indicator of sacrifice in a later evaluation for near
   future consumption. These findings have implications for prelaunch

AB Although positive affect may enhance self-control, some research
   suggests that this is not always the case. To clarify this relationship,
   we investigate the role of temporal focus on the effect of specific
   positive emotions on self-control dilemmas in snack consumption. In four
   studies, we demonstrate that participants experiencing a future-focused
   positive emotion (i.e., hopefulness) consume less unhealthy food and
   have lower preferences for unhealthy snacks than those in a past-or
   present-focused emotional state (i.e., pride, happiness). We demonstrate
   the role of temporal focus through its natural occurrence in
   emotion-induction essays (study 1), chronic temporal focus (study 2),
   and manipulation of anticipated versus retrospective emotional states
   (study 3). A fourth study demonstrates that self-control benefits do not
   arise from future-focused negative emotions (i.e., fear) as they do from
   future-focused positive emotions. These results suggest that consumers
   may benefit from adapting the temporal focus of positive emotions to the

   duration of the episodes or not and then experience either negative or
   positive episodes. The results show that, contrary to general intuition,
   duration knowledge worsens negative experiences and enhances positive
   experiences. In experiments 3a and 3b, we identify a boundary condition
   wherein the effect of duration knowledge is attenuated when participants

   research adds to this growing literature by showing how experts can fall
   prey to a different type of false memory when making product
   comparisons. Four studies demonstrate that in a product comparison
   context, in their attempt to make options more comparable, experts
   inadvertently "fill in the gap" by aligning nonalignable features in
   memory. This results in the false recall of aligned features that did
   not appear in the original descriptions. Experts' higher sense of

AB Although it is well known that advertising can momentarily activate
   specific consumer identities and thereby influence preference for
   identity-relevant products, the influence of such identity activation on
   consumer memory is undocumented. Identity activation encourages
   consumers to link advertising content to their identity during encoding,
   and these links facilitate subsequent recognition if the identity is
   again activated at retrieval. This identity-dependent processing
   produces different recognition outcomes for information that is strongly
   related, moderately related, and unrelated to the identity. Identity
   activation at both encoding and retrieval improved recognition of
   advertising content moderately related to the identity but had no effect
   on recognition of unrelated content. Identity activation at retrieval
   improved recognition of strongly related content, regardless of whether
   identity was primed externally at encoding. These results support an
   interpretative frame process at encoding and suggest that content-state
   association is a critical moderator of state-dependent learning.

   likelihood of retrieval are functions of category structures in memory.
   For a given resource, some uses are more typical of the category of

   attempting to lose weight reveals how they adopt practices imbued with

   in suturing the meaning patterns to particular subject positions in
   constituting themselves as consumers. Theoretical contributions (1)
   distinguish consumers' collaborative production of cultural meanings
   with friends, family, and others in the social domain and with financial
   agents and institutions in the market domain and (2) document the
   productive capacities of these meanings in patterns and trajectories in
   configuring people as consuming subjects. Implications situate such
   cultural reproduction processes in the United States in discussing how
   the national legacy of abundance informs the normalization of

AB For sports fans, great games are the close ones-those between evenly
   matched opponents, where the game remains undecided until the very end.
   However, the dark side to sporting events is the incidence of traffic
   fatalities due to game-related drinking. Here, we ask whether the
   closeness of the game affects the number of fatalities that occur. Two
   opposing predictions can be made. Games that are not close ("blowouts")
   may be less engaging, thus increasing drinking. Alternatively, close
   games may be more dangerous, increasing competition-associated
   testosterone that spills over into aggressive driving. An analysis of
   major sporting events (2001-8) shows that closer games are significantly
   correlated with more fatalities. Importantly, increased fatalities are
   observed only in locations with winning fans (game site and/or winners'
   hometown), congruent with a testosterone-based account. Ultimately, this
   finding has material consequences for public welfare on game days and
   suggests that one silver lining for losing fans may be a safer drive
   home.

AB It is self-evident that performing poorly on a task makes people
   dissatisfied relative to performing well. How can this negative affect
   be overcome? We provide an adaptive strategy for dealing with poor
   performance. Experiment 1 shows that poor performers tend to recruit the
   highest potential performance as a comparison standard and hence are
   dissatisfied. However, if they are reminded that they set their own low
   goals, and that these goals were met, they are as satisfied as better
   performers. Experiment 2 shows that incremental theorists who believe
   that they can improve their performance in the future tend to compare
   their performance to the initially set goal rather than the highest
   potential performance, and are hence as satisfied as better performers.
   These findings shed light on the dynamic comparison process underlying
   satisfaction judgment. Implications of these findings for perennial low
   goal setters and for satisfaction in general are discussed.

AB This article takes a consumer behavior perspective to investigate how
   constituents come to identify with organizations. Using longitudinal and
   cross-sectional interview data collected in two contexts (one consumer
   and one employee), the data illustrate that constituents engage with two
   conduits, one formal and one informal. These conduits provide
   opportunities for sensegiving, which features normative elements
   particular to an organization, and sensemaking, an integrative process
   in which productive consumption plays a key role. Three paths (epiphany,
   emulation, and exploration) leading from these conduits to
   identification are defined and explored. Second, this article reveals
   dynamic consequences of identification for both customer and employee
   constituents, including changes in their consumer values and behaviors
   extending beyond organizational concerns. Finally, this article defends
   the merit of softening hard conceptual distinctions drawn between
   consumers and employees, as the findings show that identification forms
   in parallel fashion with similar outcomes across a consumer-to-firm and
   an employee-to-firm context.

   results demonstrate that when distinctiveness concerns are heightened,
   greater dissociation responses (i.e., possession disposal intentions,
   recustomization behaviors, and exchange behaviors) arise in response to
   being mimicked by a similar as opposed to dissimilar other. These
   effects are driven by threats to distinctiveness. Finally, these effects
   are mitigated when the imitated possession is nonsymbolic in nature and
   when a low degree of effort is exerted to initially obtain the
   possession. Implications for marketers and consumers are discussed.

   consumers in a negative affective state experience enhanced sensitivity
   to the tactile benefits of products, whereas consumers in a positive
   affective state experience enhanced sensitivity to the visual benefits
   of products. Affect-based sensory sensitivity is a consequence of
   adaptations that induce mammals to seek social support when in a

AB Companies typically use clear fonts and bright pictures in their ads,
   Web sites, and product-package designs; place their products on
   easy-to-reach shelves; and emphasize ease-of-usage to make their
   products appear desirable to consumers. However, we suggest that
   customers focused on "incentive" value (getting the best product) may
   instead see products associated with noninstrumental (pointless) effort
   as more desirable. We suggest that because effort is usually required to
   get the best outcomes, people looking for the best outcomes also
   mistakenly presume effort must imply the best possible outcome. Across
   five studies, we show that highlighting incentive value-for instance, by
   message framing or by measuring chronic focus or by manipulating
   situational focus on incentive value-enhances preference toward outcomes
   associated with noninstrumental effort. We discuss the importance of our
   findings for understanding everyday consumption decisions and argue for
   a widespread tendency among individuals wanting the best to infer value

   Several experiments demonstrate that when personal control is

AB The past three decades have seen considerable debate about affect's

   incidental, integral, and cognitively based affect, positive affect
   results in more efficient processing while negative affect appears to
   make judgments both less efficient and more effortful. Affect's
   influence is inferred from the consistency of participants' responses
   and the pattern of the positive-negative response latency asymmetry
   reported by Herr and Page, in which positive judgments appear to be
   relatively effortless and automatic while negative judgments require
   effortful and controlled processing. Positive affect reduced or
   eliminated the asymmetry while negative affect exacerbated it. Affect's
   influence appears consistent with a view of positive affect-induced
   processing efficiency.

   into the unique factors present in a restaurant consumption setting (e.
   g., diners have a well-defined goal of hunger satiation because they
   invest effort by visiting a specific restaurant, choose from a menu, and

AB Consumer researchers have commonly analyzed marketplace performances as
   liminal events structured by context-specific role playing, norms of
   reciprocity, and cocreative collaborations. As a consequence, this
   literature remains theoretically mute on questions related to the
   sociological disparities that arise when marketplace performances forge
   relationships between affluent consumers and under-class service
   workers: a circumstance becoming increasingly commonplace owing to
   trends in the service-oriented global economy. To redress this gap, we
   analyze how such sociocultural differences are manifested and mediated
   in the provisions of skilled marketplace performances. Building upon
   Bourdieu's logic of field analysis, our resulting theoretical framework
   illuminates a network of structural relations that reconfigures the
   asymmetrical distribution of class-based resources between these class
   factions. Rather than being cooperative endeavors conducive to the
   formation of commercial friendships, we show that these class-stratified
   marketplace performances produce interdependent status games, subtly
   manifested power struggles, and contested forms of symbolic capital.

   and (2) the consumer must also be actively consuming (i.e., wearing) the

   term the attribute carryover effect. A series of three experiments
   demonstrate that a phased choice process can shift attribute
   preferences. If the top choice is unavailable, consumers with weak
   attribute preferences are likely to reject their explicitly identified
   second choice (the runner-up option). Instead, these consumers choose an
   option that may not meet the initial screening criteria but that does
   share a desirable, "differentiating" feature with the unavailable top
   choice. Judgment data indicate that this preference reversal is due to
   increased salience of the differentiating attribute during the last
   phase of the original choice, which "carries over" into the subsequent
   choice. These findings augment our understanding of consumer choice
   processes and heighten our ability to predict choice outcomes under

AB Scholars apply the relationship metaphor as a default conceptual lens to
   understand commercial interactions. Yet whereas the relationship
   paradigm sheds light on how the socially embedded structure of these
   interactions impacts their outcomes, the relationship metaphor can also
   obscure scholarly understanding of business buyers' experiences. Results
   of an interpretive study drawing on depth interviews demonstrate that
   buyers' colloquial use of "relationship" language is ubiquitous.
   However, buyers' narratives reveal instrumentally saturated emic
   meanings and felt tensions for the notion of expressive relationships
   with suppliers, which manifest deep conceptual friction with the
   constellation of etic relationship properties and constructs used by
   scholars to explain business interactions. Using Bauman's sociological
   commentary on liquid modernity, analyses indicate that framing these
   interactions as "connections" is a more theoretically congruent lens for
   viewing buyers' experiences. Implications for understanding buyers'
   desire for relational bonds and recasting ironic "dark side" research
   findings offer challenges for relationship marketing research.

AB Results from four studies uncover a relatively automatic cultural
   congruency mechanism that can influence evaluations of culturally
   charged brand extensions, overriding the impact of perceived fit on
   extension evaluations. Culturally congruent extensions (i.e., when both
   the brand and the extension category cue the same cultural schema) were
   evaluated more favorably than culturally neutral extensions, which in
   turn were evaluated more favorably than culturally incongruent ones
   (i.e., cue two different cultural schemas). The effects emerged with
   both moderate and low fit brand extensions, as well as for narrow and
   broad brands. However, they only emerged when both the brand and the
   product were culturally symbolic, likely to automatically activate a
   cultural schema but did not emerge for brands low in cultural symbolism.
   The effects were driven by the processing (dis) fluency generated by the
   simultaneous activation of the same (different) cultural schemas by the
   product and the brand.

AB Although the idea of brand concepts has been around for a while, very
   little research addresses how brand concepts may influence consumer
   responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Four
   studies reveal that communicating the CSR actions of a luxury brand
   concept causes a decline in evaluations, relative to control. A luxury
   brand's self-enhancement concept (i.e., dominance over people and
   resources) is in conflict with the CSR information's self-transcendence
   concept (i.e., protecting the welfare of all), which causes disfluency
   and a decline in evaluations. These effects do not emerge for brands
   with openness (i.e., following emotional pursuits in uncertain
   directions) or conservation (i.e., protecting the status quo) concepts
   that do not conflict with CSR. The effects for luxury brand concepts
   disappeared when the informativeness of the disfluency was undermined
   but were accentuated in an abstract (vs. concrete) mind-set. These
   findings implicate brand concepts as a key factor in how consumers
   respond to CSR activities.

AB Ample research shows that consumers accept influence from a source they
   identify with and reject influence from a source they wish to dissociate
   from. The current article moves beyond the well-established
   identification principle and delineates a new influence process.
   Influence via comparison-driven self-evaluation and restoration (CDSER)
   takes place when one observes a counterstereotypical product user and,
   as a result, questions one's relative standing on the trait that the
   product symbolizes. In response to this threatening self-evaluation, the
   observer becomes more interested in the target product. To clearly
   distinguish CDSER from identification influence, the current
   investigation focuses on product users with a low socioeconomic status
   (SES). In contrast to the predictions of the identification principle,
   this article demonstrates that low-SES users can in some circumstances
   positively influence observers and increase their purchase intentions.
   The "low-status user effect" and the CDSER mechanism are demonstrated
   across multiple product categories in four studies.

AB Delaying the presentation of some favorable information about an
   alternative (e. g., a product, service, brand, store, or cause) until
   after consumers have completed their pre-choice screening can increase
   that alternative's choice share. While such a delay reduces the
   alternative's chance of surviving the screening, it can actually
   increase its probability of ultimately being chosen. Evidence from five
   experiments demonstrates this preference-enhancing effect of the delayed
   presentation of favorable information, and it illustrates the underlying
   preference dynamics across decision stages associated with such a delay.
   The findings also indicate that this preference-enhancing effect is
   driven by a combination of two mental mechanisms-a shift in the decision
   weights of attribute dimensions (rendering dimensions on which a delay
   occurs more influential across all alternatives) and an overall
   preference boost for the alternative about which information is delayed.

AB The term "hunger" and terms referring to its physiological correlates,
   notably "salivation," are used to refer to desire for material rewards
   across languages and cultures. Is such usage is " merely metaphorical,"
   or can exposure to material reward cues evoke a salivary response?
   Results of an experiment show that individuals salivate to money when
   induced to experience a low power state but not when induced to
   experience a high power state. A second experiment shows that men
   salivate to sports cars when primed with a mating goal but not in a
   control condition. These findings suggest that salivary secretion is
   stimulated by material rewards in the presence of a highly active goal
   to obtain the rewards and that the motivation to acquire material
   rewards might more closely resemble physiological hunger than previously
   assumed. Implications for material addictions and decision making and
   directions for future research are discussed.

AB When consumers are reminded of money, do they conform, shrug off, or
   react against others' attempts to influence them? Prior research on
   reminders of money suggests that either of the last two outcomes is
   probable. The current research proposed that the self-sufficient
   motivation induced by money reminders causes consumers to perceive
   social influences as threats to their autonomy. We predicted that
   consumers reminded of money would deviate from social influence, an
   effect that would be caused by feeling threatened. Across three
   experiments, money-primed participants behaved opposite to the source of
   influence, displaying reactance stemming from heightened feelings of
   threat. However, this reactance response was eliminated when
   money-primed participants were not personally invested in a decision;
   consequently, they showed indifference in the face of social influence.
   Hence, reminders of money boost the motivation to be autonomous and
   sensitize consumers to potential constraints on their personal
   decision-making freedom.

AB Past research has shown that a physical experience can influence

   of semantic activations underlying such influences, focusing on the
   effects of a ubiquitous physical experience-"carrying weight"-on
   consumers' judgment of importance. Five experiments provide converging
   evidence that semantic activation is the primary underlying process for
   the effect. Specifically, physically carrying a load is neither a
   necessary nor a sufficient condition for processing the concept of
   importance. The effect is fully mediated by semantic activation of
   related weight concepts. Moreover, processing the concept of importance
   does not necessarily influence the physical experience of carrying
   weight. An affective state such as mental stress (psychological load),
   however, does have a reciprocal effect on the physical experience of
   carrying weight, indicating that there might be different pathways
   between weight experience and its metaphorically linked concepts.

AB Consumers often have a variety of products that they may use to help

   consumers' goal attainment. This article investigates (1) how the amount
   of variety (high vs. low) among a set of means affects motivation to
   pursue the associated goal and (2) how this relationship changes over
   the course of goal pursuit as progress is made toward goal attainment.
   Five studies demonstrate that when progress toward goal attainment is
   low, having more variety within a set of means to goal attainment
   increases motivation to pursue the goal. However, when progress toward
   goal attainment is high, having less variety within a set of means to
   goal attainment increases motivation to pursue the goal. These findings

   be motivated to reduce the dissonance and will do so by engaging in
   behaviors that favor the wrongdoer with potentially negative
   consequences for the self. We test our conceptualization across three
   studies. In study 1, we explore the impact of one factor that determines
   whether a white lie falls outside the acceptable range of dishonesty-the
   salience of the norm of honesty. In studies 2 and 3, we examine the role
   of two factors, affect certainty and source certainty, that are
   predicted to moderate the impact of the negative affect on deceiver's
   downstream judgments and behaviors toward the target of the white lie.

   Results from three studies show that lonely consumers prefer
   minority-endorsed products, whereas nonlonely consumers prefer
   majority-endorsed products. However, this pattern occurs only when
   consumers' product preferences are kept private. When product
   preferences are subject to public scrutiny, lonely consumers shift their
   preferences to majority-endorsed products. Results also reveal the
   underlying mechanisms. Minority-endorsed products fit better with the
   feelings of loneliness, and this fit mediates the effect of loneliness
   and endorsement type (i.e., majority vs. minority endorsement) on
   product evaluations in private consumption contexts. Yet, when their
   preferences are subject to public scrutiny, lonely consumers are
   concerned about being negatively evaluated by others, and this concern

   by increasing their understanding of consumption experiences.
   Understanding dampens storytellers' evaluations of and intentions toward

   options. An initial experiment found that consumers view larger-sized
   options within a set as having greater status. Because low-power
   consumers desire status, we manipulated power to test our core
   propositions. Whether induced in the lab or in the field, states of
   powerlessness led individuals to disproportionately choose larger food
   options from an assortment. Furthermore, this preference for
   larger-sized options was enhanced when consumption was public, reversed
   when the size-to-status relationship was negative (i.e., smaller was
   equated with greater status), and mediated by consumers' need for
   status. This research demonstrates that choosing a product on the basis
   of its relative size allows consumers to signal status, illustrates the
   consequences of such a choice for consumers' food consumption, and
   highlights the central role of a product category's size-to-status

AB This article documents a bias in people's causal inferences, showing
   that people nonnormatively consider an event's consequences when
   inferring its causes. Across experiments, participants' inferences about
   event causes were systematically affected by how similar (in both size
   and valence) those causes were to event consequences, even when the
   consequences were objectively uninformative about the causes. For
   example, people inferred that a product failure (computer crash) had a
   large cause (widespread computer virus) if it had a large consequence
   (job loss) but that the identical failure was more likely to have a
   smaller cause (cooling fan malfunction) if the consequence was
   small-even though the consequences gave no new information about what
   caused the crash. This "consequence-cause matching," which can affect
   product attitudes, may arise because people are motivated to see the
   world as predictable and because matching is an accessible schema that
   helps them to fulfill this motivation.

AB In three experiments, nonvolitional self-association is shown to improve
   implicit attitude, self-reported attitude, purchase intention, and
   product choice for both product categories and fictional brands.
   Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that arbitrary categorization of
   self-related content with novel stimuli improved evaluations by creating
   new self-object associations in memory and that the influence of
   self-association is moderated by implicit self-esteem. Experiment 3
   shows that such implicit self-referencing does not require conscious
   self-categorization and occurs even when novel stimuli are simply
   presented in close proximity to self-related content. In this final
   experiment, subjects responded more positively to brands featured in
   banner ads on a personal social networking webpage than when featured on
   an equivalent nonpersonal social networking page. This automatic
   self-association effect was mediated by the degree to which the
   advertising prompted an implicit association between the self and the
   advertised brands.

AB Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for a personally experienced and valued
   past, is a social emotion. It refers to significant others in the
   context of momentous life events and fosters a sense of social
   connectedness. On this basis, the authors hypothesized that (1)
   nostalgia promotes charitable intentions and behavior, and (2) this
   effect is mediated by empathy with the charity's beneficiaries. Five
   studies assessed the effect of nostalgia on empathy, intentions to
   volunteer and donate, as well as tangible charitable behavior. Results
   were consistent with the hypotheses. Study 1 found that nostalgia
   increases charitable intentions. Study 2 showed that this salutary
   effect of nostalgia on charitable intentions is mediated by empathy (but
   not by personal distress). Studies 3 and 4 corroborated these finding
   for different charities and in diverse samples. Finally, study 5
   demonstrated that nostalgia increases tangible charitable behavior. By
   virtue of its capacity to increase empathy, nostalgia facilitates
   prosocial reactions.

   Microsoft's slogan "Where do you want to go today?"). Previous research
   implies that assertive language should reduce consumer compliance. Two
   experiments show that assertiveness is more effective in communications
   involving hedonic products, as well as hedonically advertised
   utilitarian products. This prediction builds on sociolinguistic research
   addressing relationships between mood, communication expectations, and
   compliance to requests. A third experiment reaffirms the role of
   linguistic expectations by showing that an unknown product advertised
   using assertive language is more likely to be perceived as hedonic.

AB When consumers consider a package (multi- item) price, which
   presentation order is more appealing, price first ($29 for 70 items) or
   item quantity first (70 items for $29)? Will this depend on package size
   (larger [70 items] vs. smaller [7 items]) or unit price calculation
   difficulty (higher [$29 for 70 items] vs. lower [$20 for 50 items])?
   Why? Three studies demonstrate how presentation order affects package
   evaluations and choice under different levels of package size and unit
   price calculation difficulty. The first piece of information becomes
   salient and affects evaluations when packages are larger and unit price
   calculations are difficult (i. e., priceitem [item-price] makes price
   [items] salient, negatively [positively] affecting evaluations). These
   effects do not persist with smaller packages or easier unit price
   calculations. Our findings contribute to several literatures (e. g.,
   numerosity, computational difficulty) but primarily to the order effects
   literature and have implications for measurement and practice (e. g.,
   pricing).

AB Consumer research on gifting has primarily focused on the interpersonal
   meanings and behavior patterns associated with dyadic gifts that are
   specifically given from one individual to another and in which the
   central goal is interpersonal relationship maintenance. Yet we find
   another type of gifting when community members in one social position
   give to community members in another position in which the central goal
   is intracommunity, rather than interpersonal, relationship work. This
   ethnographic research details the ritual practices, structural
   components, and meanings associated with intracommunity gifts employing
   the empirical context of the post-Katrina New Orleans' community
   celebration of Mardi Gras. Through this context, we detail how
   intracommunity gifting gives prominence to the logics of the moral
   economy while still drawing from those of the market economy. Beyond
   this context, we use our conclusions about the intersection of the
   market and moral economies to understand contemporary ambivalence to
   corporate sponsorships of local community events.

   answering an intention question on subsequent behavior, this article
   takes on a motivational perspective and proposes that answering an
   intention question automatically activates an intention. The activation
   of this motivational state influences subsequent brand choices due to
   changes in brand accessibilities. Three studies provide support for the
   assumption that responding to an intention question affects brand
   choices through a motivational mechanism, such that (1) answering an
   intention increases the accessibility of motivation-related information
   and decreases the accessibility of motivation-competing information
   which increases the choice for the intentionrelated brand; (2) intention
   completion temporarily reverses the foregoing accessibility patterns,
   instigating a reversal of the brand choices for an immediate, second
   brand choice; and (3) the changes in brand accessibilities and thus the
   behavioral effect persist as the delay between the intention question
   and brand choice occasion increases until intention completion.

AB Although consumers typically expect organizations to profit from
   marketing goods and services, they also believe that certain
   organizations, like those that focus on religion and health, should
   prioritize communal obligations. Indeed, consumers may find it morally
   distressing when communally focused organizations use overtly commercial
   marketing strategies like rebranding or value-based pricing. We
   demonstrate how moral distress and consumer backlash result from such
   taboo tradeoffs and investigate when communal-sharing rhetoric for
   religious and pharmaceutical marketing reduces distress. Communal
   justifications used by communally focused organizations are particularly
   effective when consumers are not closely monitoring the motives of the
   organization or when the product is need-based. However, communal
   justifications become less effective and market-pricing justifications
   become more effective when consumers are attuned to the persuasive
   intentions of the organization. Implications for consumer goals are
   discussed.

AB Quantitative changes may be conveyed to consumers using small units (e.
   g., change in delivery time from 7 to 21 days) or large units (1-3
   weeks). Numerosity research suggests that changes are magnified by small
   (vs. large) units because a change from 7 to 21 (vs. 1-3) seems larger.
   We introduce a reverse effect that we term unitosity: changes are
   magnified by large (vs. small) units because a change of weeks (vs.
   days) seems larger. We show that numerosity reverses to unitosity when
   relative salience shifts from numbers to units (study 1). Then, arguing
   that numbers (units) represent a low-level (high-level) construal of
   quantities, we show this reversal when mind-set shifts from concrete to
   abstract (studies 2-4). These results emerge for several
   quantities-height of buildings, time of maturity of financial
   instruments, weight of nutrients, and length of tables-and have
   significant implications for theory and practice.

AB This research examines the effect of experiencing messiness, induced by
   a messy environment or by priming the concept of messiness, on
   consumers. We propose that messiness is an aversive state and that
   consumers are motivated to attenuate this state by seeking simplicity in
   their cognitions, preferences, and choices. Six experiments support our
   theorizing. Experiments 1A-1C (conducted in the laboratory) and
   experiment 2 (conducted in the field) demonstrate that when messiness is
   salient, consumers form simpler product categorizations, are willing to
   pay more for a T-shirt with a simple picture, and seek less variety in
   their choices. Experiment 3 brings additional evidence for the
   underlying role of the need for simplicity by showing that when the need
   for simplicity is satiated, the effects of messiness disappear. A final
   experiment shows a boundary condition of the messiness effect: political
   conservatives are more susceptible to messiness primes compared to
   liberals.

AB The same quantity can be expressed at different levels of granularity,
   for example, "1 year," "12 months," or "365 days." Consumers attend to
   the granularity chosen by a communicator and draw pragmatic inferences
   that influence judgment and choice. They consider estimates expressed in
   finer granularity more precise and have more confidence in their
   accuracy (studies 1-4). This effect is eliminated when consumers doubt
   that the communicator complies with Gricean norms of cooperative
   conversational conduct (studies 2-3). Based on their pragmatic
   inferences, consumers perceive products as more likely to deliver on
   their promises when the promise is described in fine-grained rather than
   coarse terms and choose accordingly (study 4). These findings highlight
   the role of pragmatic inferences in consumer judgment and have important
   implications for the design of marketing communications.

   trigger people's goals for a successful social interaction, resulting in
   behavior that is assimilative or contrastive to the brand's image. Three
   studies show that consumers are more likely to assimilate behavior
   associated with anthropomorphized partner brands that they like,
   consistent with the goal of drawing in the liked coproducer, and servant
   brands that they dislike, consistent with the goal of pushing the
   disliked would-be helper away by signaling self-sufficiency. Results
   also show a contrastive behavior when primed with disliked partner
   brands and liked servant brands. These effects are observed in contexts
   unrelated to the brand prime. For example, priming Kellogg's, a liked
   partner brand associated with healthfulness, led to greater willingness
   to take the stairs than the elevator in a purportedly unrelated study.
   No effects were observed of priming brands that were not

AB Consumers want to be happy, and marketers are increasingly trying to
   appeal to consumers' pursuit of happiness. However, the results of six
   studies reveal that what happiness means varies, and consumers' choices
   reflect those differences. In some cases, happiness is defined as
   feeling excited, and in other cases, happiness is defined as feeling
   calm. The type of happiness pursued is determined by one's temporal
   focus, such that individuals tend to choose more exciting options when
   focused on the future, and more calming options when focused on the
   present moment. These results suggest that the definition of happiness,
   and consumers' resulting choices, are dynamic and malleable.

AB Despite the challenged contention that consumers serve more onto larger
   dinnerware, it remains unclear what would cause this and who might be
   most at risk. The results of five studies suggest that the neglected
   Delboeuf illusion may explain how the size of dinnerware creates two
   opposing biases that lead people to overserve on larger plates and bowls
   and underserve on smaller ones. A countercyclical sinus-shaped
   relationship is shown to exist between these serving biases and the
   relative gap between the edge of the food and the edge of the
   dinnerware. Although these serving biases are difficult to eliminate
   with attention and education, changing the color of one's dinnerware or
   tablecloth may help attenuate them. By showing that the Delboeuf
   illusion offers a mechanistic explanation for how dinnerware size can
   bias serving and intake, we open new theoretical opportunities for
   linking illusions to eating behavior and suggest how simple changes in
   design can improve consumer welfare.

AB In this study, we attempt to understand how household budget allocations
   across various expenditure categories change when the economy is in
   recession or expansion. The common assumption is that a household's
   tastes would not change as a function of economic conditions and
   therefore any adjustments in expenditure patterns during economic
   contractions/expansions would simply be due to changes in the
   consumption budget. Standard economic models translate these budgetary
   effects into lateral movements along a set of fixed Engel curves, which
   relate category expenditure shares to total expenditures. We propose and
   test a conceptual framework based on the notion of relative consumption,
   which prescribes that, for any given total consumption budget,
   expenditure shares for positional goods/services will decrease during a
   recession, while shares for nonpositional goods/services will increase
   (i.e., shifting the entire Engel curve upward or downward, depending on
   the nature of the expenditure category and the economic conditions).

AB Are romance movies more desirable when people are cold? Building on
   research on (bodily) feeling-as-information and embodied cognition, we
   hypothesize that physical coldness activates a need for psychological
   warmth, which in turn leads to an increased liking for romance movies.
   Four laboratory experiments and an analysis of online movie rental data
   provide support for our hypothesis. Specifically, studies 1A and 1B show
   that physical coldness increases the liking of and willingness to pay
   for romance movies. Study 2 shows that the effect of physical coldness
   on liking of romance movies only occurs for people who associate romance
   movies with psychological warmth. Study 3 shows that people correct for
   the influence of physical coldness on their liking of romance movies
   when physical coldness is made salient. In study 4, using data on online
   movie rentals and historical temperature, we found a negative
   relationship between weather temperature and preference for romance
   movies.

   were conducted to test several related hypotheses. Psychological
   distance was altered by activating a construal mind-set and by varying
   bodily distance from a given task. Activating an abstract mind-set
   reduced the feeling of difficulty. A direct manipulation of distance
   from the task produced the same effect: participants found the task to
   be less difficult when they distanced themselves from the task by
   leaning back in their seats. The experiments not only identify
   psychological distance as a hitherto unexplored but ubiquitous
   determinant of task difficulty but also identify bodily distance as an

AB Volitional reconsumption refers to experiences that consumers actively
   and consciously seek to experience again. Phenomenological interviews
   centered on the rereading of books, the rewatching of movies, and the
   revisiting of geographic places reveal the temporal and focal dimensions
   of hedonic volitional reconsumption phenomenon and five dominant
   categories therein. Consumers navigate within and between reconsumption
   experiences in a hyperresponsive and experientially controlled manner.
   The dynamics in time and focus fueled by the reconsumed object allow
   emotional efficiency, as consumers optimize the search for and
   attainment of the emotional outcomes sought in volitional reconsumption,
   and facilitate existential understanding, as the linkages across past,
   present, and future experiences enable an active synthesis of time and
   promote self-reflexivity. Consumers gain richer and deeper insights into
   the reconsumption object itself but also an enhanced awareness of their
   own growth in understanding and appreciation through the lens of the
   reconsumption object.

AB People often get unnecessarily mired in trivial decisions. Four studies
   support a metacognitive account for this painful phenomenon. Our central
   premise is that people use subjective experiences of difficulty while
   making a decision as a cue to how much further time and effort to spend.
   People generally associate important decisions with difficulty.
   Consequently, if a decision feels unexpectedly difficult, due to even
   incidental reasons, people may draw the reverse inference that it is
   also important and consequently increase the amount of time and effort
   they expend. Ironically, this process is particularly likely for
   decisions that initially seemed unimportant because people expect them
   to be easier (whereas important decisions are expected to be difficult
   to begin with). Our studies demonstrate that unexpected difficulty not
   only causes people to get caught up in unimportant decisions but also to
   voluntarily seek more options, which can increase decision difficulty
   even further.

AB Marketers often extend product lines by offering limited-capability
   models that are created by removing or degrading features in existing
   models. This production method, called versioning, has been lauded
   because of its ability to increase both consumer and firm welfare.
   According to rational utility models, consumers weigh benefits relative
   to their costs in evaluating a product. So the production method should
   not be relevant. Anecdotal evidence suggests otherwise. Six studies show
   how the production method of versioning may be perceived as unfair and
   unethical and lead to decreased purchase intentions for the brand.
   Building on prior work in fairness, the studies show that this effect is
   driven by violations of norms and the perceived similarity between the
   inferior, degraded version of a product and the full-featured model
   offered by the brand.

   subtraction effect to the categorical nature of consumers' processing of

AB Just as good looks bestow an unconscious "beauty premium" on people,
   high aesthetics bestows an unrecognized benefit on consumer goods.
   Specifically, choosing a product with good design affirms the consumer's
   sense of self. Choice of a highly aesthetic product was compared with
   choice of products superior on other attributes including function,
   brand, and hedonics to show that only aesthetics influences a consumer's
   personal values. In study 1 a prior self-affirming task leads to a
   decrease in choice share of a highly aesthetic option. Studies 2 and 3
   mimic prior research on self-affirmation with, however, choice of a
   highly aesthetic product replacing a traditional self-affirmation
   manipulation. Choosing a product with good design resulted in increased
   openness to counter-attitudinal arguments and reduced propensity to
   escalate commitment toward a failing course of action. There are
   numerous implications of this form of self-affirmation, from public
   policy to retail therapy.

AB This analysis introduces the Presenter's Paradox. Robust findings in
   impression formation demonstrate that perceivers' judgments show a
   weighted averaging pattern, which results in less favorable evaluations
   when mildly favorable information is added to highly favorable
   information. Across seven studies, we show that presenters do not
   anticipate this averaging pattern on the part of evaluators and instead
   design presentations that include all of the favorable information
   available. This additive strategy ("more is better") hurts presenters in
   their perceivers' eyes because mildly favorable information dilutes the
   impact of highly favorable information. For example, presenters choose
   to spend more money to make a product bundle look more costly, even
   though doing so actually cheapened its value from the evaluators'
   perspective (study 1). Additional studies demonstrate the robustness of
   the effect, investigate the psychological processes underlying it, and
   examine its implications for a variety of marketing contexts.

AB This article examines a small-area hypothesis: individuals striving
   toward a goal end state exhibit greater motivation when their attention
   is directed to whichever is smaller in size-their accumulated or
   remaining progress. The result is that, at the beginning of goal
   pursuit, directing attention to accumulated progress increases goal
   adherence relative to directing attention to remaining progress (e. g.,
   20% completed is more impactful than 80% remaining). However, with
   closeness to the goal, directing attention to accumulated progress
   lessens goal adherence relative to directing attention to remaining
   progress (e. g., 20% remaining is more impactful than 80% completed;
   studies 1-2). The focus on small areas increases motivation by creating
   an illusion of fast progress (study 3). Therefore, when individuals wish
   to prolong goal pursuit and avoid reaching the goal's end state, they
   slow down goal adherence when their attention is directed to small areas
   (study 4).

AB This study investigates consumers' relationship to possessions in the
   condition of contemporary global nomadism. Prior research argues that
   consumers form enduring and strong attachments to possessions because of
   their centrality to identity projects. This role is heightened in life
   transitions including cross-border movements as possessions anchor
   consumer's identities either to their homeland or to the host country.
   This study reexamines this claim via in-depth interviews with elite
   global nomads, deterritorialized consumers who engage in serial
   relocation and frequent short-term international mobility. An
   alternative relationship to possessions characterized by detachment and
   flexibility emerges, which is termed "liquid." Three characteristics of
   a liquid relationship to possessions are identified: temporary
   situational value, use-value, and immateriality. The study outlines a
   logic of nomadic consumption, that of instrumentality, where possessions
   and practices are strategic resources in managing mobility. A liquid
   perspective on possessions expands current understandings of
   materiality, acculturation, and globalization.

   similarly assess their financial wellbeing, and when these evaluations
   highlight a deficit in their financial position, they pursue strategies
   that mitigate the associated sense of financial deprivation.
   Specifically, consumers counteract the relative deficit in their
   financial resources by acquiring goods that are consequently unavailable
   to other consumers in their environment. The results from five studies
   suggest that the inferiority and unpleasant affect associated with
   financial deprivation motivates consumers to attend to, choose, and
   consume scarce goods rather than comparable abundant goods. These
   effects diminish when scarce goods are limited because other people have
   already obtained them and when consumers attribute their unpleasant

AB How do consumers reconcile conflicting motives for social group

   group on one dimension (by conforming on identity-signaling attributes

   (distinguishing themselves on uniqueness attributes such as color).
   Desires to communicate social identity lead consumers to conform on
   choice dimensions that are strongly associated with their group,
   particularly in identity-relevant consumer categories such as clothing.
   Higher needs for uniqueness lead consumers to differentiate within
   groups by choosing less popular options among those that are associated

   insight into how multiple identity motives jointly influence consumer

AB Implementation intentions are specific plans regarding how, when, and

   for a single goal has been shown to facilitate goal achievement, but do
   such intentions benefit multiple goals? If so, people should form
   implementation intentions for all their goals, from eating healthily to
   tidying up. An investigation into this question suggests that the
   benefits of implemental planning for attaining a single goal do not
   typically extend to multiple goals. Instead, implemental planning draws
   attention to the difficulty of executing multiple goals, which
   undermines commitment to those goals relative to other desirable
   activities and thereby undermines goal success. Framing the execution of
   multiple goals as a manageable endeavor, however, reduces the perceived
   difficulty of multiple goal pursuit and helps consumers accomplish the
   various tasks they planned for. This research contributes to literature
   on goal management, goal specificity, the intention-behavior link, and

   only among individuals who possess sufficient background knowledge about

   studies demonstrate that because lying interferes with the ability to
   use diagnostic cues to update outcome expectations, liars are less

AB This article examines how consumers' preferences are affected by the
   interplay between their level of arousal and the valence of their
   current affective state. Building on prior research examining the
   regulation of mood valence, the authors propose that consumers are also
   motivated to manage their level of arousal. It is predicted that this
   motivation systematically affects consumers' product preferences such
   that consumers in a pleasant mood will tend to choose products that are
   congruent with their current level of arousal, while those in an
   unpleasant mood will tend to choose products that are incongruent with
   their current level of arousal. The results of three consequential
   choice studies-that use scent and music to vary consumers' moods-provide
   strong support for the hypotheses. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the theoretical implications of the results.

AB Consumers frequently engage in sequential decisions. This article
   explores whether the order of these decisions can influence the manner
   in which consumers search through the possible choice options. Results
   from five studies suggest that ordering decisions by increasing (vs.
   decreasing) choice-set size leads to greater search depth (measured by
   both sampling count and decision time). Initial, smaller choice sets in
   increasing sequences appear to initiate a maximizing mind-set, which
   then persists even as participants encounter later, larger choice sets.
   These participants report a greater desire to maximize and are less
   satisfied with their decisions, consistent with research on chronic
   maximizers. In addition, they continue to exhibit maximizing behavior in
   subsequent, unrelated tasks, supporting a mind-set account of the
   differences in search. In sum, decision makers are proposed to be
   "sticky adapters": initial decision strategies seem to constrain the
   extent to which they adapt to new contexts.

AB In a process the authors term just world coping, some consumers use
   positive beliefs concerning the general benevolence of the world as a
   resource to cope with marketplace threat. This belief buffers or even,
   ironically, enhances trust judgments in the face of threat. Three
   experiments and one replication show that, whereas consumers who do not
   hold this belief respond to decision-generated threat with distrust,
   trust is significantly higher for those who believe in a just world
   (optimistic trust effect). Process evidence shows such coping is
   automatically activated in response to threat but can be corrected for
   more normative considerations when an obvious ulterior motive is
   present. Finally, evidence this coping serves an ego-protective function
   is provided by manipulating whether consumers are directly threatened.
   Overall, findings are consistent with the view that belief in a just
   world operates as a positive illusion that allows consumers to cope with
   decision threat.

AB Can subtle wording changes in marketing communications, such as saying
   "you and [the brand]" as opposed to " we," affect people's evaluations
   of real-world brands? Despite their importance in interpersonal
   communication, the effects of such variations in relationship-implying
   language on consumers' perceptions of brands have received little
   research attention. Four experiments demonstrate that closeness-implying
   pronouns (e.g., saying "we" rather than " you and the brand") can have
   either positive or negative effects on consumers' attitudes toward
   real-world brands with which they have real working relationships. The
   experiments show that these effects depend on whether the closeness
   implied by the pronoun is consistent with people's expected interactions
   with the brand. These effects are moderated by people's affiliation with
   the brand (i.e., customers vs. noncustomers), brand type, and the extent
   of cognitive elaboration and are mediated by perceived brand
   trustworthiness. The theoretical and practical implications of these
   findings are discussed.

AB Religion and ideology are prominent forces shaping consumption. While
   consumer researchers have studied both topics considerably, examinations
   of religious ideology remain scant. Notably lacking is research on how
   religion, myths, and ideology intertwine in the marketplace, informing
   attitudes toward brands. This ethnography investigates how the religious
   ideology of Islamism informs brand meanings among low-income Turkish
   consumers and identifies three discourses that construct global brands
   as infidels. Informants use the infidel parable to characterize market
   societies as devoid of social equality, morality, and justice. Their
   critique culminates in a consumer jihad against global brands. Through
   the consumer jihad, informants accommodate and protest the social crises
   posed by modernity and globalization as they seek to recreate the Golden
   Age of Islam. Exploring the relationships among economic means, cultural
   capital, and religious ideology helps this study bridge related domains
   of research on religiosity, ideology, and brand meanings that are often
   investigated separately.

   Investigation of the attention process revealed an initial central
   fixation bias, a tendency to look first at the central option, and a
   central gaze cascade effect, progressively increasing attention focused
   on the central option right prior to decision. Only the central gaze
   cascade effect was related to choice. An offline study with tangible
   products demonstrated that the centrally located item within a product
   category is chosen more often, even when it is not placed in the center

AB Access-based consumption, defined as transactions that can be market
   mediated but where no transfer of ownership takes place, is becoming
   increasingly popular, yet it is not well theorized. This study examines
   the nature of access as it contrasts to ownership and sharing,
   specifically the consumer-object, consumer-consumer, and
   consumer-marketer relationships. Six dimensions are identified to
   distinguish among the range of access-based consumptionscapes:
   temporality, anonymity, market mediation, consumer involvement, the type
   of accessed object, and political consumerism. Access-based consumption
   is examined in the context of car sharing via an interpretive study of
   Zipcar consumers. Four outcomes of these dimensions in the context of
   car sharing are identified: lack of identification, varying significance
   of use and sign value, negative reciprocity resulting in a big-brother
   model of governance, and a deterrence of brand community. The
   implications of our findings for understanding the nature of exchange,
   consumption, and brand community are discussed.

AB Previous research suggests making plans is generally beneficial for

   of five experiments reveal that planning does not always benefit
   everyone. Although planning tends to aid subsequent self-control for
   those who are in good standing with respect to their long-term goal,
   those who perceive themselves to be in poor goal standing are found to
   exert less self-control after planning than in the absence of planning.
   This occurs because considering a concrete plan for goal implementation
   creates emotional distress for those in poor goal standing, thereby
   undermining their motivation for self-regulation. Findings of the fifth
   study suggest that engaging positive self-related thoughts in the
   relevant domain after planning can prevent any negative consequences of
   planning on subsequent behavior.

AB The current research examines the conditions under which consumers
   demonstrate associative versus dissociative responses to identity-linked
   products as a consequence of a social identity threat. Across four
   studies, the authors test the notion that reactions to social identity
   threat may be moderated by self-construal by examining subcultural
   differences in ethnic background, priming self-construal, and
   investigating cross-national differences in cultural background. Those
   with more independent self-construals tend to avoid identity-linked
   products when that identity is threatened versus not threatened. Those
   with more interdependent self-construals, in contrast, demonstrate more
   positive preferences for identity-linked products when that aspect of
   social identity is threatened. These effects arise because, while
   independents are motivated to restore positive self-worth when a social
   identity is threatened, interdependents access a repertoire of social
   identities to fulfill belongingness needs when threatened.

AB Consumers prefer larger assortments, despite the negative consequences
   associated with choosing from these sets. This article examines the role
   of psychological distance (temporal and geographical) in consumers'
   assortment size decisions and rectifies contradicting hypotheses
   produced by construal level theory. Six studies demonstrate that while
   consumers prefer larger assortments when the choice takes place in the
   here and now, they are more likely to prefer small assortments when
   choices pertain to distant locations and times. This decrease in
   preference for large assortments is due to psychological distance
   increasing the similarity of the options in a category, making them
   appear more substitutable. This effect of psychological distance
   reverses when consumers consider desirability/feasibility trade-off
   information inherent in the assortment size decision. These findings
   point to important outcomes of psychological distance, resolving
   opposing predictions of construal level theory, and identify boundary
   conditions for the well-established notion that consumers are attracted
   to large assortments.

AB Neuroscientific research suggests that the brain has evolved specific

   has considered the consequences of how facial imagery is automatically
   processed. We explore automatic perceptions of familiarity by using
   morphing software to digitally combine unfamiliar faces with those of
   Tiger Woods and George Bush. Despite a complete lack of conscious
   recognition, trustworthiness ratings of the composite faces are clearly
   influenced by the celebrities in question. This appears to be due to
   implicit recognition being sufficient for individuals to automatically
   access their own summary valence judgments of either Woods or Bush.
   Alternative explanations based on a perceptual-fluency account, or
   implicit recognition sufficient to perceive specific trait ratings, are
   ruled out. These findings suggest that the marketing practice of
   digitally manipulating the attractiveness of facial imagery risks

AB Purchases fall along a continuum from ordinary (common or frequent) to

   (e.g., electronics, celebrations) being the most exceptional. Across
   seven studies, we show that, while people are fairly adept at budgeting
   and predicting how much they will spend on ordinary items, they both
   underestimate their spending on exceptional purchases overall and
   overspend on each individual purchase. Based on the principles of mental
   accounting and choice bracketing, we show that this discrepancy arises
   in part because consumers categorize exceptional expenses too narrowly,
   construing each as a unique occurrence and consequently overspending
   across a series of discretely exceptional expenses. We conclude by
   proposing an intervention that diminishes this tendency by helping
   consumers consider their spending on exceptional items as part of a
   larger set of purchases.

AB Although subjective judgment of future time plays an important role in a

   such judgments and their implications. Based on a time as distance

   this article demonstrates that spatial distance influences judgment of
   future time. Participants who consider a longer spatial distance judge
   the same future time to be longer than those considering a shorter
   distance. Intertemporal preferences, for which judgment of future delays
   is a critical factor, also shift with consideration of spatial distance:
   participants who consider a longer spatial distance also reveal a

AB Taste has been conceptualized as a boundary-making mechanism, yet there
   is limited theory on how it enters into daily practice. In this article,
   the authors develop a practice-based framework of taste through
   qualitative and quantitative analysis of a popular home design blog,
   interviews with blog participants, and participant observation. First, a
   taste regime is defined as a discursively constructed normative system
   that orchestrates practice in an aesthetically oriented culture of
   consumption. Taste regimes are perpetuated by marketplace institutions
   such as magazines, websites, and transmedia brands. Second, the authors
   show how a taste regime regulates practice through continuous
   engagement. By integrating three dispersed practices-problematization,
   ritualization, and instrumentalization-a taste regime shapes preferences
   for objects, the doings performed with objects, and what meanings are
   associated with objects. This study demonstrates how aesthetics is
   linked to practical knowledge and becomes materialized through everyday
   consumption.

AB The authors investigate the effect of red backgrounds on
   willingness-to-pay in auctions and negotiations. Data from eBay auctions
   and the lab show that a red (vs. blue) background elicits higher bid
   jumps. By contrast, red (vs. blue) backgrounds decrease price offers in
   negotiations. An investigation of the underlying process reveals that
   red color induces aggression through arousal. In addition, the selling
   mechanism-auction or negotiation-alters the effect of color by focusing
   individuals on primarily competing against other bidders (in auctions)
   or against the seller (in negotiations). Specifically, aggression is
   higher with red (vs. blue or gray) color and, therefore, increases bid
   jumps in auctions but decreases offers in negotiations.

AB Donations to large numbers of victims are typically muted relative to
   donations to a single identified victim. This article shows that people
   can donate more to large numbers of victims if these victims are
   perceived as entitative-comprising a single, coherent unit. For example,
   donations to help children in need are higher when the children comprise
   a family than when they have no explicit group membership. The same
   effect is observed on donations for endangered animals that are depicted
   as moving in unison. Perceived entitativity results in more extreme
   judgments of victims. Victims with positive traits are therefore viewed
   more favorably when entitative, triggering greater feelings of concern
   and higher donations. Entitativity has the opposite effect for victims
   sharing negative traits.

AB Although heterogeneity in consumption communities is pervasive, there is
   little understanding of its impact on communities. This study shows how
   heterogeneous communities operate and interact with the marketplace.
   Specifically, the authors draw on actor-network theory, conceptualizing
   community as a network of heterogeneous actors (i.e., individuals,
   institutions, and resources), and examine the interplay of these actors
   in a mainstream activity-based consumption community-the distance
   running community. Findings, derived from a multimethod investigation,
   show that communities can preserve continuity even when heterogeneity
   operates as a destabilizing force. Continuity preserves when community
   members depend on each other for social and economic resources: a
   dependency that promotes the use of frame alignment practices. These
   practices enable the community to (re) stabilize, reproduce, and reform
   over time. The authors also highlight the overlapping roles of consumers
   and producers and develop a dimensional characterization of communities
   that helps bridge prior research on brand communities, consumption
   subcultures, and consumer tribes.

AB Prior consumer research theorizes nature as an ideal stage for romantic
   consumption experiences by framing nature as external to culture. The
   same studies, however, problematize this framing by highlighting the
   consumer-cultural resources through which nature is harnessed and
   interpreted. Through an ethnography of surfing culture, this article
   theorizes consumers' experiences of nature as emerging from assemblages
   of heterogeneous resources. A theory of assemblage shows that material
   geographies are vital to the reproduction of romantic discourses.
   Assemblages of nature are characterized by fragility and contestation,
   however, due to service structures, technological resources, and social
   tensions that betray the ideal of external nature. Consumers overcome
   these contradictions through purifying practices. Purifying practices
   preserve romantic beliefs that nature is external to culture by masking
   or purging problematic elements of assemblages. The negative
   environmental effects of these practices are discussed and compared with
   sustainable purifying practices that redress the damaging impact of
   consuming nature.

   commitment, self-signaling, and the principle of consistency, a large,
   intensive field experiment (N = 2,416) examined the effect of hotel
   guests' commitment to practice environmentally friendly behavior during
   their stay. Notably, commitment was symbolic-guests were unaware of the
   experiment and of the fact that their behavior would be monitored, which
   allowed them to exist in anonymity and behave as they wish. When guests
   made a brief but specific commitment at check-in, and received a lapel
   pin to symbolize their commitment, they were over 25% more likely to
   hang at least one towel for reuse, and this increased the total number
   of towels hung by over 40%. This research highlights how a small,
   carefully planned intervention can have a significant impact on
   behavior. Theoretical and practical implications for motivating desired
   behavior are discussed.

AB Self-control is typically viewed as a battle between willpower and
   desire. The authors focus on the desire side of the equation and extol
   the positive effect of faster satiation that makes unhealthy behaviors
   less tempting. They demonstrate that consumers higher in trait
   self-control demonstrate such "healthy" satiation as they satiate faster
   on unhealthy foods than on healthy foods. In contrast, those with lower
   self-control fail to consistently show this differential pattern in
   their satiation rates. This difference for high self-control people can
   result from faster satiation for unhealthy foods, slower satiation for
   healthy foods, or both in combination. Moderating and mediating evidence
   establish that changes in attention to the amount consumed helped
   account for these effects on the rate of satiation. The resulting
   differences in satiation influence the ultimate intake of unhealthy
   foods, underscoring the importance of the contribution made by
   differential satiation rates to overconsumption and obesity.

AB How do consumers manage goal conflicts before making a choice? This
   question was studied by examining emerging preferences in choices
   involving two products that were means to conflicting goals. These
   preference patterns revealed that an initially active goal, which had
   been set aside to reconcile a goal conflict, exerted greater than
   expected influence on the remainder of the choice process. This
   influence was manifest in a tendency for consumers to revert to the
   product aligned with the initially active goal upon seeing information
   that objectively favored neither product. The prevalence of the
   reversion (i.e., flip-flop) preference pattern suggests that activation
   of a set-aside goal escalates when it is set aside, much as if its
   pursuit had been impeded by an external force. In addition to revealing
   goal reversion in a variety of choice contexts, the studies in this
   article also find that goal reversion is moderated by goal conflict.

AB This research examines how consumers use base rate (e.g., disease
   prevalence in a population) and case information (e.g., an individual's
   disease symptoms) to estimate health risks. Drawing on construal level
   theory, we propose that consumers' reliance on base rate (case
   information) will be enhanced (weakened) by psychological distance. A
   corollary of this premise is that self-positivity (i.e., underestimating
   self-risk vs. other-risk) is likely when the disease base rate is high
   but the case information suggests low risk. In contrast, self-negativity
   (i.e., overestimating self-risk vs. other-risk) is likely when the
   disease base rate is low, but case information implies high risk. Six
   experiments provide convergent support for this thesis, using different
   operationalizations of construal level, base rate, and case risk across
   multiple health domains. Our findings inform the extant literature on
   health-risk perception and also provide theoretical implications for
   research on social comparisons, as well as that on the use of base rate
   versus case information.

AB A large literature demonstrates that people process information more
   carefully in states of low compared to high confidence. This article
   presents an alternative hypothesis that either high or low confidence
   can increase or decrease information processing on the basis of how
   information is construed. Five experiments demonstrate two sets of
   findings supporting this alternative formulation. First, low confidence
   leads people to focus on concrete construals, whereas high confidence
   leads people to focus on abstract construals. Second, people in a state
   of low confidence view messages framed in a concrete manner as more
   relevant and thus engage in greater processing of messages framed
   concretely; in contrast, people in a state of high confidence view
   messages framed in an abstract manner as more relevant and thus engage
   in greater processing of messages framed abstractly. These results
   enrich the literature by providing a fundamental shift in understanding
   how psychological confidence influences information processing.

AB The price people are willing to pay for a good is often less than the

   called the endowment effect. Loss aversion has typically accounted for
   the endowment effect, but an alternative explanation suggests that
   ownership creates an association between the item and the self, and this
   possession-self link increases the value of the good. To test the
   ownership account, this research examines three moderators that theory
   suggests should affect the possession-self link and consequently the
   endowment effect: self-threat, identity associations of a good, and
   gender. After a social self-threat, the endowment effect is strengthened
   for in-group goods among both men and women but is eliminated for
   out-group goods among men (but not women). These results are consistent
   with a possession-self link explanation and therefore suggest that
   ownership offers a better explanation for the endowment effect.

   In contrast, consumers are more motivated and willing to pay for means

   foes derive less understanding from detailed than coarse explanations
   and downgrade products that are explained in detail. Consumers' attitude
   toward explanation is predicted by their tendency to deliberate, as
   measured by the cognitive reflection test. Cognitive reflection also
   predicts susceptibility to the illusion of explanatory depth, the
   unjustified belief that one understands how things work. When
   explanation foes attempt to explain, it exposes the illusion, which
   leads to a decrease in willingness to pay. In contrast, explanation

AB The idea of money reminds consumers of personal strength and resources.
   Such cues have been found to increase the level of mental construal.
   Consequently, it was hypothesized and found in five experiments that
   reminders of money trigger abstract (vs. concrete) mental construals.
   Participants were primed with money or money-unrelated concepts. Money
   primes caused a preference for abstract over concrete action
   identifications (experiment 1), instigated the formation of broader
   categories (experiment 2), and facilitated the identification of global
   (vs. local) aspects of visual patterns (experiment 3). This effect
   extended to consumer judgments: money primes caused a focus on central
   (vs. peripheral) aspects of products (experiment 4) and increased the
   influence of quality of parent brands in evaluations of brand
   extensions. Priming with a little money (experiment 3) or expenditures
   (experiment 5) did not trigger abstract construals, indicating that the
   association between money and resources drives the effect.

AB What reasoning processes do consumers use to support public figures who
   act immorally? Existing research emphasizes moral rationalization,
   whereby people reconstrue improper behavior in order to maintain support
   for a transgressor. In contrast, the current research proposes that
   people also engage in moral decoupling, a previously unstudied moral
   reasoning process by which judgments of performance are separated from
   judgments of morality. By separating these judgments, moral decoupling
   allows consumers to support a transgressor's performance while
   simultaneously condemning his or her transgressions. Five laboratory
   studies demonstrate that moral decoupling exists and is psychologically
   distinct from moral rationalization. Moreover, because moral decoupling
   does not involve condoning immoral behavior, it is easier to justify
   than moral rationalization. Finally, a field study suggests that in
   discussions involving public figures' transgressions, moral decoupling
   may be more predictive of consumer support (and opposition) than moral
   rationalization.

AB Consumers often make inferences to fill in gaps in knowledge when they
   do not have complete information regarding products. Eight experiments
   show that consumers often have contradictory naive theories about the
   implications of common market phenomena and that they draw different
   conclusions as a function of which naive theory is primed, even when
   available information is held constant. Results indicate that
   conflicting naive theories about pricing, sales promotion, product
   popularity versus scarcity, and technical language drive product
   evaluation. Consumers who have expertise in a given product category are
   less susceptible to the priming of a naive theory. This research
   contributes to more precise understanding of how consumers will respond
   to different levels of key marketing variables and how marketing tactics
   can backfire.

AB As competition for consumer attention continues to increase, marketers
   must depend in part on effects from advertising exposure that result
   from less deliberate processing. One such effect is processing fluency.
   Building on the change detection literature, this research brings a
   dynamic perspective to fluency research. Three experiments demonstrate
   that brand logos and product depictions capture greater fluency when
   they change location in an advertisement from one exposure to the ad to
   the next. As a consequence, logo preference and brand choice are
   enhanced. Evidence shows that spontaneous detection of the location
   change instigates this process and that change detection is incidental
   in nature; participants in all three experiments were unable to
   accurately report which brand logos or product depictions changed
   location across ad exposures. These findings suggest that subtle changes
   to ad design across repeated exposures can facilitate variables of
   import to marketers, even when processing is minimal.

AB The effect of inequity on satisfaction-people who are underbenefited are
   less satisfied than those who are overbenefited-is robust across many
   domains. However, various factors may moderate this effect, and a key
   perspective centers on value sensitivity. The present research
   demonstrates that countability (how easily a product or service can be
   counted using simple whole numbers) feeds into value sensitivity and
   thus moderates the impact of inequity on satisfaction. Across nine
   experiments, we show that when rewards are less easily counted, the
   effect of inequity on satisfaction is diminished. Further, this effect
   is rooted to a mechanism in which less countable rewards shift cognitive
   focus from value comparison to consumption experience. This research
   contributes to literature on value sensitivity, comparative thinking,
   numerical information processing, fairness, and happiness.

AB A fundamental assumption of choice models is that products are valued
   for the benefits they provide. The only non-benefit-based source of
   preference is the processing fluency (e. g., ease of perceiving,
   encoding, comprehending, or retrieving information) that results from
   prior exposure to the product. This research documents an additional
   source of non-benefit-based "preference formation." Repeatedly
   allocating attention to a product (selective attention) and away from
   other products (inattention) subsequently influences choices between
   these products and competing products. Five experiments show that prior
   selective attention (inattention) to a product increases the likelihood
   the product will be selected (rejected) in a subsequent choice.
   Demonstrating that prior acts of attention can influence subsequent
   choices has implications for any visually complex environment in which
   marketers communicate about a brand (e. g., banner advertising,
   packaging). The results also speak to how stimulus-based choices can
   have enduring consequences.

AB Previous research on attribute framing has shown that people often infer
   higher quantity from larger numbers, usually with the assumption that
   the units used to specify this information elicit the same meanings.
   Drawing on literature on categorization and numerical cognition, the
   authors challenge this assumption and show that consumers often have
   preset units for attribute levels that strike an optimal balance between
   a preference for small numbers and the need for accuracy (study 1a). As
   such, these default units appear commonly (study 1b). Specifying
   positive attributes in default units renders products' evaluation more
   favorable, even if such specification lowers the nominal value of the
   attributes (studies 2-4). This effect disappears if participants
   attribute metacognitive feelings generated by default units to an
   irrelevant source (study 3). Study 5 shows that a default unit effect is
   more likely in single evaluation mode, but a numerosity effect may
   reemerge in joint evaluations.

AB A series of laboratory and field experiments reveals a detrimental
   effect of presenting options sequentially (one at a time) versus
   simultaneously (all at once) on choosers' satisfaction with and
   commitment to their chosen option. This is because choosers presented
   with their options simultaneously tend to remain focused on the current
   set of options, comparing them among each other; whereas choosers
   presented with their options sequentially tend to imagine a better
   option, hoping it will become available. This feeling of hope undermines
   how choosers subsequently experience their selected option, resulting in
   lower satisfaction and commitment levels. Sequential choosers
   consequently exhibit lower outcome satisfaction regardless of which
   option they choose, whether sequentially passed-up options remain
   available, and whether they have equivalent option information to
   simultaneous choosers. Thus, enjoying the most satisfaction from one's
   choice might require being willing to give up the eternal quest for the

AB Despite evidence that currency denomination can influence spending,
   researchers have yet to examine whether the physical appearance of money
   can do the same. This is important because smaller denomination bills
   tend to suffer greater wear than larger denomination bills. Using real
   money in the context of real purchases, this article demonstrates that
   the physical appearance of money can override the influence of
   denomination. The reason being, people want to rid themselves of worn
   bills because they are disgusted by the contamination from others,
   whereas people put a premium on crisp currency because they take pride
   in owning bills that can be spent around others. This suggests that the
   physical appearance of money matters more than traditionally thought,
   and like most things in life, it too is inextricably linked to the
   social context. The results suggest that money may be less fungible than
   people think.

AB The current research examines how the price of a medication influences

   new laws mandating greater price transparency for health care goods and
   services. Four studies reveal that consumers believe that lifesaving
   health goods are priced according to perceived need (i.e.,
   communal-sharing principles) and that price consequently influences risk
   perceptions and intentions to consume care. Specifically, consumers
   believe that lower medication prices signal greater accessibility to
   anyone in need, and such accessibility thus makes them feel that their
   own self-risk is elevated, increasing consumption. The reverse is true
   for higher prices. Importantly, these effects are limited to
   self-relevant health threats and reveal that consumers make inconsistent
   assumptions about risk, prevalence, and need with price exposure. These
   findings suggest that while greater price transparency may indeed reduce
   consumption of higher-priced goods, it may do so for both necessary and
   unnecessary care.

   consumers consistently showed hedonic elevation in product-evoked
   emotions before purchase, followed by hedonic decline after purchase.
   Low-materialism consumers, however, did not display this pattern.
   Findings show that hedonic elevation appears to be due to expectations
   among high-materialism consumers that purchase of the desired product
   will transform their lives in significant and meaningful ways. Findings
   further indicate that satisfaction processes may partially explain the
   hedonic decline that follows purchase among high-materialism consumers
   but also suggest that for these consumers, the state of anticipating and

AB Norm violations disrupt social order, and according to prior research,
   social order can be restored through the punishment of norm violators.
   Based on this conceptual framework, the current research examines a
   prevalent yet overlooked behavior in the consumer literature by showing
   that consumers play an active role in making punishment decisions.
   Importantly, this article highlights three factors that affect the
   balance in social order and thus are critical in consumer-to-consumer
   punishment decisions. First, when a third party in the consumption
   environment restores social order through punishment, consumers will
   refrain from punishing further (study 1). Second, punishment is
   mitigated when the norm violator faces an unjustified adversity, as
   punishment would create a further imbalance in social order (studies 2a
   and 2b). Third, the level of punishment required to achieve social order
   is reduced for a higher status norm violator (study 3). Finally, this
   article identifies multiple avenues for future research that build on
   the current work.

   predictions of the valuation of others in the same role when either (a)

AB Online social networks are used by hundreds of millions of people every
   day, but little is known about their effect on behavior. In five
   experiments, the authors demonstrate that social network use enhances
   self-esteem in users who are focused on close friends (i.e., strong
   ties) while browsing their social network. This momentary increase in
   self-esteem reduces self-control, leading those focused on strong ties
   to display less self-control after browsing a social network.
   Additionally, the authors present evidence suggesting that greater
   social network use is associated with a higher body mass index and
   higher levels of credit card debt for individuals with strong ties to
   their social network. This research extends previous findings by
   demonstrating that social networks primarily enhance self-esteem for
   those focused on strong ties during social network use. Additionally,
   this research has implications for policy makers because self-control is
   an important mechanism for maintaining social order and well-being.

AB Consumer research largely examines television advertising effects using
   conventional psychological accounts of message processing. Consequently,
   there is an emphasis on the influence of textual content at the expense
   of the everyday interpersonal viewing contexts surrounding advertising
   audiences. To help restore this theoretical imbalance an ethnographic
   study was conducted in eight Australian homes to explore the influence
   of everyday viewing contexts on advertising audiences. This article
   examines how the everyday advertising contexts of social interaction,
   viewing space, media technology use, and time impact consumer responses
   to television advertising texts. Advertising viewing behavior in the
   family living room is framed within broader household activity and
   around cultural ideas regarding family life, and can enhance consumer
   and family identity value. Our theoretical framework details how
   television advertisements, everyday viewing contexts, household
   discourse, and viewer practices intersect to produce processes of
   advertising response and engagement not explicated in previous studies
   of consumer behavior.

AB This research examines the effects of social exclusion on a critical
   aspect of consumer behavior, financial decision-making. Specifically,
   four lab experiments and one field survey uncover how feeling isolated
   or ostracized causes consumers to pursue riskier but potentially more
   profitable financial opportunities. These daring proclivities do not
   appear driven by impaired affect or self-esteem. Rather, interpersonal
   rejection exacerbates financial risk-taking by heightening the
   instrumentality of money (as a substitute for popularity) to obtain
   benefits in life. Invariably, the quest for wealth that ensues tends to
   adopt a riskier but potentially more lucrative road. The article
   concludes by discussing the implications of its findings for behavioral
   research as well as for societal and individual welfare.

   self-view is associated with abstract representations of future events
   and with perceiving these events as happening in the more distant
   future, whereas an interdependent self-view is associated with concrete
   representations of future events and with perceiving these events as
   happening in the more proximal future. Furthermore, a match (vs.
   mismatch) between the temporal frame of an advertisement and the
   self-view of the recipient leads to systematic changes in advertisement
   effectiveness and product appeal. These results add to the construal
   level theory and the self literatures and have practical implications

AB Previous research uses categorization principles to analyze the

   employs categorization principles to analyze the interplay between
   individuals and products. It proposes that consumers classify owned (but

   Consequently, consumers judge product traits (e. g., masculinity) as
   consistent with their own traits (assimilation) if they own the product,
   but as inconsistent with their own traits (contrast) if they interact
   with the product but do not own it, even when owning the product is
   nondiagnostic of its properties (e. g., following random ownership
   assignment; experiments 2-4). For example, less creative consumers who
   enter a drawing for an iPhone may judge it as less creative
   (assimilation) if they win the product, but as more creative (contrast)
   if they do not win the product. Moderators of these effects are
   identified, and their theoretical and substantive implications are

AB In the context of do-it-yourself (DIY) home improvement, this article
   extends theorizing on productive consumption, domestic masculinity, and
   social class. Based on interviews with informants varying in cultural
   capital endowments, the findings reveal that productive consumption
   shapes domestic masculinity in relation to class-mediated identity
   conflicts and ideals. Among high-cultural-capital (HCC) informants, DIY
   home improvement counters the burdens of knowledge work. The suburban
   home materializes as a leisurely venue for productive consumption where
   HCC informants fashion themselves as suburban-craftsmen involved in
   autotherapeutic labor. Low-cultural-capital (LCC) informants'
   involvement in DIY home improvement is animated by a different identity
   conflict and identity ideal. Due to limits on fulfilling normative
   expectations for economic provisioning, LCC informants liken home to a
   workplace. Through productive consumption at home, LCC informants enact
   an identity ideal of family-handyman, thus fashioning themselves as
   rightful, masculine family stewards.

   congruent with the moral foundations of liberals and conservatives.
   Study 3 demonstrated that enhanced fluency represents the underlying

AB Prior research examining how negative feelings influence aesthetic
   preferences (e. g., liking of different kinds of music, movies, or
   stories) has reported inconsistent findings. This article proposes a
   theoretical argument to explain when people are more likely to prefer
   mood-congruent to mood-incongruent aesthetic stimuli. It is suggested
   that mood-congruent aesthetic experiences, for example, listening to sad
   songs when feeling sad, (a) serve as a surrogate for the mood-sharing
   often observed in empathic relationships and hence (b) are preferred
   when emotional distress comes from failing interpersonal relationships
   (vs. noninterpersonal events). Consistent with this proposition,
   people's preferences for mood-congruent music strongly correlate with
   their preferences for an empathic friend (experiment 1). Further,
   mood-congruent preferences significantly increase when people experience
   interpersonal (vs. noninterpersonal) distress, independent of emotional
   intensity, emotion type (sadness and frustration/anger), and normative
   issues (experiments 1-3). Further theoretical developments and future
   research are discussed.

   the future is visualized on the right. Across four studies, the current

   conceptualization of time affects attitudes toward time-related
   products. Specifically, when consumers view advertisements in which
   product images are positioned congruently (incongruently) with their
   spatial representation of time, they have more (less) favorable
   attitudes toward the product. This effect occurs for both products that
   naturally involve the progression of time (e.g., self-improvement
   products) and also products for which a time component is a desired
   attribute (e.g., antiques). The effect of horizontal position reverses
   among consumers who read from right to left. The mediating role of

AB Past research has shown the robustness of egocentric anchoring or false
   consensus effects (e.g., Naylor, Lamberton, and Norton; Ross, Greene,
   and House) primarily in situations where consumers adopt a cooperative
   or neutral stance toward one another. However, competition among
   consumers is a ubiquitous part of Western culture. Across five
   experiments in competitive contexts (either a dictator game or an online
   auction), interpersonal ambiguity leads to an inference of
   dissimilarity, rather than similarity. As a result, consumers compete as
   aggressively against ambiguous others as they do against dissimilar
   others. This effect occurs regardless of brand quality, seller
   reputation, or number of other competitors in the auction. A final study
   demonstrates that aggressiveness may be directed toward the seller
   rather than other bidders when sellers are ambiguous or dissimilar. This
   work therefore offers an important boundary condition for the operation
   of egocentric tendencies, highlighting the pervasive effect of
   competitive contexts on consumer behavior.

   question revealed that people with a more interdependent (vs.
   independent) cultural self-construal-operationalized by ethnicity,
   nationality, measured self-construal, or manipulated salient
   self-construal-have a greater tendency to use price information to judge
   quality. This difference arises because interdependents tend to be
   holistic (vs. analytic) thinkers who are more likely to perceive
   interrelations between the elements of a product. These effects were
   observed regardless of whether the price-quality relation was assessed
   with a standard self-report scale or via actual product judgments, and
   whether thinking style was measured or manipulated. However, cultural

AB After having made a purchase decision, consumers often revisit their

   satisfaction with the selected alternative, especially when choices are
   difficult. We introduce the concept of "choice closure"-defined as the
   psychological process by which consumers come to perceive a decision to
   be final-and show that specific physical acts that are metaphorically
   associated with the concept of closure (such as covering or turning a
   page on the rejected alternatives) trigger choice closure in the context
   of difficult choices. Four studies show that performing acts of closure
   inhibits consumers' propensity to reconsider their decision process and
   to engage in unfavorable comparisons between the chosen and the forgone
   options, resulting in greater satisfaction with the outcome of choices
   made from large sets. These findings suggest that subtle cues, which do
   not alter the actual choice context, can improve satisfaction with a

   that the more proximal is the distance between the image of a potential
   cause (e.g., a facial cream that treats acne) and that of the potential
   effect (e.g., a smooth face), the more effective the product is judged
   to be. The reliance on spatial proximity is an intuitive reasoning
   process based on the "closeness is strength of effect" metaphor, which
   is a key characteristic in mechanical causal processes. This reliance on
   spatial proximity is weakened when consumers are more (vs. less)
   knowledgeable about a product domain, when they are primed with

AB Despite the common belief that seating arrangements matter, little

   can affect persuasion. Across three studies, this research demonstrates
   that the shape of seating arrangements can prime two fundamental human
   needs that in turn influence persuasion. When seated in a
   circular-shaped layout, individuals evaluate persuasive material more
   favorably when it contains family-oriented cues or majority endorsement
   information. In contrast, when seated in an angular-shaped seating
   arrangement, individuals evaluate persuasive material more favorably
   when it contains self-oriented cues or minority endorsement. Further,
   results reveal that these responses to persuasive material arise because
   circular (angular) shaped seating arrangements prime a need to belong
   (need to be unique). Thus, this research shows that a subtle
   environmental cue-the shape of a seating arrangement-can activate
   fundamental human needs and consequently affect persuasion.

AB Surveys in the social sciences often employ rating scales anchored by
   response category labels such as "strongly (dis)agree" or "completely

   responses since they are common to all items, academic research on the
   effect of different labels is surprisingly scarce. In order to help
   researchers choose appropriate category labels, we contrast the
   intensity hypothesis (which posits that response categories are endorsed
   less frequently if the labels are more extreme) with the familiarity
   hypothesis (which states that response categories are endorsed more
   frequently if the labels are more common in day-to-day language). In a
   series of studies we find consistent support for the familiarity
   hypothesis. Our results have important implications for the appropriate
   use of category labels in multilingual surveys, and we propose a
   procedure based on Internet search engine hits to equate labels in
   different languages in terms of familiarity.

AB The extended self was proposed in 1988. Since it was formulated, many
   technological changes have dramatically affected the way we consume,
   present ourselves, and communicate. This conceptual update seeks to
   revitalize the concept, incorporate the impacts of digitization, and
   provide an understanding of consumer sense of self in today's
   technological environment. It is necessarily a work in progress, for the
   digital environment and our behavior within it continue to evolve. But
   some important changes are already clear. Five changes with digital
   consumption are considered that impact the nature of self and the nature
   of possessions. Needed modifications and additions to the extended self
   are outlined, and directions for future research are suggested. The
   digital world opens a host of new means for self-extension, using many
   new consumption objects to reach a vastly broader audience. Even though
   this calls for certain reformulations, the basic concept of the extended
   self remains vital.

AB This article documents single-option aversion, an increase in consumers'
   desire to search when faced with a single option. This effect can lead
   to a product being chosen more often when competing alternatives are
   included in the choice set, contrary to various rational models of
   search, as well as to recent research on choice conflict showing that
   additional options can lead to higher deferral rates. A series of lab
   studies document this effect, differentiate it from other context
   effects, and test some of its boundary conditions. The results suggest
   that single-option aversion is not driven by the information provided by
   the additional options, that the desire to search is critical for this
   effect to occur, and that the effects of single-option aversion are not
   limited to the immediate choice set. These results have both practical
   and theoretical implications for the understanding of consumer search
   and choice deferral.

AB Consumers share word of mouth face to face, over social media, and
   through a host of other communication channels. But do these channels
   affect what people talk about and, if so, how? Laboratory experiments,
   as well as analysis of almost 20,000 everyday conversations, demonstrate
   that communicating via oral versus written communication affects the
   products and brands consumers discuss. Compared to oral communication,
   written communication leads people to mention more interesting products
   and brands. Further, this effect is driven by communication asynchrony
   and self-enhancement concerns. Written communication gives people more
   time to construct and refine what to say, and self-enhancement motives
   lead people to use this opportunity to mention more interesting things.
   These findings shed light on how communication channels shape
   interpersonal communication and the psychological drivers of word of
   mouth more broadly.

AB This article explores the effects of two distinct retail choice
   architectures-those that organize assortments by attributes and those
   that organize items by benefits. Relative to attribute-based
   organizations, benefit-based organizations lead to more abstract
   construal and heighten similarity perceptions among items in an
   assortment. Such changes in similarity perceptions alter consumers'
   strength of preference among items: when choosing from benefit-as
   opposed to attribute-based organizations, consumers select lower-priced
   items and are more similarly satisfied with their top choice as with a
   lower-ranked option. Further, consumers' internal shopping objectives
   and orientations cued by the external organization may interact in ways
   that heighten similarity perceptions. Results suggest that abstract
   construal cues, regardless of whether they arise internally or
   externally, may dominate concrete cues in the type of shopping context
   under consideration.

AB Prior research on consumer response to preferential treatment has
   focused on treatment that has been earned through loyalty or effort, and
   most of this work has reported positive outcomes for recipients.
   Unearned preferential treatment (e.g., receiving a surprise discount,
   getting a free upgrade), in contrast, has received little attention. The
   current research demonstrates that, although receiving unearned
   preferential treatment does generate positive reactions, it is not
   always an entirely pleasurable experience. Results from four experiments
   show that when unearned preferential treatment is received in front of
   others, the positive feelings of appreciation for the treatment can be
   accompanied by feelings of social discomfort stemming from concerns
   about being judged negatively by other customers. These feelings of
   discomfort can reduce satisfaction with a shopping experience and affect
   purchasing behaviors. The negative impact of unearned preferential
   treatment on satisfaction is moderated by the characteristics and
   reactions of those observers.

AB There are many opportunities in everyday life to associate consumer
   products with success or failure. For example, when a basketball fan
   drinks a particular brand of soda while watching her favorite team win a
   game, she may perceive that this consumption facilitated the victory.
   Subsequently, the fan may continue to purchase and consume this same
   item during future games, in an attempt to help the team. This behavior
   is known as "conditioned superstition." Data from five experiments
   indicate that preference for lucky products (i.e., those associated with
   positive outcomes) increases with higher levels of desire for control
   combined with lower levels of perceived ability to control outcomes
   (e.g., low generalized self-efficacy). People who express a preference
   for these lucky products form an illusion of control over future
   outcomes, so that they perceive superstitious behavior to be an
   effective strategy to achieve the desired result.

AB Consumers often need to decide if they want to reengage a goal, such as
   a goal of losing weight, a goal of saving money, or a goal of performing
   well on a video game. This research finds that consumers are more likely
   to reengage a goal when they have set a high-low range goal (e.g., lose
   2-4 pounds this week) than when they have set a single number goal
   (e.g., lose 3 pounds this week). This effect is driven by the greater
   attainability and greater challenge of the high-low range goal, which
   then leads to a greater feeling of accomplishment. Thus, these findings
   suggest that in order to keep a consumer motivated over time to continue
   with an activity or continue using a product, that consumer should first
   set or be given a high-low range goal.

AB The discrepancy between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to

   been investigated and replicated across various domains because of its
   implications for rational decision making. The authors assume that
   implicit processes operate in the endowment effect and propose an
   explanation that is derived from the two main accounts of the effect,
   ownership and loss aversion. Based on the implicit egotism and
   self-affirmation literatures, the model argues that selling is perceived
   as an implicit self-threat and that sellers, as a part of their
   automatic defense mechanism, respond to this self-threat by enhancing
   the value of the self-associated object. Five studies test these
   conjectures and provide support for the proposed model.

AB Many hedonic experiences consist of a temporal sequence of episodes,
   such as viewing a series of paintings in an art gallery. These events
   may be shared with others (joint context) or experienced alone (solo
   context). However, past research has mostly studied solo contexts,
   finding that consumers evaluate experiences with an improving trend more
   positively than those with a declining trend, due to a recency effect in
   memory-based evaluations. The present research investigates the
   moderating role of social context on global evaluations of experiences.
   Participants instructed to undergo hedonic experiences presented as an
   improving or declining trend replicated the greater evaluation of
   improving sequences in solo contexts, but demonstrated an attenuation of
   this preference in joint contexts. These differences occur because joint
   experiences trigger a more holistic (less analytic) processing style,
   contributing to primacy-based assimilation, in which evaluations of
   later episodes assimilate to first impressions (i.e., evaluations of the
   start).

AB This article maintains that power enhances consumers' ability to resist
   social influence but produces different resistance outcomes, depending
   on the level of certainty with which consumers hold their own attitudes.
   When attitude certainty is high, empowered consumers resist social
   influence by discounting others' opinions. When attitude certainty is
   low, empowered consumers intentionally diverge from others' opinions to
   signal their independence. Data from the first two experiments provide
   consistent support for the dual impact of power. The last two
   experiments examine the processes leading to the reactant response.
   Experiment 3 finds that the experience of uncertainty weakens empowered
   consumers' confidence in their sense of power, leading them to perceive
   others' unsolicited opinions as a threat to their autonomy, which then
   triggers the reactant response. Finally, consistent with a
   self-presentation interpretation of reactance, experiment 4 finds that
   power leads to reactance when evaluations are public but not when they
   are private.

AB How does controversy affect conversation? Five studies using both field
   and laboratory data address this question. Contrary to popular belief,
   controversial things are not necessarily more likely to be discussed.
   Controversy increases likelihood of discussion at low levels, but beyond
   a moderate level of controversy, additional controversy actually
   decreases likelihood of discussion. The controversy-conversation
   relationship is driven by two countervailing processes. Controversy
   increases interest (which increases likelihood of discussion) but
   simultaneously increases discomfort (which decreases likelihood of
   discussion). Contextual factors such as anonymity and whether people are
   talking to friends or strangers moderate the controversy-conversation
   relationship by impacting these component processes. Our framework sheds
   light on how, when, and why controversy affects whether or not things

   turn reinforces materialism. It provides evidence that materialism and
   loneliness are engaged in bidirectional relationships over time.
   Importantly, it finds that loneliness contributes more to materialism
   than the other way around. Moreover, it finds that materialism's
   contribution to loneliness is not uniformly vicious but critically
   differs between specific subtypes of materialism. That is, valuing
   possessions as a happiness medicine or as a success measure increased
   loneliness, and these subtypes also increased most due to loneliness.
   Yet seeking possessions for material mirth decreased loneliness and was
   unaffected by it. These findings are based on longitudinal data from
   over 2,500 consumers across 6 years and a new latent growth model. They
   reveal how materialism and loneliness form a self-perpetuating vicious
   and virtuous cycle depending on the materialism subtype.

AB While a substantial body of research suggests that belongingness needs
   motivate consumers to use brands to assimilate with a reference group,
   relatively less attention has been devoted to understanding when and why

   current research fills this gap in the literature and identifies two
   ways individuals can differentiate themselves from the group through the
   use of brands: horizontal and vertical differentiation. Horizontal
   brands offer differentiation through the expression of personality,
   taste, traits, and so forth, whereas vertical brands offer
   differentiation by conferring status or demonstrating one's superiority
   to others in a group. The results reveal that under social exclusion
   (inclusion), low self-esteem consumers increase perceptions of group
   heterogeneity (seek to protect their future belongingness) and
   subsequently increase their attachment to horizontal (vertical) brands.
   Overall, the results suggest that the belongingness goals of low

   four laboratory studies demonstrate that a consumer's decision to
   recycle a product or throw it in the trash can be determined by the
   extent to which the product has been distorted during the consumption
   process. Specifically, if the consumption process distorts a product
   sufficiently from its original form (i.e., changes in size or form),
   consumers perceive it as less useful and in turn are more likely to
   throw it in the garbage (as opposed to recycle it). These findings point

   purchase. This research demonstrates that consumers' willingness to pay
   for the product after the promotion is retracted is higher when it was
   offered for free than when it was offered at a low, discounted price.
   The underlying reasoning is that the price of the product on promotion
   is used as a natural anchor for value estimation. However, when the
   product is offered for free (i.e., zero price), consumers are less
   likely to consider the value of the product and are influenced by
   anchors such as the price of the focal purchase. In contrast to some
   prior findings, a free offer does not devalue the product at all and, at
   a minimum, devalues the product less than if it were offered for a low,

AB When consumers anticipate feeling embarrassed by a purchase, they often
   purchase additional products to mitigate the threat. The current
   research demonstrates that nonembarrassing additional purchases do not
   necessarily attenuate anticipated embarrassment but may, paradoxically,
   exacerbate it instead. Results further show that when additional
   purchases do attenuate anticipated embarrassment, they can do so
   independently of their effect on the salience of the embarrassing
   product. Five experiments provide converging evidence that additional
   purchases attenuate (vs. exacerbate) anticipated embarrassment to the
   extent that they are perceived to counterbalance (vs. complement) the
   undesired identity communicated during purchase. These results contrast
   with the traditional explanation for this strategy, which holds that
   additional purchases mitigate embarrassment because they compete with
   the embarrassing product for observers' attention. This research
   contributes to a more precise understanding of consumer coping and
   impression management by identifying shopping basket composition as an

AB The current research explores how the structure of a goal, more
   specifically whether its completion requires completing a set of actions
   in a fixed sequence or in a flexible order, influences consumers'
   decision to adopt the goal and how individuals actually fare once they
   have initiated the goal pursuit. Four experiments demonstrated that
   although the requirement to complete all goal-related actions following
   a fixed sequence discourages consumers from adopting the goal, this
   rigidity turns out to be more effective in inducing actual goal
   completion. This reversal occurs because consumers are unable to foresee
   the extent to which a fixed goal structure can help reduce the
   difficulty in goal pursuit.

AB Figurative language in advertising affects product attitudes positively
   across contexts. In contrast, the present research demonstrates that the
   use and effectiveness of figurative language in consumer-generated
   content is context specific, because of conversational norms unique to
   this form of communication. Study 1 shows that consumer reviews
   containing more figurative language lead to more favorable attitudes in
   hedonic, but not utilitarian, consumption contexts, and that
   conversational norms about figurative language govern this effect. Study
   2 reveals that reading a review containing figurative language increases
   choice of hedonic over utilitarian options. Finally, via analysis of
   online consumer reviews and a lab experiment, studies 3 and 4 indicate
   that consumers use figurative language more when sharing experiences
   about hedonic than utilitarian consumption, and that review extremity
   influences figurative language use only in reviews of hedonic
   consumption. The studies highlight the critical role of conversational
   norms in interpreting and creating user-generated content.

AB This research investigates how observers react when they see someone
   else being given a compliment that is flattering but that appears
   sincere. Prior work suggests that to the extent the compliment is
   perceived to be genuine, observers will not judge the source negatively.
   Merging insights from social comparison research and dual attitudes
   theory, this article presents a novel conceptualization of observer
   reactions to flattery. Specifically, while observers' deliberative
   attitudes toward apparently sincere flattery may be positive, a
   spontaneous process of comparing oneself with the target will produce an
   implicit negative reaction rooted in the unpleasant sensation of envy.
   This conceptualization yields a host of related implications,
   successfully predicting observers' reactions toward insincere as well as
   sincere flattery and toward the flattery target as well its source, and
   also explaining how their envy-based negative reaction may ironically
   induce observers to behave in a manner consistent with the flatterer's
   interests. Convergent findings across four experiments provide a
   multifaceted understanding of observer reactions to flattery, while also
   informing the literature on social comparison and envy.

AB Although materialism is linked to self-control failure, the underlying
   process remains unclear. By manipulating materialistic thoughts via
   state-sponsored lotteries, this research examines why materialism may
   undermine self-control. Across four studies, this research demonstrates
   that entering a lottery tends to activate materialistic thoughts and
   that these thoughts generally constitute low-level construal, which, in
   turn, results in self-control failure. This effect is moderated by the
   degree to which people are oriented toward extrinsic values. In
   addition, when materialistic thoughts are diverted, entering a lottery
   has no effect on self-control. In summary, this research highlights that
   materialism, although stable and enduring, can manifest itself in a
   burst of materialistic thoughts. The research provides important
   implications for research on materialism, self-control, and mental
   construal.

AB The purpose of this article is to understand how media frames affect
   consumer judgments of legitimacy. Because frames exist on the
   sociocultural and individual level, our research takes a multimethod
   approach to this question. On the sociocultural level, we conduct a
   content analysis of operant media frames for discussing online gambling
   and perform an event analysis, finding that a shift in consumer
   judgments follows an abrupt shift in frame. Then, on the individual
   level, the causal mechanism for these shifts is investigated in an
   experimental setting using the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These
   experiments show that framing affects normative legitimacy judgments by
   changing implicit associations. Further, users and nonusers respond
   differently to frame elements, with users favoring an established frame
   and nonusers favoring a novel, legitimating frame. This suggests that
   media frames play a critical role in establishing legitimacy at the
   sociocultural level and that framing potentially bridges cognitive and
   normative legitimacy.

AB Stories, and their ability to transport their audience, constitute a
   central part of human life and consumption experience. Integrating
   previous literature derived from fields as diverse as anthropology,
   marketing, psychology, communication, consumer, and literary studies,
   this article offers a review of two decades worth of research on
   narrative transportation, the phenomenon in which consumers mentally
   enter a world that a story evokes. Despite the relevance of narrative
   transportation for storytelling and narrative persuasion, extant
   contributions seem to lack systematization. The authors conceive the
   extended transportation-imagery model, which provides not only a
   comprehensive model that includes the antecedents and consequences of
   narrative transportation but also a multidisciplinary framework in which
   cognitive psychology and consumer culture theory cross-fertilize this
   field of inquiry. The authors test the model using a quantitative
   meta-analysis of 132 effect sizes of narrative transportation from 76
   published and unpublished articles and identify fruitful directions for
   further research.

   stronger price unfairness when paying more than other consumers do,
   whereas low-power consumers perceive stronger unfairness when paying
   more than they themselves paid in previous transactions. The distinction
   occurs because consumers experience a threat to their self-importance
   from different types of disadvantaged comparisons depending on their

   markets from consumption activity. The exceptions conceptualize market
   emergence as a product of consumer struggle against prevailing market
   logics. This study develops a model of consumption-driven market
   emergence in harmony with existing market offerings. Using ethnographic
   methods and actor-network theory the authors chronicle the emergence of
   a new market within the motorcycle industry that develops with neither
   active participation nor interference from mainstream industry players.
   Findings reveal a process of multiple translations wherein consumers
   mobilize human and nonhuman actors to co-constitute products, practices,
   and infrastructures. These drive the growth of interlinked communities
   of practice, which ultimately are translated into a fully functioning
   market. The study highlights the roles of distributed innovation and

AB This article builds a conceptualization for the crossmodal effect of
   attention on preferences, predicting when and why an irrelevant auditory
   signal will facilitate or impair preferences for visually processed
   target products located in the direction of the signal. Extending
   perspectives on crossmodal attention, this conceptualization posits that
   the functional tendency to pay visual attention toward an auditory
   signal will translate to a facilitation effect on preferences. However,
   given a goal of signal avoidance, crossmodal functionality dictates a
   lowering of visual attention toward the signal, impairing preferences
   for targets in that direction. Finally, a two-stage model of involuntary
   and voluntary attention is invoked to reconcile opposing predictions: an
   aversive noise is held to produce initial facilitation because of an
   involuntary appraisal mechanism, before a more deliberative
   attention-allocation process produces impairment. Results from five
   experiments support these predictions, contributing to the literature on
   crossmodal information processing and also that on preference formation.

AB Past research shows that luxury products can function to boost
   self-esteem, express identity, and signal status. We propose that luxury
   products also have important signaling functions in relationships.
   Whereas men use conspicuous luxury products to attract mates, women use
   such products to deter female rivals. Drawing on both evolutionary and
   cultural perspectives, five experiments investigated how women's luxury
   products function as a signaling system directed at other women who pose
   threats to their romantic relationships. Findings showed that activating
   a motive to guard one's mate triggered women to seek and display lavish
   possessions. Additional studies revealed that women use pricey
   possessions to signal that their romantic partner is especially devoted
   to them. In turn, flaunting designer handbags and shoes was effective at
   deterring other women from poaching a relationship partner. This
   research identifies a novel function of conspicuous consumption,
   revealing that luxury products and brands play important roles in

AB Place attachment is one's strong emotional bond with a specific

   pays little attention to commercial settings. This is because they are
   seen as too insipid to rouse attachment. Consumer research, however,
   suggests otherwise. To address this disparity, the authors investigate
   how people develop, experience, and act on place attachment in
   commercial settings. Findings from consumer in-depth interviews and
   self-reports conducted in France reveal that place attachment develops
   through perceptions of familiarity, authenticity, and security and
   evolves into experiences of homeyness. Consumers find these encounters
   of homeyness extraordinary and respond by engaging in volunteering,
   over-reciprocation, and ambassadorship toward the place. The authors
   further theorize these findings through a gift economy perspective and
   identify a tripartite exchange between the consumer, the proprietor of
   the place, and selected people from the consumer's social network.

AB This article introduces time anthropomorphism: a tendency to imbue time
   with humanlike mental states (e.g., time has a will of its own). This
   tendency, which varies across individuals and may also be induced,
   changes patience (e.g., for standard over expedited shipping).
   Specifically, time anthropomorphism reduces patience for low-power (but
   not high-power) individuals because anthropomorphism makes the aversive
   force of wait time seem more potent (i.e., more aversive) to those who
   feel less potent themselves (i.e., low-power individuals). In a field
   study with real money at stake and four experiments, the authors verify
   the effect on patience and confirm the process via both mediation (i.e.,
   the effect is mediated by how aversively time is perceived) and
   moderation (i.e., the effect reverses when time is made to seem
   beneficent). Thus, they introduce time as a consequential
   anthropomorphic entity, present novel effects on intertemporal
   preferences, and delineate a potency process for power.

AB The current research examines how price promotions influence
   postpurchase hedonic consumption experience. On the one hand, getting a
   good deal can elevate moods and dampen the "pain of payment," thus
   enhancing consumption enjoyment. On the other hand, discounts also
   reduce sunk-cost considerations and the need to recover one's spending.
   As a result, price promotions can lower attention during consumption,
   which in turn diminishes consumption enjoyment. The authors posit that
   the time delay between payment and consumption plays an important role
   in determining the relative strength of these competing effects. Four
   experiments involving real spending and consumption demonstrate that
   when consumption occurs immediately after payment, discounts make
   consumption more enjoyable; however, this pattern reverses when
   consumption is delayed. The experiments provide support for the roles of
   feelings and attention, respectively, in accounting for these effects
   while ruling out several alternative explanations, including perceived
   quality, absolute paid price, and a direct sunk-cost account.

AB Customized assembly occurs when a consumer makes customization decisions
   and participates in the construction or modification of a product. While
   customization increases satisfaction with the end-product, less is known
   about the utility derived from the assembly effort. Three studies show
   that the structure of the customized assembly task determines whether
   consumers derive negative or positive utility from the assembly effort.
   When customization decisions and assembly processes are segregated,
   consumers find the assembly process disagreeable. Consequently, more
   assembly effort leads to a lesser appreciation for the assembly
   experience. When customization decisions and assembly processes are
   integrated, consumers become creatively engaged in the assembly process.
   Consequently, more assembly effort leads to a greater appreciation for
   the assembly experience. In each case, the assembly experience
   influences the value of the materials that afforded the experience
   (i.e., the to-be-assembled product). The results have implications for
   repeat purchasing in product categories that allow for coproduction.

   is seen with a brand that has a similar personality. The first two
   experiments provide support for the positive impact of dissimilar brand

   compared to the piecemeal processing of individual textual stimuli,
   affects the processing of the assortment as a whole with visual
   (compared to verbal) presentation facilitating a faster, though more
   haphazard, scanning of the assortment. While the less systematic
   processing that results from visual presentation feels easier, it is not
   ideal for larger assortments resulting in higher complexity ratings and
   choice overload than with text depiction. These findings reveal that,
   like many heuristics, preference for visual depiction may be

AB This research emically documents consumers' experience of the end of a
   favorite television series. Anchored in the domain of evolving narrative
   brands, of which TV series are an archetypal example, this work draws
   from narrative theory, brand relationship theory, and basic research on
   interpersonal loss to document the processes of loss accommodation. The
   authors triangulate across data sources and methods (extended
   participant observation, long interview, and online forum analysis) to
   unfold the processes of loss accommodation triggered by brand
   discontinuation. Accommodation processes and postwithdrawal relationship
   trajectories depend upon the nature and closural force of the narrative
   inherent to the brand but also the sociality that surrounds its
   consumption. Consumption sociality allows access to transitive and
   connective resources that facilitate the processes of accommodation
   during critical junctures in consumer-brand relationships.

AB Much of the existing literature on psychological distance has focused on
   cognitive outcomes, such as changes in construal level, largely framing
   affective processes out of the discussion. The current research examines
   the distinct influences of psychological distance and construal level on
   affect-based evaluation. In a first set of experiments, psychological
   distance (vs. closeness) reduces the intensity of felt affect, while
   abstract (vs. concrete) thinking increases the positivity of one's
   thoughts. In a second set of experiments, psychological distance
   improves evaluations of negative experiences by reducing the intensity
   of negative affect but hurts evaluations of positive experiences by
   reducing the intensity of positive affect. By contrast, abstract
   thinking increases positivity, improving evaluations for both positive
   and negative experiences alike. These findings have implications for
   marketing communication strategy and existing theories of psychological
   distance.

AB Prior research offers competing predictions regarding whether an initial
   token display of support for a cause (such as wearing a ribbon, signing
   a petition, or joining a Facebook group) subsequently leads to increased
   and otherwise more meaningful contributions to the cause. The present
   research proposes a conceptual framework elucidating two primary
   motivations that underlie subsequent helping behavior: a desire to
   present a positive image to others and a desire to be consistent with
   one's own values. Importantly, the socially observable nature (public
   vs. private) of initial token support is identified as a key moderator
   that influences when and why token support does or does not lead to
   meaningful support for the cause. Consumers exhibit greater helping on a
   subsequent, more meaningful task after providing an initial private (vs.
   public) display of token support for a cause. Finally, the authors
   demonstrate how value alignment and connection to the cause moderate the

AB Motivated forgetting is a psychological defense mechanism whereby people
   cope with threatening and unwanted memories by suppressing them from
   consciousness. A series of laboratory experiments investigate whether
   social identity threat can motivate people subsequently to forget
   identity-linked marketing promotions. To this effect, whereas social
   identity priming improves memory for identity-linked promotions, priming
   coupled with social identity threat (i.e., negative identity-related
   feedback) impairs memory. Importantly, this identity threat effect
   occurs only among people who identify strongly with their in-group and
   only for explicit memory. Implicit memory, in contrast, remains intact
   under threat. Additionally, the identity threat effect is eliminated
   (i.e., explicit memory is restored) if people affirm the threatened
   social identity, thereby mitigating the threat, prior to memory
   retrieval. Finally, the identity threat effect occurs only when
   automatic processes guide forgetting. When forgetting is guided by
   deliberate and controlled processes, the to-be-forgotten memories
   intrude into consciousness.

AB Words prime semantic and conceptually related associates and concepts.
   This article documents a novel route of priming disparate meanings
   relevant to consumer behaviors. Reading processes use word sound, not
   spelling, to activate word meaning in memory. Reading a homophone (e.
   g., "bye")-a word with identical pronunciation as another word but with
   different spelling and meaning-activates meanings and concepts related
   to the complementary homophone (e. g., "buy"). Homophone priming occurs
   when a secondary process fails to suppress activated meanings associated
   with the complementary homophone, which may influence meaning-relevant
   consumer behaviors downstream. Two experiments (with replications)
   demonstrate this effect occurs when consumers experience diminished
   cognitive resources, which reduces the ability to suppress complementary
   homophone meanings. This research identifies word sound as an
   associative link between otherwise unrelated concepts that can result in
   priming of judgments and behavior. Importantly, these results are
   difficult to or associative priming perspective.

AB The use of advertised reference price promotions, such as "regularly
   $119.99, sale price e$39.99," is ubiquitous in the marketplace. Thirty
   years of research supports the conclusion that advertised reference
   prices (e. g., $119.99) exert an influence on consumers' responses to
   offer prices (e. g., $39.99) via their assimilative influence on
   consumers' internal reference prices. The present research provides an
   enriched account of this assimilation process. Specifically, three
   studies show that increasing the overlap in information made accessible
   by the advertised reference price and information made accessible by the
   offer price increases the influence of the information primed by the
   advertised reference price on the construction of the internal reference
   price. Consequently, the offer price is considered more attractive. The
   identification of this process provides insight into additional
   variables that moderate the influence of advertised reference prices on
   downstream deal evaluations. Implications for theory, practice, and
   public policy are discussed.

   For males, there was not a significant interaction between
   image-impairment concern and tie strength on NWOM transmission
   likelihood. In contrast, for females the effect of image-impairment
   concern on NWOM transmission likelihood was stronger for weak ties than
   for strong ties. The robustness of the findings were tested in two
   additional studies by directly manipulating relative concern for self
   versus others and by employing an indirect proxy: interdependent and
   independent self-construal. Self-versus other-focused thoughts mediated
   the joint effect on NWOM transmission.

AB Despite the ubiquity of fateful predictions in consumers' lives, little
   is known about how these forecasts impact subsequent choice. This
   research concerns fate as an inevitable outcome and posits that
   consumers who believe in fate have an implicit theory about the nature
   of fate, such that some consider that their fate is preordained and
   outside of individual influence, whereas others believe that their fate
   is malleable and can be changed. Two studies demonstrate that the choice
   share of an indulgent (vs. virtuous) option increases only among
   consumers who believe that their fate is malleable when an unfavorable
   day ahead is predicted for them. This result appears consistent with an
   argument that they intentionally choose an indulgent option as a
   deliberate strategy to compensate for an unfavorable day ahead. However,
   analysis of verbal protocols points to an incidental nature of indulgent
   choice among those who believe in malleable fate. The research also
   discusses boundary conditions and casts doubt on an alternative
   explanation based on reactance.

AB This research examines how the social context in which gifts are
   selected influences gift choices. Six experiments show that, when givers
   select gifts for multiple recipients, they tend to pass up gifts that
   would be better liked by one or more recipients in favor of giving
   different gifts to each recipient, even when recipients will not compare
   gifts. This overindividuation does not seem to arise because givers
   perceive recipients' preferences differently when they consider them
   together versus separately: although givers' gift selections differ
   between a one-recipient and multiple-recipient context, their
   perceptions of which gifts would be better liked do not. Rather,
   overindividuation seems to arise because givers try to be thoughtful by
   treating each recipient as unique. Consistent with this, givers are more
   likely to overindividuate when they are encouraged to be thoughtful.
   Focusing givers on recipients' preferences reduces overindividuation and
   can help givers select better-liked gifts.

AB Long lists of ranked items, such as Bloomberg Businessweek's rankings of
   MBA programs, are ubiquitous in Western culture, and they are often used
   in consumer decision making. Six studies show that consumers mentally
   subdivide ranked lists into a smaller set of categories and exaggerate
   differences between consecutive items adjacent to category boundaries.
   Further, despite prior work suggesting that people might subjectively
   produce place-value categories (e. g., single digits, the twenties),
   this research shows that consumers interpret ranked lists by generating
   round-number categories ending in zero or five (e. g., top 10, top 25).
   Thus, for example, consumers will more favorably evaluate improvements
   in rank that cross round-number-category boundaries (e. g., shifting
   from rank 11 to rank 10) than improvements in rank that cross
   place-value-category boundaries (e. g., shifting from rank 10 to rank
   9). This phenomenon, labeled the top-ten effect, occurs because round
   numbers are cognitively accessible to consumers due to their prevalent
   use in everyday communication.

   Because experiencing this control threat depletes resources, individuals
   exposed to a disorganized (vs. organized) environment are more likely to
   exhibit self-regulatory failure in subsequent tasks. The results from
   four studies provide support for this hypothesis. Further, they offer
   evidence of the underlying process by demonstrating that a perceived

AB Prior research indicates that experiences bring greater happiness than

   extent to which an experience is ordinary (common and frequent) versus
   extraordinary (uncommon and infrequent). Eight studies examine the
   experiences individuals recall, plan, imagine, and post on Facebook
   finding that the happiness enjoyed from ordinary and extraordinary
   experiences depends on age. Younger people, who view their future as
   extensive, gain more happiness from extraordinary experiences; however,
   ordinary experiences become increasingly associated with happiness as
   people get older, such that they produce as much happiness as
   extraordinary experiences when individuals have limited time remaining.
   Self-definition drives these effects: although extraordinary experiences
   are self-defining throughout ones life span, as people get older they
   increasingly define themselves by the ordinary experiences that comprise
   their daily lives.

   people confer higher status and competence to nonconforming rather than
   conforming individuals. These positive inferences derived from signals
   of nonconformity are mediated by perceived autonomy and moderated by
   individual differences in need for uniqueness in the observers. An
   investigation of boundary conditions demonstrates that the positive

AB This article looks at the trade-offs that gift givers and gift receivers
   make between desirability and feasibility using construal level theory
   as a framework. Focusing on the asymmetric distance from a gift that
   exists within giver-receiver dyads, the authors propose that, unlike
   receivers, givers construe gifts abstractly and therefore weight
   desirability attributes more than feasibility attributes. Support for
   this proposition emerges in studies examining giver and receiver
   mind-sets, as well as giver and receiver evaluations of gifts.
   Furthermore, givers do not choose gifts that maximize receiver happiness
   or other relationship goals even though givers believe they are doing
   so. Finally, the authors demonstrate that while givers are sensitive to
   their distance from the receiver, receivers are not sensitive to this
   distance.

AB Ample research suggests that after engaging in a self-regulatory task,
   people become depleted and are more likely to behave in maladaptive ways
   by yielding to their impulses. However, yielding to impulses may not
   always be maladaptive. This research suggests that when people are
   depleted, they feel more vulnerable when encountering potential danger
   and are therefore more likely to engage in self-protection. Across five
   studies, depleted (vs. nondepleted) participants reported being less
   likely to engage in risky behaviors such as having unprotected sex
   (study 1) and more likely to engage in risk-reduction behaviors such as
   getting tested for kidney diseases and chlamydia (studies 2 and 3).
   Depleted individuals also preferred products that emphasize safety
   (studies 4 and 5). Perceived vulnerability is shown to mediate the
   effect of depletion on self-protective behavior (studies 1 and 2).
   Together, these findings show that yielding to impulses may sometimes
   help attain beneficial and healthful goals.

AB Getting the best has been advocated as an ideal in almost every domain
   of life. We propose that maximizing constitutes a mind-set that may be
   situationally activated and has cross-domain consequences. Specifically,
   we show that the maximizing mind-set amplifies regret and
   dissatisfaction, increases the likelihood of returning and switching
   products, and affects sensory experiences such as taste. The effect of
   the maximizing mind-set occurs only when consumers learn that they do
   not get the best but not when they do in fact get the best. We validate
   our conception of the maximizing mind-set by demonstrating its embrace
   of underlying processes of comparisons and goals.

AB This research examines the interplay of self-construal orientation and
   victim group-membership on prosocial behavior. Whereas consumers primed
   with an independent self-construal demonstrate similar propensities to
   help needy in-group and out-group others, an interdependent orientation
   fosters stronger commitments to aid in-group than out-group members.
   This interaction holds in both individualistic (i.e., the United States)
   and collectivistic (i.e., China) nations and seems driven by a belief
   system. For interdependents, the prospect of helping needy in-group
   (relative to out-group) members heightens the belief that helping others
   contributes to their own personal happiness, which in turn increases
   their propensity to act benevolently. Such in-group/out-group
   distinctions do not seem to operate among independents. The article
   concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of our findings for
   the cross-cultural, intergroup-relations, and prosocial literatures
   before deriving insights for practice.

AB Construal level theory indicates that consumers tend to prefer products
   high in desirability (greater functionality) for distant-future
   decisions but switch their preferences toward products high in
   feasibility (greater usage convenience) for near-future decisions. The
   current research demonstrates that price information, traditionally
   considered as a feasibility cue, can increase consumers' near-future
   preference toward products with greater functionality despite their low
   convenience, leading to preference consistency over time. As the
   underlying mechanism, price information increases the functionality
   importance for near-future decisions due to consumers' enhanced
   value-seeking tendency when seeing price and their lay belief that
   greater functionality represents higher value. Further, when consumers
   are led to believe that greater convenience represents higher value,
   price and the value-seeking tendency result in a greater preference
   toward easy-to-use products for the distant future and lead to
   preference consistency across time as well. Theoretical implications are
   discussed.

AB Previous research has found that children incrementally learn how to
   cope with advertising as they age. The current research investigates
   whether these developmental constraints in advertising knowledge at time
   of exposure have enduring consequences. Results from four experimental
   studies show that childhood exposure to advertisements can lead to
   resilient biased product evaluations that persist into adulthood. Study
   1 demonstrates that positive affect toward ad-related stimuli
   encountered in childhood mediates the relationship between childhood
   advertising exposure and biased evaluations for products associated with
   childhood (but not adulthood) advertising. Study 2 demonstrates stronger
   biases when participants are exposed to childhood advertising cues
   relative to childhood consumption cues. Studies 3 and 4 show that even
   when ability and motivation to correct bias are high, lingering positive
   affect toward childhood ad-related stimuli is a motivational deterrent
   to correct biased product evaluations. Study 4 also shows that biased
   product evaluations can transfer to line extensions.

TI Hedonic Eating Goals and Emotion: When Sadness Decreases the Desire to
   Indulge

AB This article uses the functionalist perspective of emotion to
   demonstrate that the influence of sadness on indulgent consumption
   depends on the presence of a hedonic eating goal. Sadness heightens a
   persons sensitivity to the potentially harmful consequences of indulgent
   consumption, which decreases indulgence when a hedonic eating goal is
   salient. As sadness is often associated with a loss, this protective
   function is geared toward preventing future losses. The execution of
   this function is mitigated by feelings of safety, a counterforce to
   concerns about the harmful consequences of goal pursuit. Alternatively,
   when a hedonic eating goal is not salient, or a salient goal does not
   have harmful consequences, sadness results in emotion regulation (i.e.,
   indulging as a means of feeling better). This conceptualization and
   findings show that the effects of emotions on indulgent consumption can
   be goal-dependent, and that emotions can aid consumers in the balancing
   of long-term goals and well-being
