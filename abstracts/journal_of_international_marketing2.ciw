TI Performance Effects of Global Account Coordination Mechanisms: An
   Integrative Study of Boundary Conditions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Although many multinational companies have instituted global account management (GAM) programs to coordinate selling activities to better serve and retain their key global customers, evidence of the effectiveness of their GAM coordination efforts is elusive. Viewing GAM coordination as an organizational design issue in managing vertical procurement relationships, the authors draw on global marketing strategy, organizational design, and relationship marketing theories to study how the performances of GAM coordination mechanisms vary with a host of strategic, relational, and environmental conditions. The conceptual model is tested using data collected from a cross-national sample of more than 200 global account managers. The results show that although GAM relational coordination and GAM operational coordination both have positive effects on GAM performance, they do not perform uniformly well under various boundary conditions. In other words, the performance of a GAM coordination mechanism depends on its fit with the operating context.

TI The Influence of Regulatory Focus on Global Consumption Orientation and
   Preference for Global Versus Local Consumer Culture Positioning
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Firms increasingly employ global and local consumer culture positioning strategies (GCCP/LCCP), but understanding of the drivers that underlie consumer responses to such strategies is limited, leaving firms with little guidance on when to choose one strategy over another. To shed light on consumer preference for GCCP versus LCCP, the authors examine the effects of regulatory focus (promotion and prevention orientation) and global consumption orientation (GCO) on preference for GCCP/LCCP. They report the results of three studies: the first is based on a survey with samples drawn from the United States and China, and the second and third are behavioral designs manipulating situational promotion and prevention regulatory focus. The findings suggest that promotion focus is positively related to GCO and prevention focus is negatively related to GCO. Furthermore, the authors find that GCO is positively related to a preference for GCCP. Thus, this research offers a unique perspective by introducing regulatory focus to the GCCP literature, identifying GCO as an important mediator, and demonstrating that regulatory focus can be situationally activated.

TI Brand Image Evaluations: The Interactive Roles of Country of
   Manufacture, Brand Concept, and Vertical Line Extension Type
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Country-of-origin research has provided inconsistent findings about how the country of manufacture (COM) affects brand image evaluations. The authors examine how the COM, vertical line extension (VLE) type, and brand concept interactively affect brand image evaluations after brands introduce products in their existing product categories. The authors draw on schema congruity theory to develop a conceptual framework and confirm it using experimental methods. Results from a sample of U.S. consumers demonstrate that the COM's influence on brand image should be considered in conjunction with the type of VLE strategy and the intended conceptual meaning of a brand. Manufacturing in a country with a favorable image does not always improve brand image evaluations. Functional brands can improve their image with an upward VLE regardless of the COM; however, if these brands pursue a downward VLE, the COM has little to no effect. For prestige brands, downward VLEs result in lower postextension brand image regardless of the COM. However, a favorable COM appears to soften the negative effect of downward VLE on postextension brand image evaluations.

TI A Memory-Theory Perspective of Country-Image Formation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Traditional country-of-origin strategy in international marketing uses a country-image halo to cue beliefs about the country's products. With expansive trade globalization, domestic consumers are likely to have experience with foreign products but know little of the products' origin country. Thus, equally important as traditional theory is the question of whether product beliefs can imbue country image, but little is known of this reverse influence. If product beliefs can generalize into a favorable country image, a chain effect will then enable traditional country-of-origin effects to benefit the country's other products. In this study, the results of three surveys across two countries show that product beliefs can indeed influence country image. However, the influence weakens with increasing country familiarity and exists only when the product and country are congruent. Furthermore, the influence can operate outside of conscious awareness. The authors draw on the associative network theory of memory to explain their findings. This research improves the theoretical understanding of country- and product-image halo and provides the grounds for product and brand managers to work with government and tourist organizations for increasing mutual effectiveness.

TI Our Apples Are Healthier Than Your Apples: Deciphering the Healthiness
   Bias for Domestic and Foreign Products
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB This study extends previous research by exploring perceptions of healthiness in the international food marketplace. To this end, it aims to fill an important gap by shedding light on the role of country of origin in shaping perceptions of healthiness. The authors provide evidence that domestic and foreign food products elicit different perceptions of healthiness. Consumers choose domestic products because they perceive them as healthier and more natural. The effect holds across different samples and product categories (apples, tomatoes, bread, and yogurt). However, this healthiness bias vanishes when products are presented as posing health risks and when products are introduced with a dual identity (i.e., both foreign and domestic). Researching these health-related effects helps provide a better understanding of consumer attitudes toward domestic- versus foreign-made food products.

TI Does Being Perceived as Global Pay Off? An Analysis of Leading Foreign
   and Domestic Multinational Corporations in India, Japan, and the United
   States
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB As global players, multinational product and corporate brands are known to have an advantage over local competitors. Although foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) increasingly compete against domestic MNCs, particularly in economically strong countries, little is known about (1) whether foreign MNCs can use their globalness to their advantage and (2) how the perceptions of foreign versus domestic MNCs drive consumer behavior. To examine this issue, the authors propose a framework based on accessibility-diagnosticity theory and test it using consumer data from countries in which leading foreign and domestic MNCs compete. The results show that perceived brand globalness enhances consumers' intentional loyalty toward MNCs indirectly by affecting the functional and psychological value these MNCs offer. The value-creation routes change according to firms' origins that is, foreign MNCs translate globalness through functional and psychological value, while domestic MNCs translate globalness through psychological value. However, the benefits of being global and the value-creation routes for foreign (vs. domestic) MNCs differ between countries. Finally, high consumer ethnocentrism weakens but does not completely erase the effects of perceived brand globalness in all countries and interacts with MNCs' origins.

TI Consumer Xenocentrism as Determinant of Foreign Product Preference: A
   System Justification Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Foreign and domestic product purchase behavior largely depends on consumer predispositions. The dominant construct in international marketing literature explaining such behavior has been consumer ethnocentrism, which is conceptually anchored in social identity theory. However, such a perspective overlooks evidence that certain consumers are consistently attracted by the "foreignness" of a product. Drawing from system justification theory, the present investigation conceptualizes and provides an empirical test of the consumer xenocentrism construct that is intended to explain consumer attraction toward foreign products. Using survey data from five complementary studies, the authors develop and validate a new scale (the C-XENSCALE) to measure consumers' xenocentric tendencies and offer extensive evidence on its ability to explain consumer preferences for foreign products. The authors discuss implications of the findings for theory and managerial practice and identify future research directions.

   Multinational: Leveraging Customer Participation for New Product
   Advantage
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Multinational success in building new product advantage through customer participation is contingent on a multinational's ability to understand the moderating influence of cross-national collaboration of its marketing personnel. The findings from a survey of global marketing managers indicate that customer participation as an information source positively influences new product advantage, but this effect is dampened when cross-national collaboration within a multinational is high. However, customer participation as a codeveloper positively influences new product advantage only when the level of cross-national collaboration is high. The contrasting moderating effects of cross -national collaboration have important implications for international marketing theory and practice.

TI Exploitation and Exploration in International Joint Ventures: Moderating
   Effects of Partner Control Imbalance and Product Similarity
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB International joint ventures (IJVs) need to exploit their existing resources as well as explore new capabilities to capture the potential in emerging markets. This study develops a contingent view, arguing that the efficacy of exploitation and exploration depends on the levels of control imbalance and product similarity between an IJV's foreign and local partners. A sample of 198 IJVs in China reveals that partner control imbalance has a U-shaped moderating effect on the relationship between exploitation and IJV new product performance but has an inverted U-shaped moderating effect on the effectiveness of exploration. Exploitation relates more strongly to IJV new product performance when partner product similarity is high, whereas exploration has a stronger impact on IJV new product performance at low levels of partner product similarity. These findings provide novel insights for IJVs to better manage exploitation and exploration in their new product development.

TI Customer Responses to Switching Costs: A Meta-Analytic Investigation of
   the Moderating Influence of Culture
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Relationship marketing effectiveness varies across different markets, but prior research has provided limited evidence on how cultural variations relate to the effects of relationship variables such as switching costs. The authors develop and test a theoretical framework that explains how culture moderates the relationship between perceived switching costs and key consequences. The findings of a meta-analysis, based on 451 effect sizes collected in 25 countries, show that similar components that refer to a match between the value essence of Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the motivators that steer particular consequences explain how individualism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity moderate the impact of switching costs on word of mouth of customers and loyalty types. Furthermore, the economic development of a country explains when switching costs either reduce or increase switching of customers. The findings of this study support international companies in making decisions about the generation of switching costs in particular markets and the formation of international relationship marketing and referral programs.

TI How Product Category Shapes Preferences Toward Global and Local Brands:
   A Schema Theory Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB In contrast to the abundance of research on brand-and consumer-related determinants of global/local brand preference, little is known about whether and how the product category affects consumer choices between local and global brands. Drawing from schema theory, the authors (1) argue that consumers rely on their product category schemata to form perceptions of global versus local brand superiority, (2) introduce a compact scale to measure these perceptions, and (3) identify the key antecedents and consequences of these perceptions. Two studies in developed and emerging markets empirically support the hypotheses across multiple product categories, for both real and fictitious brands. The results indicate that consumers perceive global brands as superior to local brands in product categories with strong functional character and extensive symbolic capacity. Moreover, brands congruent with category superiority perceptions are preferred because of their justifiability, while brands that deviate from these perceptions are avoided because of their proneness to normative criticism. The findings imply that global/local brand preference is largely formed at the product category level and advocate for the use of category-specific strategies in global/local brand management.

TI Doing Good in Another Neighborhood: Attributions of CSR Motives Depend
   on Corporate Nationality and Cultural Orientation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB In the past few decades, consumers around the world have placed increasing value on corporate social responsibility (CSR). As a response, companies entering new markets have boosted spending in areas like cause-related marketing to improve their reputation and create goodwill among consumers in the host country. However, these efforts may not be effective for all consumers or in all countries. Drawing upon research on intergroup bias and attribution theory, the present work explores how consumers from individualistic (the United States and Canada) and collectivistic (South Korea and India) cultures form attributions and attitudes about the CSR activities of foreign and domestic firms. Across three studies, we find that collectivistic (but not individualistic) consumers make more altruistic (but not egoistic) attributions about the CSR motives of domestic (vs. foreign) companies, and that altruistic attribution leads to more positive attitudes toward the firm. We also showed that collectivists' bias against foreign firms is attenuated when level of commitment to the cause (as conveyed by CSR duration) is high.

TI Time, Temporality, and Internationalization: The Relationship Among
   Point in Time of, Time to, and Speed of International Expansion
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Speed of internationalization is a multidimensional concept with performance consequences, but little is known about the interrelatedness between different time-related concepts. The authors address this deficiency by developing three hypotheses, which are confronted with a data set collected on site at 203 small and medium-sized enterprises. The analysis reveals that (1) the longer the time to internationalization, the lower the speed of international expansion; (2) the earlier the point in time when internationalization starts, the lower the speed of international expansion; and (3) there is an antagonistic interaction effect revealing that the negative effect on the speed of international expansion caused by a longer time to internationalization is moderated by the point in time when internationalization starts. The study contributes to theory by examining the interrelatedness between temporal concepts in the internationalization literature and by showing how the underlying mechanisms influencing internationalization speed change over time. For managers, insights into the importance of time and temporality for successful international expansion are provided.

TI Antecedents and Consequences of Infidelity in Cross-Border Business
   Relationships
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The volatile, complex, and distant nature of the international business environment inevitably gives rise to incidences of infidelity among interacting exporters and importers. The authors propose and test a theoretically anchored model of the antecedents and consequences of infidelity in exporter importer working relationships. The findings confirm that importers' infidelity incidences occur more often in cases in which trust, satisfaction, commitment, and cooperation are low in the relationship. Indeed, the association between poor relationship quality and infidelity becomes stronger when the relationship is at a declining stage and is relatively young. The existence of infidelity in the relationship will lead to either punitive actions or reassessment measures on the part of the exporter, which are moderated by the degree of long-term orientation and social bonding that exists between the interacting parties.

TI Intention-Behavior Discrepancy of Foreign Versus Domestic Brands in
   Emerging Markets: The Relevance of Consumer Prior Knowledge
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Most research on the performance of foreign versus domestic brands in emerging markets has examined dependent measures of product evaluation or purchase intention. However, consumers who intend to buy a product may switch to competing brands, thus displaying an intention-behavior discrepancy (IBD). Drawing on literature on country associations and dual process theory, the authors examine the performance of foreign versus domestic brands on IBD in emerging markets and the moderating role of consumer prior knowledge. They conduct an intention survey followed by a postpurchase survey in the Chinese automobile and smartphone industries and find that foreign brands have an advantage on IBD relative to domestic brands, indicating that they have the dual advantage of higher evaluations and lower IBDs. Furthermore, foreign brands' advantage on IBD is smaller for consumers with inaccurate prior knowledge because they are more likely to systematically reprocess information and discount foreign brands' favorable country associations. For these consumers, overestimating the product reduces foreign brands' advantage to a lesser degree than underestimating it as a result of confirmation bias. These findings provide implications for brands in emerging markets.

TI Ritualization: A Strategic Tool to Position Brands in International
   Markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Most brands today attempt to develop a self brand connection with their customers. Multiple studies have proposed that a brand can achieve a sacred status through "rituals." However, there is limited understanding of the mechanism through which rituals and customers' ritualized behavior influence brand awareness. As firms in international markets face intense competition from local brands, understanding the impact of customers' ritualization can help them enhance brand awareness. The authors develop a conceptual framework and provide theoretical understanding on the relationship between rituals and brand awareness for firms operating in international markets. Specifically, they propose that internal ritualization leads to brand recall and external ritualization leads to brand recognition. As customer firm relationship can be affected by market, firm, and customer-specific factors, the authors argue that cultural orientation, competition, firms' marketing spend, and customers' personality moderate the proposed relationships. They provide several research propositions to help understand rituals as a strategic tool. The findings of this study indicate that managers must incorporate customers' ritualized behavior when developing global branding strategies in international markets.

TI The Role of M-Commerce Readiness in Emerging and Developed Markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Although mobile commerce (m-commerce) growth provides ample potential for retailers around the globe, several studies have shown that it has failed to attract potential customers across different countries. This study advances the literature by comparing m-commerce customers' behavioral intentions and actual behaviors using data from 812 m-commerce users across four countries (Australia, India, the United States, and Pakistan). This context offers a unique opportunity for understanding how m-commerce consumers' behaviors differ across disparate national markets. The authors propose a conceptual framework linking m-commerce users' behaviors (intentions and actual usages) to key drivers (ubiquity and habit), and they develop hypotheses about the moderating roles of m-commerce readiness and habit in these linkages. The results reveal important asymmetries between m-commerce readiness stage and between habit: users at an early m-commerce readiness stage assign more importance to ubiquity relative to habit in influencing purchase intentions, whereas the opposite is true for the users who are at an advanced stage. Habit moderates the influence of ubiquity such that its importance in determining intention decreases as the behavior in question takes a more habitual nature. The authors outline how m-retailers operating across developed and developing countries should adapt their marketing strategies to customers at different m-commerce readiness stages.

TI I Use It But Will Tell You That I Don't: Consumers' Country-of-Origin
   Cue Usage Denial
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Despite extensive evidence that a brand's country-of-origin (COO) affects consumers' brand evaluations and behavioral intentions, consumers are often reluctant to admit this influence. Challenging the proclaimed irrelevance of the COO concept, the present study assesses the phenomenon of COO cue usage denial, an unconscious defense mechanism that consumers apply to maintain an acceptable self-image. Drawing on self-affirmation theory and based on two experimental studies (combined N = 462), the authors demonstrate that a substantial proportion of consumers are influenced by the COO cue when assessing brands, despite claims to the contrary. Such consumers not only differ from consumers who do not know a brand's COO but also modify their brand assessments and behavioral intentions when exposed to a COO change. This study also develops a consumer typology based on both the stated (self-reported) and actual influence of a brand's COO, thus highlighting the importance of segmenting consumers according to their susceptibility to COO influences. The authors discuss several theoretical and managerial implications and identify directions for further research.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Relational governance and control mechanisms are important means of managing interfirm relationships. Yet, the effectiveness of different governance mechanisms remains equivocal, especially in the international context. In this study, the authors investigate the value of relational and control governance across relationship length. Using a survey of 217 export ventures from China, they find that relational governance is not effective for short-term relationships but that it becomes effective in the long run. Output control improves export performance across short- and long-term relationships, whereas process control has its limits and weakens export performance for short-term relationships. In addition, the findings show that relational governance positively moderates the effects of output and process control on export performance for long-term relationships.

   Culture in Online Word-of-Mouth Reviews
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Consumer- and producer-generated content on the Internet has become an important source of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) for buyers making purchasing decisions. However, the cultural effect of eWOM on firm performance remains largely unexplored. This research contributes to the extant marketing literature by examining the moderating role of culture in the relationship between eWOM and product-market performance. The author finds that individualism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance tempered the effect of eWOM on market share. In particular, the impact of press releases and negative reviews has been overrated. The findings suggest that effective online international marketing strategies should take into account local market values, country-of-origin effects, and product competition.

TI A Dynamic Process of Building Global Supply Chain Competence by New
   Ventures: The Case of Uniqlo
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB In today's volatile global marketplace, firms should pursue flexible asset distribution and high-quality, low-cost manufacturing operations simultaneously. Previous studies have examined the relationships between supplier management related variables and market performance with cross-sectional data; however, little guidance is available for newly internationalizing ventures aiming to build a global supply chain network from scratch. To shed light on this dynamic process, we examine Uniqlo's successful supply chain development in China, using longitudinal contextual data. Our findings show that Uniqlo went through discrete dynamic stages in its supply chain development efforts. First, Uniqlo, initially a small firm, developed relational governance with its suppliers by exercising dynamic economic power concentration over time. Second, it began to provide technical support to help its suppliers build competence with the aim of increasing their cooperation. Third, Uniqlo enforced compulsory nonexclusivity arrangements with suppliers to achieve supplier flexibility by not just having Uniqlo as primary customer. This provides relational flexibility through both relational governance and partner flexibility for the principal firm in the global supply chain development.

TI Differential Effects of Bilateral Norms on SMEs' Export Relationships: A
   Dynamic Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Prior research has established the pivotal role of bilateral norms in relationship marketing, identifying them as effective relational governance mechanisms that firms can use to manage their international alliances with overseas intermediaries. Unfortunately, few studies have examined differential effects of specific norms on positive and negative behaviors, let alone norms' effectiveness in the harsh export context of resource -constrained small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To address these gaps, the authors explicate the effects of three norms (continuity expectations, equity, and cooperation) on both dysfunctional and productive behaviors of foreign distributors. Using two consecutive data collections, the results indicate that norms curb importer opportunism and help improve importer role performance and that continuity expectations and cooperation increase the chances of the survival of export ventures. The study further scrutinizes relational norms' effects on opportunism in the context of exporting SMEs' realities and tests relevant moderating effects. The findings indicate that while exporter dependence reduces the shielding effect of norms against opportunism, psychic distance and competitive intensity strengthen the protecting effect of relational norms. The results of this study underscore the heterogeneous nature of relational norms and suggest that norms such as continuity expectations play a leading role in structuring the ideology of a business dyad.

TI Old Country Passions: An International Examination of Country Image,
   Animosity, and Affinity Among Ethnic Consumers
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Ethnic consumers are an important market segment in both traditionally multicultural countries and newer destinations of growing immigration waves. Such consumers may carry with them "old country passions" that may influence their attitudes toward the products of countries perceived as friendly or hostile in relation to the consumers' original home countries. This study is the first to examine together four place-related constructs namely, country and people images, product images, affinity, and animosity and their potential effects on purchase intentions for products from countries that may be perceived as friends or foes from the perspective of the ethnic consumers' homeland, while also juxtaposing these measures against views toward a neutral "benchmark" country for comparison. The results show that country/ people and product images, affinity, and animosity work differently depending on the target country; both affective and cognitive factors influence product and people evaluations; and attitudes vary in their predictive ability on purchase intentions. The article concludes with a discussion implications from the findings and directions for further research.

TI The Tenure-Based Customer Retention Model: A Cross-Cultural Validation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB International businesses and their marketing managers face complexity in the targeting of different customer groups in multiple countries, with different purchase histories and brand relationship tenures. Thus far, no customer retention model has been suggested to sufficiently reduce such complexity. To fill the gap, this study distinguishes three global customer groups brand stayers, brand switchers, and category novices which are differently prevalent in countries of various economic development. In particular, category novices have been a largely neglected segment for emerging markets. The study introduces the tenure-based customer retention model, which proposes the idiosyncratic effects of each group on the basis of tenure-based and attitudinal repurchase drivers. A large-scale consumer study (N = 53,744; 30 countries) cross-culturally validates the suggested model and reflects country-specific factors based on cultural dimensions instead of economic development. The findings broadly support the standardization of international marketing over different countries but not across different buyer segments. Consequently, the study offers insights into the communicative measures that can be used to globally address repurchase intent for each segment.

TI International Market Entry: How Do Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises
   Make Decisions?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Choosing the right international market entry mode is of utmost importance for an internationalizing firm. However, there is a lack of analysis concerning the decision-making process (DMP), specifically with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors study the DMP among SMEs intent on entering international markets and how it affects each firm's international market development strategy. Using six cases based in Finland and Italy, the authors develop a model of the SME DMP. Their results imply that the DMP evolves and goes through various phases. By focusing on the postentry phase, this study enhances knowledge on decision-making frameworks by linking the traditional international marketing literature related to initial entry mode with "mainstream" international business literature. Furthermore, the study reveals that SMEs adopting a more rational DMP are more likely to succeed in foreign markets, and consequently, it demonstrates the importance of real options reasoning as a theoretical lens for making entry mode decisions in the context of SMEs.

TI A Contingent View of Partner Coopetition in International Joint Ventures
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Is coopetition between foreign and local partners good or bad for international joint venture (IJV) performance? This study develops a contingent view to examine how the efficacy of coopetition is conditional on IJV characteristics (i.e., foreign equity share and partner cultural compatibility) and environmental factors (i.e., technological turbulence and market growth). The results from analyzing 194 IJVs in China reveal that coopetition fosters IJV performance under the conditions of high foreign equity share, low partner cultural compatibility, high technological turbulence, and/or high market growth. In contrast, coopetition hinders IJV performance at low levels of foreign equity share, technological turbulence, and/or market growth, or at high levels of partner cultural compatibility. These findings support the authors' contingent view of coopetition and provide novel insights for managing partner coopetition in IJVs.

TI Eastern Versus Western Culture Pricing Strategy: Superstition, Lucky
   Numbers, and Localization
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Eastern versus Western culture pricing practices differ with respect to price endings; however, Eastern cultures are increasingly influenced by Western multinational corporations. At the same time, increasing antiglobalization sentiment suggests the use of localization strategies in these markets. The authors investigate whether pricing practices still differ in this new environment, examine the role of superstition, and ask whether Western brands can benefit from localizing pricing practices. They explore the use of lucky number price endings and consumer responses to such pricing strategies in Singapore, an Eastern culture that is strongly exposed to Western multinational influence. Using a content analysis of newspaper advertisements and two experiments, the authors find that superstitious pricing practices continue, especially with high-priced items and brands of Eastern (vs. Western) origin. In the experimental studies, they find that superstitious pricing has a positive effect on price attractiveness and that foreign brands that localize their prices benefit from a more positive brand attitude.

TI A Review of Global Competitiveness Research: Past Advances and Future
   Directions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The global competitiveness (GC) literature has proven to be a developing, yet critical element in international marketing research. Broadly, GC studies have become a part of the marketing, international business, and strategic management fields. In light of this far-reaching topic and to gain a unique understanding of the dynamics across the GC domain, this study examines the intellectual structure of GC research at two distinct levels of analysis: overall GC publications and marketing and international business GC articles. This review of the literature uses cocitation data to provide insight to the field and develop a research-based model for future consideration. A total of 48 journals are included, providing 1,819 articles with 115,462 citations for examination. Applying multidimensional scaling to analyze the data, the study introduces a GC-focused model and provides possible topics for research. The proposed organizing framework includes elements of a market-based perspective (offering development, market orientation, and process emphasis), strategy implementation (firm-related advantages, strategic approach, and international focus), and performance to advance the critical nature of the marketing function in the GC literature.

TI Which Competitive Advantage(s)? Competitive Advantage-Market Performance
   Relationships in International Markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Business scholars and managers stress the importance of achieving and sustaining competitive advantage as a critical strategic step in enabling superior firm performance. Yet which types of competitive advantage may yield the best performance outcomes-and what contingency factorsmay affect this-remains largely unexplored. This article examines the contribution of price, product, and service advantages to market performance in international ventures. Applying customer value logic to the literature on value creation and value capture, the authors posit that the symmetric achievement of all pairs of advantages leads to increased market performance. The findings confirm this conjecture, while for the product-service advantage pairing, even asymmetry in achievement has a positivemarket performance effect when the asymmetry is toward service. Using primary data from a sample of U.K. manufacturing exporters, the authors find that price advantage has a direct positive effect on market performance, while the strong positive effect of service advantage is further strengthened (and the nonsignificant effect of product advantage becomes negative) when the distributor has high-quality relationships with the overseas customers and there is available production capacity, even in technologically turbulent environments.

The results, based on data from the motion picture industry, demonstrate that brand equity, financial resources, and competitive intensity result in shorter global product rollout and that shorter global product rollout enhances global product performance. They also find that brand equity and financial resources operate as moderators, magnifying the effect of length of global product rollout on global product performance. Implications for international marketing academics and practitioners are presented.

TI Export Performance: A Focus on Discretionary Adaptation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Marketing adaptation strategy has been characterized as a strategic imperative in markets with protectionist and nationalist sentiments, which underscores the need to better understand the effects of adaptation strategy. However, empirical investigations of international marketing strategy have considered mandatory and discretionary adaptations as equivalent. Discretionary adaptations, unlike mandatory adaptations, involve choice; thus, they are more relevant to the selection of an international marketing strategy. This article focuses on the direct and conditional effects of discretionary adaptation on export performance. Analyzing data from 203 U.S. small and medium-sized enterprises, the authors find a positive effect of discretionary adaptation on export performance as well as moderating effects of (1) a market characteristic (psychic distance), (2) a firm characteristic (international experience), and (3) a product characteristic (product positional advantage). The implications suggest that adaptation strategy may be more advantageous than previously thought, and that researchers should focus on discretionary adaptations when investigating the choice of a relatively standardized versus adapted international marketing strategy.

TI Who Buys Counterfeit Luxury Brands? A Meta-Analytic Synthesis of
   Consumers in Developing and Developed Markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Although numerous previous studies have investigated consumer demographics and psychographics as determinants of counterfeit purchases, their findings are diverse and fragmented. In conceptually referring to the brand signals that help consumers build their identities, the present meta-analysis synthesizes the influence of consumer demographics and psychographics on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors with regard to branded counterfeit luxury products. It empirically summarizes 610 effect sizes from 98 independent studies and shows that whereas demographics have little impact, some psychographics greatly influence counterfeit purchases, with these influences differing between developed and developing countries. In the former, risk propensity and reduced integrity are stronger determinants of counterfeit purchases and are related to brand signals that refer to identities that consumers attempt to avoid. In developing countries, consumers are more influenced by psychographics, such as status seeking, which are related to positive brand signals for consumer identities. The findings lead to a profile of consumers of counterfeit luxury items that provides guidance for future research and for improved consumer targeting with regard to international anticounterfeiting measures.

This article investigates the effect of these new technologies and the changing global business environment to understand how relational approaches to international market entry (IME) are changing in light of macro developments. Despite substantial resources in business practice dedicated to combining relational strategies in digital settings, this analysis of extant literature reveals that fewer than 3% of peer-reviewed research articles in the international marketing domain examine digital contexts. To address this gap, the authors assess 25 years of literature to provide (1) a description of the evolution of IME research; (2) a review and synthesis of pertinent literature that adopts relational, digital, and hybrid approaches to IME; (3) a taxonomy of IME strategies; and (4) directions for further research.

TI Global Customer Engagement
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Advances in technology and analytics have stimulated competition in the global marketplace and augmented interactions among customers globally. It is therefore imperative for firms to understand the behavioral activities of customers around the world to keep them engaged. To do so, the authors recommend that managers familiarize themselves with countries' cultural and economic factors. The authors use Hofstede's cultural dimensions and country-level economic factors to explain the national differences in customer motives while engaging with the firm. This study explains that national cultural dimensions exert an effect on the relationships in the customer engagement (CE) framework proposed by Pansari and Kumar (2017). The authors discuss and develop research propositions on the impact of the relevant cultural and economic dimensions that affect the various proposed relationships in the original CE framework. Through this modified CE framework, they introduce the concept of global customer engagement to help firms design marketing strategies aligned with a country's culture and economy to obtain improved CE and enhanced firm performance.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB There has been a significant increase in scholarly research focusing on marketing capabilities as an important aspect of marketing theory-based explanations of firm performance. This growing research interest in marketing capabilities has also been reflected in the international marketing literature. However, it is unclear whether and how thinking and research about international marketing capabilities differs from that of marketing capabilities in a domestic market context. To explore this question, the authors conduct a review of studies of marketing capabilities in the most influential journals publishing research in international marketing. They supplement this with insights from interviews with executives in firms engaged to varying degrees in international marketing. The study suggests that there remain numerous important unanswered questions in conceptualizing and empirically researching international marketing capabilities.

TI An Assessment of the Exporting Literature: Using Theory and Data to
   Identify Future Research Directions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Exporting research is an established facet of the field of international marketing. That stated, the radical increase in recent export activity necessitates a sustained research effort devoted to the topic. In this article, the authors provide a qualitative review of the core theoretical exporting areas and evaluate the exporting domain quantitatively over six decades (1958-2016). For the quantitative analysis, they use multidimensional scaling and apply established bibliometric principles to offer an understanding of the field and to provide suggestions for future exporting research. For the evaluations, the authors used data from 830 articles with 52,191 citations from 35 journals. Using cocitation analysis as the basis to evaluate the data, they propose a series of intellectual structure implications on exporting that relate to internationalization process stages, dynamic capabilities, knowledge scarcity, social networks, export marketing strategy, absorptive capacity and learning, and nonlinear performance relationships involving marketing channel relationships.

TI Toward a Yin-Yang Balancing Perspective of Relational (Guanxi)
   Gatekeeping in International Exchange Relationships in China
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB China is an extremely complex and "insider-controlled" market for foreign businesses. This study offers a yin-yang balancing perspective of international exchange relationships in China. The authors investigate how "relational gatekeepers" play a key role in achieving a dynamic balance between Western companies and local partners in international exchange relationships. In-depth interviews are conducted with 41 business managers based in China, Australia, and New Zealand. Guided by the yin-yang balancing frame, the authors develop four key constructs of relational gatekeeping: the gatekeeper resources of mianzi (insider status) and renqing (insider favor) and the gatekeeper capabilities of zao shi (creating favorable momentum) and ying shi (leveraging favorable momentum). The yin-yang frame provides a process view of business relationships that accepts paradoxical conditions and embraces dynamic network momentum, resources, and capabilities. The study concludes by showing the theoretical implications for network theory and for the field of dynamic balancing and suggests the managerial implications for an international company aiming to engage relational gatekeepers to break into insider (guanxi)-controlled local business networks.

TI Culturally Contingent Electronic Word-of-Mouth Signaling and Screening:
   A Comparative Study of Product Reviews in the United States and Japan
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) is an important source of influence on consumer decision making, yet little is known about cross-cultural differences in both the occurrence of eWOM and the relationship between eWOM and sales. The authors draw on signaling theory to develop a conceptual model and assess the relationships between country and the occurrence of eWOM, as well as between online ratings and relative product sales according to country. Online reviews and sales rank data for books, CDs, and DVDs were collected from Amazon U.S. and Amazon Japan in 2009 and 2017. Results suggest cross-national differences in both the occurrence of eWOM (eWOM signaling) and the relationship between eWOM and relative product sales (eWOM screening). These national differences appear to change over time: some remain stable, some disappear, and others emerge. The proposed culturally contingent signaling and screening model may be adopted as a framework for future research on cross-cultural eWOM. The results also inform the literature on cultural change by suggesting that cultural differences in eWOM change in nuanced patterns over time.

TI "Should Have I Bought the Other One?" Experiencing Regret in Global
   Versus Local Brand Purchase Decisions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB This research addresses the unexplored postpurchase dynamics of global/local brand choices by investigating the experience of regret in global versus local brand purchases. Drawing on regret theory, the authors demonstrate in four complementary studies that the global/local availability of both chosen and forgone brands influences consumer responses to regrettable purchases and that the direction and magnitude of this influence depend on the consumers' product category schema and global identity. Study 1 shows that regrettable decisions to forgo global for local brands elicit stronger regret, lower satisfaction, and higher brand switching than regrettable purchases of global (vs. local) brands for consumers with a global brand superiority schema for the category; the inverse holds for consumers with a local brand superiority schema. Studies 2 and 3 replicate the effect and show that it is mediated by perceived decision justifiability and moderated by global identity. Study 4 further validates the observed effect using a real brand choice task in a category with a local brand-dominated schema. The findings reveal the postpurchase consequences of global/local brand choices and provide concrete advice for global/local branding strategies.

TI Behavioral Implications of International Social Media Advertising: An
   Investigation of Intervening and Contingency Factors
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Despite the rapid growth of social media and the enthusiasm surrounding social media advertising (SMA), scant theoretical and empirical knowledge exists on the cross-border effectiveness of SMA and its influence on consumer behavior in the social media environment. This research develops a four-stage belief-value-attitude-behavior framework to understand the intervening role of SMA value and attitude and reflect how consumers react to SMA across cultures and global social media types. The results confirm the mediating effects of value and attitude and reveal that positive attitude toward SMA increases social media-specific behaviors (i.e., message and social interaction behaviors). The moderating effect results of culture reveal a greater impact of infotainment on SMA value and of credibility on SMA value and attitude in the higher-uncertainty-avoidance culture. Infotainment has a larger effect on SMA value and attitude in global content community sites than in global social networking sites, but there is a reverse moderating effect on the impact of credibility. The research provides a better theoretical understanding of consumers' behavioral responses to SMA in international marketplaces.

TI Understanding Earliness of Internationalization and Its Impact on
   Postentry Geographic Diversity of International Young Ventures
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Early and rapid internationalization has emerged as an established phenomenon of research, yet several fundamental issues remain to be studied. In this research, the authors aim to analyze the link between earliness of internationalization-a temporal dimension of foreign market entry-and the geographic diversity of international expansion, as well as the contingent nature of the relationship. They test their hypotheses with empirical data collected in a survey among international young ventures in China. The results show that while earliness of internationalization does not directly lead to the geographic diversity of a venture's international expansion, its impact becomes salient as the venture gains international legitimacy and strategic flexibility. Furthermore, the moderating effects of international legitimacy and strategic flexibility vary according to the type of the venture's first foreign market (regional vs. global). This research advances the knowledge not only of the important role of early foreign market entry but also of the strategic factors for paths created by accelerated internationalization. It potentially contributes to the emergent research on foreign market entry timing/speed of internationalization and performance implications of international young ventures.

TI Social Media Ties Strategy in International Branding: An Application of
   Resource-Based Theory
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Despite the prominence of social media (SM) in global branding, no prior studies have evaluated an international brand's strategy of establishing market-based relational ties with SM users in local markets. This study draws from the resource-based theory to conceptualize SM ties as latent relational resources and evaluate an international brand's SM ties strategy on the basis of three resource attributes: value, inimitability, and rarity. Whereas value is the initial basis for a relational resource in SM, inimitability and rarity are the foci of an international brand's strategy in local SM networks. The authors interviewed brand managers and SM users in China and New Zealand and conducted direct observations on brands' SM sites. They develop two theoretical frameworks (one initial; one advanced) to offer insights into the development of brand-user ties as a relational resource in the context of an international brand's global or foreign consumer culture positioning in a host-country market. The authors conclude that combined incentives offered in SM must be tailored to the type of brand-user tie.

TI Opportunity Discovery and Creation as a Duality: Evidence from Small
   Firms' Foreign Market Entries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Little research addresses the likely enabling character of the discovery and creation of opportunities during the internationalization of small firms or how international opportunities are found and constructed during the process of foreign market entry (FME). This article therefore studies how opportunities become connected during small firms' FME. By incorporating the concept of duality, this article conceives of the discovery and creation of opportunity as mutually enabling rather than opposed. From this duality perspective, opportunity discovery and creation facilitate each other during internationalization processes. This case study involves five high-tech Australian firms and 30 FMEs. The findings show that knowledge, networks, and capabilities enable opportunities in the FME context. International opportunities are connected and nested in different levels of generality and specificity. The FME opportunities may be based on opportunity embeddedness, because each opportunity has implications for other opportunities. The findings lead to a model and propositions to explain the relationships between opportunity discovery and creation in FME.

TI Addressing Endogeneity in International Marketing Applications of
   Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has become a key method in international marketing research. Users of PLS-SEM have, however, largely overlooked the issue of endogeneity, which has become an integral component of regression analysis applications. This lack of attention is surprising because the PLS-SEM method is grounded in regression analysis, for which numerous approaches for handling endogeneity have been proposed. To identify and treat endogeneity, and create awareness of how to deal with this issue, this study introduces a systematic procedure that translates control variables, instrumental variables, and Gaussian copulas into a PLS-SEM framework. We illustrate the procedure's efficacy by means of empirical data and offer recommendations to guide international marketing researchers on how to effectively address endogeneity concerns in their PLS-SEM analyses.

TI Differential Effects of Customers' Regulatory Fit on Trust, Perceived
   Value, and M-Commerce Use among Developing and Developed Countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Despite promising growth, mobile commerce (m-commerce) still represents only a small proportion of the world's total e-commerce market. The research behind this article moves away from the predominantly single-country (typically developed) and utilitarian-focused market scope of past research to examine and provide a more nuanced understanding of customers' motivations, whether utilitarian or hedonic, for using m-commerce across six countries. The six-country context, with data collected from 1,183 m-commerce users, offers a unique opportunity to advance mobile-retailing literature by comparing customers' value perceptions, trust, and m-commerce use across disparate national markets. By treating motivations as conditions activated by individuals' chronic regulatory orientations, our results show that hedonic motivation plays a more significant role in influencing customers' value perceptions and trust for those who are promotion oriented (Australia and the United States), whereas utilitarian motivation plays a more important role for those who are prevention oriented (Bangladesh and Vietnam). Finally, both hedonic and utilitarian motivations play an important role in influencing customers' value perceptions and trust for those who are moderately promotion and prevention oriented (India and Pakistan). These results offer insights to mobile retailers operating internationally in their decisions to standardize or adapt the mobile-shopping environment to deliver the most valuable, trustworthy, and engaging solutions to customers.

TI Middle-Class Consumers in Emerging Markets: Conceptualization,
   Propositions, and Implications for International Marketers
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB As emerging markets gain significance in the global economy, understanding the middle-class customers within these dynamic economies becomes even more critical for international marketers. This article contributes to the limited but growing literature on this topic. International marketing scholars and practitioners should be better informed about this megatrend. What does the "middle class" really mean? What are the theoretical underpinnings for the middle-class phenomenon? What are the implications for international marketing? To address these pressing questions, the authors explore the middle-class phenomenon in emerging markets. Through an examination of conceptual underpinnings and empirical observations, they present a conceptualization and several theoretical propositions. Finally, they provide managerial and scholarly implications of the middle-class phenomenon and offer suggestions for further research.

TI How Can International Ventures Utilize Marketing Capability in Emerging
   Markets? Its Contingent Effect on New Product Development
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Whether international ventures can benefit from their marketing capability in emerging markets is a critical but underresearched issue. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), the authors propose that marketing capability can enhance international ventures' new product performance. However, its effect is contingent on environmental forces (i.e., market uncertainty and technological turbulence) in the highly uncertain and turbulent environments of emerging markets. Using survey data of international ventures in high-tech industries in China, the authors find that marketing capability is less effective for new product development when firms face high levels of market uncertainty or technological turbulence. At that time, enhancing knowledge breadth represents a critical strategic solution to address the decreased efficacy of marketing capability in driving innovation.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB There is no intensive review available of research at the interface of international marketing and entrepreneurship. This article systematically logs and organizes the subject matter and provides research suggestions. An organizing framework with three main dimensions-international marketing, the nature of marketing, and entrepreneurship-guides the literature review, which relies on a full search of articles relevant to international marketing and entrepreneurship published in academic journals over the past two decades (1997-2016). The study adopts a qualitative research approach to analyze 169 articles that meet the definitions of both international marketing and entrepreneurship research. Nine research types emerge at the intersection of international marketing and entrepreneurship research, and the study examines the theoretical and empirical trends of each type. A promising avenue for future studies would be cross-cultural comparative research on the individual-opportunity nexus in marketing across countries. More mixed-method and longitudinal research designs are also welcomed. The authors conclude by offering suggestions for future interdisciplinary research.

TI A Cross-National Study of Evolutionary Origins of Gender Shopping
   Styles: She Gatherer, He Hunter?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB By investigating gendered shopping styles across countries, the authors explore whether the differences between male and female shopping styles are greater than the differences in shopping styles exhibited by consumers across countries. With a conceptual model, this study tests an extant convergence hypothesis that predicts that men and women should grow more similar in their shopping styles as traditional gender-based divisions in wage and domestic labor disappear. The results of a survey of shopping behavior across I I countries indicate though that men and women are evolutionarily predisposed to different shopping styles. These differences in shopping styles also are greater in countries with higher levels of gender equality. Empathizing, or the ability to tune in to others' thoughts and feelings, mediates shopping styles more for women; systemizing, or the degree to which a person possesses spatial skills, mediates shopping styles more for men. These results suggest that gender-based retail segmentation is more strategically relevant than country-based segmentation. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for international marketing theory and practice.

TI Impact of Culture on the Pursuit of Beauty: Evidence from Five Countries
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Human beings have always coveted beautiful objects, but the desire to look good is reaching new heights worldwide. Although the pursuit of beauty appears universal, industry evidence suggests that it is particularly strong in Asia. This research examines the effect of culture on the pursuit of beauty. Three studies provide converging evidence that interdependent self-construal increases the likelihood of using appearance-enhancing products. Study 1 operationalizes culture through nationality and self-construal and shows that Easterners (more interdependent) are more likely to use appearance-enhancing products than Westerners (less interdependent). This use is driven by interdependents' tendency to conform to societal norms, which in turn leads to heightened self-discrepancy (Study 2). The use of appearance-enhancing tools helps minimize this discrepancy. Study 3 shows that strength of norms moderates the impact of interdependence on the use of appearance-enhancing tools. When norms are loosely defined and adherence is not strictly enforced, interdependents' appearance enhancement tendency is reduced. This research offers actionable insights into the pursuit of beauty, marketing of beauty brands, policy making, and consumer well-being.

TI How Shopping Mall Service Quality Affects Customer Loyalty Across
   Developing Countries: The Moderation of the Cultural Context
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Cross-cultural studies indicate the importance of service quality and loyalty in different nations, but they do not specify how cultural context affects the relationships between such constructs. The current research investigates whether mall service quality and its specific dimensions affect loyalty, as well as how cultural contexts moderate the relationships between these constructs in three developing countries (Morocco, Senegal, and Tunisia). With a sample of 750 real customers, the authors show that mall service quality and its specific dimensions affect customer loyalty through the positive mediation of customer satisfaction and mall perceived value. Depending on the country, service quality dimensions (mall physical aspects, reliability, problem solving, and personnel attention) have distinct effects on customer loyalty. Furthermore, mall service quality drives customer loyalty positively in Morocco and Senegal. Customer satisfaction has a positive effect on customer loyalty in Senegal and Tunisia. Due to their different cultural contexts, these three developing countries do not exhibit a homogeneous pattern.

AB The last few decades have seen the emergence of global consumer culture (GCC) as an important force in the marketplace. Yet, in recent years, powerful political and economic forces suggest that globalization might be stalling, leading to renewed interest in local consumer culture (LCC). This article provides an overview of where the field of international marketing stands on GCC and LCC, and it presents new empirical insights. It elaborates on the roots of GCC and LCC in consumer culture theory, cultural globalization theory, and acculturation theory. This background information sets the context for an in-depth discussion of how international marketers have operationalized consumer attitudes toward GCC and LCC, and their individual-level and national-cultural correlates. The article addresses behavioral and managerial consequences of GCC and LCC and concludes with areas for future research.

TI International Marketing Strategy in Emerging-Market Exporting Firms
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Unlike their counterparts in developed markets, emerging-market firms are characterized by limited resources, including international experience and access to relevant information, which are essential for developing suitable international marketing strategy (IMS). Under such circumstances, strategies are expected to produce suboptimal results, especially when targeting competitive markets in advanced economies. Prior IMS research has largely focused on developed markets. In contrast, the authors examine IMS of exporters in Thailand, an emerging market. Despite major differences in environments and processes in emerging markets, they establish that Thai exporters that match their IMS to local market conditions realize superior performance, as predicated by strategy coalignment. The authors validate these results and discuss emerging-market firms' capacity to adapt their strategies and succeed in highly competitive advanced economies, despite relative inexperience, volatility, and information asymmetry at home. Exporting remains of critical importance to the economies of emerging markets, and the findings provide greater optimism for their firms' ability to address host-market conditions in their marketing strategies, as well as pointing to the competitive threat posed by these emerging-market neophytes.

TI Spatial Distance Construal Perspectives on Cause-Related Marketing: The
   Importance of Nationalism in Russia
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Consumers around the globe expect firms to contribute to environmentally and socially responsible causes. Using construal level theory with a spatial distance lens, we examine effects of spatial proximity of the firm (domestic firm vs. foreign multinational corporation [MNC]), cause (domestic vs. global), and consumer cultural identity (locally oriented: nationalism and consumer ethnocentrism; distantly oriented: global identity and global citizenship through global brands) on consumer attitudes toward the firm. Across three studies with a focus on Russia and environmental causes, we consistently find that nationalism moderates consumer attitudes, whereas consumer ethnocentrism, global identity, and global citizenship through global brands do not. When firms engage in cause-related marketing and focus on proximal causes, nationalistic consumers are more favorable toward domestic firms (vs. foreign MNCs). When firms are not engaged in cause-related marketing, consumers with stronger nationalism are more favorable toward domestic firms, and consumers with weaker nationalism are more favorable toward foreign MNCs. Importantly, the effects of nationalism are mitigated when foreign MNCs and domestic firms engage with global causes. Product involvement, environmental concerns, and marketplace skepticism are predictors of attitudes toward the firm. The results highlight the importance of considering the socio-historical-political context of a given country and locally oriented nationalistic beliefs.

TI Consumer Responses to High Service Attentiveness: A Cross-Cultural
   Examination
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Although the literature generally indicates that service attentiveness can increase consumer satisfaction, providing extra care and attention in service encounters may backfire and lead to negative consumer outcomes. In addition, because of cross-cultural differences, the effects of high service attentiveness may vary across international markets. The authors conduct a qualitative study, a field experiment, and two laboratory experiments in three countries (Canada, the United States, and China) across various service contexts (hairdressing, telecommunications, and computer repair) to examine cross-cultural consumer responses toward high service attentiveness. Consumers' negative responses toward high service attentiveness are mediated by their suspicion of ulterior motive, which varies according to their self-construal. Specifically, consumers with an interdependent self-construal (either chronic or primed) tend to have greater suspicion of and negative responses toward high service attentiveness. Furthermore, the effect of interdependent self-construal fostering greater suspicion is attributed to a sharper in-group (vs. out-group) distinction, which is mitigated when the service employee is perceived to be an in-group member. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and managerial implications and suggesting future research directions.

TI Organizing and Implementing Export Pricing: Performance Effects and
   Moderating Factors
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Relatively little is known about pricing in the export business, particularly how to organize and implement export pricing within firms and how these issues affect export performance. Therefore, this study investigates antecedents of export performance, specifically the organizational aspects of export pricing and price adaptation and the moderating role of export market characteristics, including export market turbulence, enforcement of contracts, and corruption ranks of the export market. Using a large-scale survey sample of 295 exporting firms in Austria and Germany and secondary data on the export markets involved, the authors show that both the intensity of internal pricing coordination and price adaptation have a positive effect on export performance. Specifically, in highly turbulent export markets, the intensity of internal pricing coordination contributes to export performance. Furthermore, a high level of horizontal dispersion of pricing authority is advisable in countries in which the enforcement of contracts is difficult.

TI Understanding Cultural Differences in Consumers' Reactions to
   Foreign-Market Brand Extensions: The Role of Thinking Styles
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB One popular strategy for brands to grow outside of their home markets is to use line extensions. Although extensive research has examined how factors such as culture influence product acceptance across markets, far less is known regarding how such factors influence parent brand perceptions in response to an extension. This article investigates the role of one aspect of culture, consumers' thinking styles, in terms of postextension parent brand spillover effects, and considers potential implications for firms' global brand strategies, including the extension's direction (upward or downward) and parent brand concept (functional or prestige). Through two studies, one using consumer panels in the United States and India and the other set in the United States, the authors examine consumer-level differences by measuring thinking styles. Results based on both studies indicate that vertical line extension type affects analytic thinkers' reactions more than those of holistic thinkers, and parent brand image benefits (suffers) when a vertical line extension is for a functional (prestige) brand, regardless of consumers' thinking style. The authors find interesting differences in the role of thinking styles based on the particular dimension examined.

TI The Balancing of Country-Based Interaction Orientation and Marketing
   Strategy Implementation Adaptation/Standardization for Profit Growth in
   Multinational Corporations
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB For business success and continued growth, multinational corporations (MNCs) must work to efficiently leverage interactions with customers dispersed across geographic boundaries. Under the framework of the attention-based view, this study examines the MNC strategic approach of country-based interaction orientation and marketing strategy implementation adaptation/standardization as drivers of global profit growth, contingent on the environmental conditions of competitive intensity and market dynamism. The findings from a survey of U.S.-based MNCs indicate that managerial attention focused on country-based interaction orientation and marketing strategy implementation standardization, when considered jointly, have a positive effect on MNC profit growth. The findings also show that the effect of a country-based interaction orientation on MNC profit growth is not as susceptible to competitive intensity and market dynamism when MNCs standardize their marketing strategy implementation, but it varies when MNCs take a more adapted approach to their implementation strategies across country markets. These findings bring to light important implications for international marketing theory and practice.

TI Favoritism Toward Foreign and Domestic Brands: A Comparison of Different
   Theoretical Explanations
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Five theoretical approaches can predict favoritism toward domestic and foreign brands. This article applies a contrastive perspective to examine social identity, personal identity, cultural identity, system justification, and categorical cognition theories and their attendant constructs. The authors propose a set of main-effects hypotheses as well as hypotheses related to both product and country moderation effects on attitudes toward and loyalty to domestic and foreign brands. They test the hypotheses on a sample of Chinese consumers with respect to salient brands from 12 product categories. The results indicate that three of the theoretical approaches examined can explain only one side of favoritism-most commonly favoritism toward domestic brands-but not favoritism toward both domestic and foreign brands. Consumer xenocentrism, a concept rooted in system justification theory, seems to provide more consistent predictions for both domestic- and foreign-brand bias.

TI Building Customer Loyalty in Intercultural Service Encounters: The Role
   of Service Employees' Cultural Intelligence
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Intercultural service encounters, in which customers and service employees from different cultures interact, are becoming more common in the market. Despite the importance of such encounters for international marketers, limited research attention has been directed to this area. Drawing on social exchange theory, this study examines how frontline employees' cultural intelligence (CQ) influences customer loyalty outcomes of service quality perceptions. Specifically, the authors propose that the three components of CQ-cognitive, emotional/motivational, and physical-have differential moderating effects on the perceived service quality (PSQ)-customer loyalty link and that these effects vary across two national markets. Data collected with a multirespondent (i.e., frontline service employees and customers) cross-cultural research design indicate that cognitive CQ negatively mitigates the impact of PSQ on customer loyalty in an emerging-market context while emotional/motivational CQ has a positive moderating effect in a mature-market setting. When service employees have high physical CQ, the positive role of PSQ in creating and maintaining customer loyalty is strengthened in both markets. The authors discuss these implications for theory and practice.

TI Personality Traits, Consumer Animosity, and Foreign Product Avoidance:
   The Moderating Role of Individual Cultural Characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Although personality and cultural traits were found to be important predictors or moderators of consumer attitudes and behavior, their relationship to consumer animosity has not yet been studied. This article reports the findings of a study conducted with 606 Ukrainian consumers, which aims to identify personality drivers and behavioral outcomes of consumer animosity as well as the moderating role of cultural characteristics. Structural equation modeling reveals that extraversion and conscientiousness have a negative effect on consumer animosity, whereas neuroticism and openness are positively associated with this feeling. However, no significant relationship was observed between animosity and agreeableness. In turn, consumer animosity was found to influence product avoidance, and this association became stronger in the case of consumers that have higher levels of power distance, uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and masculinity. The study also showed that male and educated consumers are more likely to harbor animosity toward a hostility-evoking country, while age and income had no control effect on animosity. Several implications for theory and practice are derived from the study findings, and directions for future research are provided.

TI Do Export Learning Processes Affect Sales Growth in Exporting
   Activities?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The understanding of experiential learning through export learning process (XLP), and its outcomes, is limited in the international marketing literature. Using multisource, time-lagged data of exporting firms in the United Kingdom and China, this study finds that XLP is positively associated with marketing strategy adaptation for both U.K. and Chinese exporters. Results suggest contrasting moderating effects of experiential knowledge resources (i.e., psychic dispersion, multinationality, and duration) and strategy adaptation on the relationship between XLP and export sales growth in the two samples. In the U.K. sample, the authors observe a positive moderation effect of psychic dispersion and negative moderation effects of multinationality and duration. For the China sample, they find the exact opposite pattern of moderation effects for the experiential knowledge resources. Marketing strategy adaptation plays a negative moderation role in the China sample but has no such effect in the U.K. sample. The study has implications for theory development on, and the productive management of, processes of learning export management.

TI Dual Business Relationships, Opportunity Knowledge, and New Product
   Development: A Study on Returnee Young Ventures
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The effects on innovation of the dual embeddedness of returnee young ventures (RYVs) in both domestic and international networks of relationships and knowledge contexts are important for value creation, growth, and success of these firms and embody a unique research opportunity. Drawing on a framework combining a business relationship perspective and the knowledge-based view, the authors propose that RYVs take advantage of business relationships and opportunity knowledge from both international and domestic markets to nurture their innovation. They test their model on a sample of 200 RYVs in China. The findings reveal that business relationships are essential for acquiring knowledge about technological and business opportunities, though only international opportunity knowledge and domestic business relationships positively influence new product development. In addition, the interaction between international and domestic business relationships constrains firms' capacity for obtaining international opportunity knowledge. This study offers insights into how the trade-offs between dual relationships and subsequently sourced knowledge contribute to new product development in emerging markets, and it extends the discussion on the paradox view of business relationships with geographically dispersed actors.

TI Toward a Universal Account of Country-Induced Predispositions:
   Integrative Framework and Measurement of Country-of-Origin Images and
   Country Emotions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Understanding how consumers use a product's country-of-origin (COO) cue is fundamental to explaining their behavior in a globalized marketplace. While the study of COO is one of the most popular topics in international marketing, the ambiguity regarding its conceptualization, composite nature, operationalization, and measurement deserves further scrutiny. The authors propose an integrative framework that unites two separate areas of research on the COO cue: performance-related COO images and performance-unrelated country emotions. The authors reconcile diverse existing perspectives from both areas into the overarching country-induced predispositions model. Conceptualizations and measurement approaches for the model's five components are developed and empirically validated across three countries and with five COOs. The model offers researchers and managers with an interest in the COO cue a flexible and operational roadmap, with scales both for in-depth analyses and parsimonious additional testing.

TI Nonlinear Effects of Dynamic Export Pricing on Export Sales: A
   Longitudinal Investigation
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Little is known in the literature about dynamic export pricing, and particularly how the external environment interacts with a firm's export pricing decisions and its long-term effect on export sales. Therefore, this study develops a longitudinal framework to examine the quadratic effect of dynamic export pricing and its interaction with customer/competitive turbulence on export sales. By employing product-level longitudinal data, the authors also estimate the lagged effect from past dynamic export pricing and export sales while simultaneously controlling for endogeneity and unknown firm heterogeneity. The results indicate that dynamic export pricing appears to have inverted quadratic effects on export sales; this quadratic relationship is moderated by customer turbulence and competitive turbulence. The authors also focus on the changes of the curve and shifts of the turning point and delineate the fit lines that pinpoint the optimal dynamic export pricing in different export markets. Finally, previous actions and outcomes significantly influence the following year's export sales, which explains the long-term relationships.

TI Enhancing Consumer Attitude Toward Culturally Mixed Symbolic Products
   from Foreign Global Brands in an Emerging-Market Setting: The Role of
   Cultural Respect
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The extant literature has not examined the conditions that govern integrative and exclusionary reactions to cultural hybrid products with sufficient detail. Within an emerging-market setting, this study explores how culturally mixed symbolic products (CMSPs) from foreign global brands can avoid antagonistic consumer attitudes. Building on social categorization theory, the authors argue that foreign global brands are viewed as belonging to an out-group and may thus encounter difficulties in tapping local cultural capital, resulting in a negative relationship between brand globalness and consumer attitude toward CMSPs. However, they contend that product category moderates this relationship such that there is a stronger negative effect for nonfood products than for food products. Moreover, the authors theorize that (I) cultural respect by foreign global companies directly enhances consumer attitudes toward CMSPs and (2) cultural respect attenuates the negative brand globalness-CMSP attitude link. These hypotheses are tested using a representative consumer sample from eight provinces/municipalities in China (n = 646). Results provide important implications for global companies on how to benefit from local cultural resources in their localization processes.

TI The Role of Cultural Distance Across Quantiles of International Joint
   Venture Longevity
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Rapid global economic development and liberalization have increased the motivation and opportunities for firms to enter into international joint venture (IJV) agreements. Numerous studies in the international marketing literature have examined the impact of international partners' cultural differences on IJV longevity; however, results are inconclusive, potentially due to limitations in the methods used. While this study examines the varied impact of cultural differences on IJV longevity based on the IJV's age, it uses quantile regression, enabling the detection of varying effects' strengths across the dependent variable's entire distribution. The results demonstrate variations in the role of cultural differences across individual cultural dimensions as well as variations in the patterns of association between cultural differences and IJV longevity dependent on the IJV's age. Implications for theory and the practice of international marketing are offered as well as potential applications of this study's methodological approach.

TI The Influence of Global Brand Distribution on Brand Popularity on Social
   Media
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The literature on consumer choice between global and local brands is focused on sales-based measures of brand globalness (BG). When managers need to establish an effective social media campaign to raise awareness of their brands' activities on social media, the literature focus may not provide clear guidance on how such measures can be applied to social media. This research contributes to global brand research by combining the literature streams on consumer social media engagement and global branding marketing strategies. First, to provide a managerial tool for this task, the authors propose two novel measures, BG and country brand popularity (CBP), based on consumers' brand activities on social media. Using these measures, the authors hypothesize that CBP is influenced by cultural, social, and economic factors, which is motivated by motivation-opportunity-ability theory. Using Facebook data covering the top 100 brands that operate across 50 countries in each of 51 industries, they show that CBP is influenced by BG and cultural, social, and economic characteristics.

TI On the Interplay Between Consumer Dispositions and Perceived Brand
   Globalness: Alternative Theoretical Perspectives and Empirical
   Assessment
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Although prior research is congested with constructs intended to capture consumers' dispositions toward globalization and global/local products, their effects appear to replicate with difficulty, and little is known about the underlying theoretical mechanisms. This investigation revisits the relationship between prominent consumer dispositions (consumer ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism, global/local identity, globalization attitude) and perceived brand globalness as determinants of consumer responses to global brands. Drawing on selective perception and social identity theories, the authors consider several theory-based model specifications that reflect alternative mechanisms through which key consumer dispositions relate to brand globalness and affect important brand-related outcomes. By employing a flexible model that simultaneously accounts for moderating, mediating, conditional, and direct effects, we empirically test these rival model specifications. A meta-analysis of 264 effect sizes obtained from 13 studies with 23 unique data sets and a total sample of 1,410 consumers raises concerns regarding the (potentially overstated) utility of consumer dispositions for explaining consumer responses to global brands. It also reveals a need for further conceptual contemplation of their function in international consumer research and managerial practice.

SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Despite the critical importance of emotional intelligence in effectively interacting with other people, its role has been overlooked in scholarly research on cross-border interorganizational relationships. Drawing on emotion regulation theory, the authors propose a model that conceptualizes links among exporters' emotional intelligence, key behavioral dimensions characterizing the atmosphere of the relationship with import buyers, and the resulting relational performance. They test the model with data collected from 262 Greek exporters using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that higher levels of exporter emotional intelligence enhance communication and social bonding with the importer while diminishing distance and conflict in their working relationship. Relational performance is positively influenced by communication and social bonding but negatively affected by distance and conflict. The results also reveal the moderating effect of both opportunism and interpartner incompatibility on the association between the exporter's emotional intelligence and the behavioral atmosphere of the relationship with import buyers.

TI Stock Market Reactions to New Product Launches in International Markets:
   The Moderating Role of Culture
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Prior research indicates the importance of new product launches across international markets for firm performance. However, little is known about if, and how, new product launches in international markets drive firm financial value. This study examines the drivers of stock market reactions to a new product introduction in a foreign country, along with the moderating impact of cultural context. Using a sample of 1,154 products in 34 product categories launched in 48 countries between 2011 and 2018, the authors investigate how product characteristics such as product innovativeness and product type affect abnormal stock reactions to a new product launch event. Furthermore, the authors assess the role of the national culture by considering the individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and indulgence characteristics of the country where the new product is launched. Results of a mixed-effects estimation model indicate that product launches in international markets with innovativeness and hedonism characteristics positively affect firm value. The effects of culture are complex and multifarious, providing valuable insights regarding the impact of new product introductions in global markets on firm value.

TI Digital Environment in Global Markets: Cross-Cultural Implications for
   Evolving Customer Journeys
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Digital technologies and digital media are changing the environments in which firms interact with customers. However, the evolution of digital organizational forms, customer technology use, and the nature of customer journeys differ significantly across global markets. Drawing on observations of customer journeys across different international markets, the authors propose a framework to explain the observed differences in terms of the cross-cultural and socioeconomic factors that influence customer journeys. The authors put forth several propositions built on logical extensions of the extant research findings and identify areas for future academic research. In addition, they outline the managerial implications arising from the application of the framework for multinational firms seeking to market their products and services across global markets.

TI Narrowband Influencers and Global Icons: Universality and Media
   Compatibility in the Communication Patterns of Political Leaders
   Worldwide
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB This article analyzes how political leaders communicate with their target audiences and examines whether they adopt a country-specific communication persona, or react to the global media-intensive environment by offering more universal communication. Politicians communicate through presentational (e.g., social media) and representational (e.g., press) outlets, and the compatibility between these outlets represents the leader's effectiveness in transmitting the desired messages to the audience. The authors of this study suggest a theoretical framework that classifies public figures' communication along two dimensions: universality (particular-universal) and media compatibility (low-high). The authors used language processing tools to study the sentiment, topic mixture, and use of pronouns by 61 global world leaders in more than 300,000 messages from the leaders' Twitter accounts and press articles. The results show a high level of universality across political leaders in sentiment, topic mixture, and pronoun usage. The media compatibility is high, with Twitter being slightly more positive. Most leaders fall within the categories of Cosmopolitan Antagonist (high universality, low media compatibility) and Global Icon (high universality, high media compatibility). Overall, the sentiment of their communications is positive. Popular topics include diplomacy, economy, corruption, and the Arab world. No significant relationship was found between the sentiment or communication topics and country characteristics.

TI The Digital and Physical Footprint of Dark Net Markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Over the past decade, the world has been contending with a growing set of challenges related to illicit traffic as advancements in technology, communications, and global integration facilitate the operation of black markets and greater organization of criminal activity. In this study, the dark web and associated dark net markets are introduced as an important context for scholars interested in international marketing. Furthermore, the scale, scope, and structure of the real-world drug trade is empirically analyzed as an example of the work possible within this dark world. The study concludes by highlighting key themes from the literature in international marketing scholarship and focuses on how they might be co-opted to contribute toward the understanding and countermarketing of illicit systems of exchange.

TI National Culture and Advertising Sensitivity to Business Cycles: A
   Reexamination
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The author reexamines the cyclical sensitivity of national advertising expenditure with a longitudinal data set of 59 countries over 35 years. In contrast to prior studies, the author examines the effects of the entire set of Hofstede culture dimensions to study cross-country variation in the advertising sensitivity and investigates how the emergence and growth of online advertising has transformed the cyclical sensitivity of advertising spending. National culture substantially affects advertising's cyclical sensitivity, but in different ways than hypothesized previously. Consistent with the literature, advertising sensitivity is lower in long-term-oriented and high-uncertainty-avoidant countries and is unrelated to individualism. However, power distance is unassociated with cyclical sensitivity, and masculinity and indulgence-the two dimensions ignored in previous research-reduce cyclical sensitivity. Moreover, there is evidence that culture operates differently for the cyclical sensitivity of online advertising. Advertising expenditure is cyclically much more sensitive than documented previously and has grown more so over time since the advent of online advertising. This study provides initial evidence that online spending is more elastic than traditional advertising and that traditional spending has become more procyclical. The author advances timely and refined empirical generalizations on the cyclical sensitivity of advertising expenditure.

TI Overcoming Institutional and Infrastructure Weaknesses in China via
   Online Third-Party Marketplaces
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB China is the world's second largest retail market and is expected to surpass the United States in 2020. This makes China a must-win market for global and local firms. However, manufacturers often find it hard to reach Chinese consumers due to China's institutional and infrastructure weaknesses. The advent of online third-party marketplaces provides manufacturers with a new model to tackle these challenges. The question remains, however, whether and to what extent joining online third-party marketplaces in China can generate market value. Using an event study methodology, the authors assess the net impact of online marketplace adoption in China on manufacturers' expected profitability. Although the abnormal returns are, on average, significant and positive, stock markets recognize that not all manufacturers can reap benefits. To delve deeper into this variation, the authors relate the abnormal returns to various sources of manufacturers' market knowledge and marketing capabilities. They find that less diversified manufacturers with marketplace experience are expected to achieve greater gains, irrespective of their origin. However, the effects of marketing strengths diverge for foreign and local firms.

TI The Rise of Online Grocery Shopping in China: Which Brands Will Benefit?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Online grocery in China is on the rise. With large differences in brands' abilities to secure a portion of China's online pie, a key question is what drives these differences. The authors derive how a brand's total sales change as the online grocery share goes up, and they show that it depends on two indices: (1) the brand's online index (brand's online category share relative to its offline category share) and (2) the category's online index (category's grocery share online relative to its grocery share offline). The authors then identify brand and category factors that drive these indices. They estimate their model on 448 brands in 60 product categories in China using 2011-2015 data. Their analyses show that the brand online index mainly increases with higher levels of online availability, lower online-to-offline price ratios, and for "trusted," less "fun" brands. As for the category online index, expensive, less frequently bought categories benefit from the shift toward the online channel, whereas the opposite holds for perishable and heavy categories.

TI Intentional Cannibalization, Radical Innovation, and Performance: A
   Comparison of Chinese and Western Enterprises in China
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Research contrasting the marketing strategies of foreign and domestic firms within local markets is scarce but is of critical importance to both types of firms. This research examines how intentional cannibalization (IC) functions in Western and Chinese enterprises operating in China and evaluates IC's impact on radical innovation and subsequent performance while accounting for the moderating effects of cost leadership and differentiation strategies. The investigation uncovers important marketing strategy concerns for firms competing in emerging markets such as China. The results demonstrate that IC on its own correlates with radical innovation for Western firms, but not for Chinese firms. For Chinese firms, the link between IC and radical innovation becomes significant only in combination with a cost leadership strategy. For Western firms, the link between IC and radical innovation is strengthened when these firms pursue a differentiation strategy and, in contrast to Chinese firms, radical innovation mediates the effect between IC and performance. Thus, the way IC and radical innovation affect performance varies across Western and Chinese enterprises. These findings bolster and extend research regarding strategies of local and nonlocal firms in home markets.

TI Engaging Customer Cocreation in New Product Development Through Foreign
   Subsidiaries: Influences of Multinational Corporations' Global
   Integration and Local Adaptation Mechanisms
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Efforts to engage customers in cocreating new products have garnered much research attention from studies documenting customer cocreation's (CC's) positive impact on firm innovation and performance. Less research, however, has counterbalanced the bright side with the potential dark side of CC, especially as a strategy for multinational corporations (MNCs) operating in foreign markets. This study examines how MNC subsidiaries' CC affects new product innovativeness and knowledge leakage to competitors. Adopting a broader agency perspective to recognize that subsidiaries often do not perform up to headquarters' expectations due to both self-serving opportunism and honest incompetence, this study explores how CC effects are contingent on MNCs' global management mechanisms. Using a dyadic managerial survey of 238 MNC subsidiaries, the authors find that MNCs can control knowledge leakage by implementing proper global integration and local adaptation mechanisms. However, CC may not improve new product innovativeness, except when the subsidiary has low local research-and-development staff influence. This study contributes to the CC literature by showing its benefits, challenges, and boundary conditions as a growing MNC innovation strategy.

TI The Origins of Trust Asymmetry in International Relationships: An
   Institutional View
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Trust is key to relationship marketing. Although trust is bilateral, studies on the dispersion of trust among exchange parties remain limited, leaving the antecedents and outcomes of trust asymmetry largely underexplored. To fill the gaps, this study empirically examines the effects of different types of trust asymmetry on exchange performance and then investigates the institutional origins of trust asymmetry in international interfirm exchanges. Drawing on a survey of 134 international buyer-supplier relationships in China, the study finds that both calculative trust asymmetry and relational trust asymmetry have negative influences on exchange performance. The study also finds that formal institutional distance constrains calculative trust asymmetry and informal institutional distance increases relational trust asymmetry. Moreover, prior interactions and expectations of continuity significantly moderate the effects of formal and informal institutional distance. This study advances trust studies in cross-border settings.

TI Financial Development and Country-Level Advertising Spending: The
   Moderating Role of Economic Development and National Culture
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Firms invest in brand capital through advertising. Financial constraints hinder firms' ability to fund their investment projects. Empirical studies in the finance literature suggest that firms' access to external financial resources, labeled "financial development," affects their investment behavior. The authors take the view of advertising spending as investment in brands and study the effect of financial development on advertising spending at the country level using a panel of 59 developing and developed countries during 1990-2016. The results suggest that financial development has a positive and significant effect on advertising spending, and this effect is stronger in countries with a low level of economic development. Furthermore, the authors investigate the role of national culture dimensions including uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, collectivism, masculinity, and power distance in the relationship between financial development and advertising. Overall, the results provide evidence that the impact of financial development on advertising spending depends on the national culture dimensions.

TI The Firm Value and Marketing Intensity Decision in Conditions of
   Financial Constraint: A Comparative Study of the United States and Latin
   America
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Marketing managers generally have to make marketing decisions under financial constraints (i.e., the firm's inability to generate cash flow for investments and marketing), with limited assurance of the outcomes. Little investigation has been made into the effect of financial constraints on marketing intensity and the subsequent effect on firm value and performance, particularly when it is a volatile environment (e.g., Latin America) that creates the financial constraints. Using a conceptual framework grounded in agency theory, the authors develop a model and test it using a panel data set from the United States and five Latin American countries. The results indicate that financial constraints have a negative effect on marketing intensity and ultimately negatively affect firm value and performance. Furthermore, this study confirms the effect of three moderators-market sensitivity, country governance quality, and country economic development distance-on the relationship between financial constraint and marketing intensity and helps explain differences across the United States and Latin America.

TI Lit Up or Dimmed Down? Why, When, and How Regret Anticipation Affects
   Consumers' Use of the Global Brand Halo
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Research has long established the existence of a global brand halo that benefits global brands by triggering "global equals better" inferences by consumers. Nevertheless, little is known about the conditions under which this halo may or may not be used or about whether and, if so, how it can situationally fade. Drawing from regret theory, the authors posit that anticipating regret can conditionally both attenuate and accentuate consumers' use of the global brand halo and develop a serial conditional process model to explain the mechanism underlying regret's influence. The results of two experimental studies show that anticipated regret affects global brand halo use-and subsequently relative preference for global or local brands-by increasing consumers' need to justify their purchase decision. Whether and how consumers will use the global brand halo depends on consumers' product category schema, while the intensity of the halo's use depends on consumers' maximization tendency. The findings offer a decision-theory perspective on the competition between global and local brands and empirically based advice on managerial interventions that can influence global or local brand market shares.

TI Eco-Innovations in Global Markets: The Effect of Ecological
   (In)Congruence on Consumers' Adoption Intentions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Eco-innovations are increasingly manufactured and consumed across national borders. Although global outsourcing can be financially profitable, it is questionable whether consumers respond to eco-innovations manufactured in different countries in the same way. This article introduces the ecological country-of-manufacture (COM) concept, which reflects consumers' perception of a country's commitment to sustainable development policy and practices. Drawing on schema theory, the current research examines how consumer reactions to "ecological (in)congruence"-when the sustainability reputation of a COM is a (mis)match with product eco-friendliness levels-vary across product categories (Study 1a), consumption contexts (Study 1b), and national settings (Study 2). Consumers report more preferential evaluations when there is ecological incongruence for privately consumed products and ecological congruence for publicly consumed products. The results also demonstrate the differential moderating effects of socioeconomic development factors and cultural dimensions. In emerging markets with highly embedded, hierarchical, and high-harmony cultures, consumers require ecological congruence to justify their adoption decisions, whereas in developed markets with highly autonomous, egalitarian, and high-mastery cultures, consumers are more likely to adopt eco-innovations that are ecologically incongruent.

TI Revisiting Location in a Digital Age: How Can Lead Markets Accelerate
   the Internationalization of Mobile Apps?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Firms strategically expand to countries that offer important location advantages. Yet, for digital firms, which can instantly release their technologies worldwide, it is unclear whether a focus on specific locations can still provide strategic advantages. The authors argue that digital firms reap critical demand-side location advantages for the internationalization of their technologies by strategically interacting with users in lead markets that exhibit either high within-country demand heterogeneity or preference overlaps with several other countries. Simply penetrating a lead market is not enough, however, as both demand-side and supply-side factors influence the digital firm's potential to take advantage of lead markets. On the demand side, a digital firm should avoid focusing on paying users or acquiring light users. On the supply side, the digital firm must deploy adequate technological and marketing capabilities to benefit from user interactions in lead markets. Thus, the authors link demand-side opportunities and supply-side firm capabilities to develop nuanced theory on how digital firms can spur international expansion. They find empirical support for their arguments by analyzing a large multicounty database of mobile apps in Apple's App Store.

TI Expatriate Consumers' Adaptations and Food Brand Choices: A Compensatory
   Control Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB The number of expatriates has been steadily growing during the last two decades. For these reasons, academia has exhibited a growing research interest in expatriates' food consumption choices. Although interest is there, the extant literature is inconclusive about conditions under which expatriate consumers make trade-offs between host-country (local) and global food products and brands. The present study presents mechanisms that explain expatriate consumers' compensatory coping behaviors and choices between local versus global food brands. By drawing on compensatory control theory and the person-environment fit framework, the authors test the influence of adaptation efforts and retail system properties on expatriate consumers' food brand choices. Survey findings from 232 expatriates who currently live in five Middle Eastern countries reveal that a higher engagement in adaptation efforts (acculturation and general adjustment) leads to a dominant preference for local (vs. global) food brands. Moreover, this study illuminates the importance of retail system properties by showing that a host country's retail system development positively moderates the relationship between adaptation efforts and local food brand choices, whereas retail similarity has a negative impact.

It also explores the moderating role of external collaborations by differentiating between domestic collaborations and international collaborations. The authors tested their conceptual model with data from the U.K. Community Innovation Survey (2010-2016). Using different time lags for exploitation and exploration, the findings indicate that the impact varies over time. Specifically, they reveal that the effect of exploitation is negative in the long term but positive in the short term, while exploration has no significant effect in the short term but a positive influence on export sales growth in the long term. Similarly, the moderating effect of domestic and international collaborations has been found to vary over time. The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications.

TI Leveraging Interfirm Relationships in China: Western Relational
   Governance or Guanxi? Domestic Versus Foreign Firms
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB With the growing importance of strategic alliances and supply chains as competitive units, academics and practitioners are interested in understanding the techniques used by firms to leverage interfirm relationships to gain a competitive advantage. Studies conducted in the Western context underline the role of relational governance (i.e., the modern Western way), whereas works in the Chinese context highlight the importance of guanxi (i.e., the traditional Chinese way). Today's Chinese economy operates as a hybrid of the Western modern business model and traditional Chinese patterns with the coexistence of Western relational governance and guanxi. Therefore, this study addresses two issues: (1) whether these two types of governance interact as substitutes or complements in leveraging interfirm relationships and (2) whether and how foreign firms differ from their Chinese domestic counterparts in the use of these two types of governance to improve performance. Drawing on data collected from 132 third-party logistics providers in China, this study shows that Western relational governance and guanxi function as substitutes in improving performance. Moreover, while guanxi contributes to performance in a similar manner in Chinese domestic firms and foreign firms, Western relational governance is more effective for foreign firms than for Chinese domestic firms. Furthermore, the joint role (i.e., interaction effect) of Western relational governance and guanxi in improving performance also differs: these two forms of governance function as substitutes in foreign firms, whereas they have no significant interaction in Chinese domestic firms.

TI A Country-of-Origin Perspective on Climate Change Actions: Evidence from
   France, Morocco, and the United States
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Country-of-origin (COO) research cites the influence of country-level actions on consumers' attitudes but does not specify how such actions might influence the COO image, particularly in a climate change context. However, various countries adopt different climate change actions, with notable potential implications for products associated with the nations' images; therefore, it is vital to understand the relationship between climate change actions and consumers' attitudes toward their country. This study, which solicits responses from 1,389 consumers in France, Morocco, and the United States, investigates whether and how climate change actions influence each COO image and consumers' attitudes toward it, which vary with consumers' level of climate change concern. Such climate change actions also exert distinct effects that are moderated by the cultural context. Therefore, this study extends the COO literature to a climate change context and provides relevant implications for policy makers and marketing managers aiming to improve their COO image.

TI Prevention- Versus Promotion-Focus Regulatory Efforts on the Disease
   Incidence and Mortality of COVID-19: A Multinational Diffusion Study
   Using Functional Data Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB International marketing has rarely explored the diffusion patterns of the spread of a disease or analyzed the factors explaining the differences in the disease incidence patterns. The rapid diffusion of the novel coronavirus has engulfed the entire world in a very short time. Many countries experienced different levels of disease incidence and mortality despite implementing similar nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Drawing on the regulatory focus theory, the authors propose a framework to conceptualize and investigate the comparative efficacy of diverse NPIs that countries could adopt to prevent or curtail the diffusion of the disease incidence and mortality. They categorize these NPIs as prevention focused (containment and closures) or promotion focused (relief measures and public health infrastructure) and discuss the moderating factors that enhance or impede their effectiveness. Employing functional data analysis, the authors examine a comprehensive data set across 70 countries. They find that prevention-focused interventions inhibit disease incidence, while promotion-focused interventions enhance the nation's ability to respond to medical emergencies and augment people's ability to isolate themselves and slow the spread. The authors also generate insights on how a reallocation of resources between prevention- and promotion-focused efforts influence the evolution of disease incidence and mortality, with various countries falling in different clusters.

TI Perceived Brand Globalness/Localness: A Systematic Review of the
   Literature and Directions for Further Research
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Extensive research has investigated how perceived brand globalness (PBG) and perceived brand localness (PBL) affect brand. In this systematic literature review, the authors organize and synthesize the literature on PBG and PBL by analyzing 95 articles published in the past 17 years. They identify similarities, inconsistencies, and omissions in the literature by investigating different conceptualizations of PBG and PBL, boundary conditions of PBG and PBL effects on brand preference, psychological mechanisms through which PBG and PBL affect brand preference, the theoretical foundations underlying PBG and PBL research, and methodological approaches used in the literature. The study outlines avenues for further research based on prior research and current global trends, such as hybridization/glocalization marketing strategies, antiglobalization trends, and digitalization.

TI Perceived Export Performance: A Contingent Measurement Approach
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
AB Despite considerable research on export performance, relatively little scholarly attention has been devoted to incorporating managers' perspectives into operationalizing this concept. This study proposes a new approach for measuring small and medium-sized enterprises' export performance in the presence of multiple, potentially conflicting, goals while accounting for different approaches to assessing export performance. Adopting a contingency approach, the authors develop two customized measures of perceived export performance: the individualized perceived export performance framework and the simplified model. They demonstrate the application of both measures with a sample of 78 exporting small and medium enterprises in New Zealand and compare the outcomes. The proposed frameworks are intended to measure export performance considering managers' specific priorities and by incorporating manager- and firm-specific differences in the types and importance of goals, indicators, and benchmarks. This article extends the understanding of export performance by proposing a more nuanced and holistic measurement approach that is tailored to individual firms and reflects firm-specific idiosyncrasies.
