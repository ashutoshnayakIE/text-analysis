AB Many theories of consumer behavior involve thresholds and
   discontinuities. In this paper, we investigate consumers' use of
   screening rules as part of a discrete-choice model. Alternatives that
   pass the screen are evaluated in a manner consistent with random utility
   theory; alternatives that do not pass the screen have a zero probability
   of being chosen. The proposed model accommodates conjunctive,
   disjunctive, and compensatory screening rules. We estimate a model that
   reflects a discontinuous decision process by employing the Bayesian
   technique of data augmentation and using Markov-chain Monte Carlo
   methods to integrate over the parameter space. The approach has minimal
   information requirements and can handle a large number of choice
   alternatives. The method is illustrated using a conjoint study of
   cameras. The results indicate that 92% of respondents screen
   alternatives on one or more attributes.

AB his paper presents an initial examination of an emerging business model,
   the Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) channel, as popularized by priceline.com.
   Focusing on how to optimally structure such market interactions, I ask
   whether it is more profitable to restrict individuals to a single bid,
   as is currently done by Priceline, or conversely, to allow consumers to
   continue bidding if the previous offer was rejected. I find that both
   market structures yield the same expected profit. In practice, a
   single-bid policy may not be perfectly enforceable, especially in the
   Internet environment, because a sophisticated user can circumvent such a
   policy by camouflaging one's identity or otherwise manipulating the
   bidding procedure. Thus, Priceline's single-bid restriction is likely to
   result in Partial-Repeat-Bidding, the case in which some consumers are
   limited to a single bid while other, sophisticated users may rebid. I
   ask whether such surreptitious bidding is detrimental to the NYOP firm
   and find that profits are lower than if such opportunistic behavior were
   absent. Surprisingly, I find that the impact of the number of repeat
   bidders on profits is not monotonic. Thus, if it is prohibitively costly
   or logistically infeasible for the NYOP firm to eliminate surreptitious
   rebidding behavior, the firm may, in fact, benefit from encouraging,
   rather than discouraging, users to rebid. The direction that increases
   profits depends on the percentage of sophisticated bidders.

AB One of the main problems associated with early-period assessment of new
   product success is the lack of sufficient sales data to enable reliable
   predictions. We show that managers can use spatial dimension of sales
   data to obtain a predictive assessment of the success of a new product
   shortly after launch time.
   Based on diffusion theory, we expect that for many innovative products,
   word of mouth and imitation play a significant role in the success of an
   innovation. Because word-of-mouth spread is often associated with some
   level of geographical proximity between the parties involved, one can
   expect "clusters" of adopters to begin to form. Alternatively, if the
   market reaction is widespread reluctance to adopt the new product, then
   the word-of-mouth effect is expected to be significantly smaller,
   leading to a more uniform pattern of sales (assuming that there are no
   external reasons for clustering). Hence, the less uniform a product's
   distribution, the higher its likelihood of generating a "contagion
   process" and therefore of being a success. This is also true if the
   underlying baseline distribution is nonuniform, as long as it is an
   empirical distribution known to the firm.
   We use a spatial divergence approach based on cross-entropy divergence
   measures to determine the "distance" between two distribution functions.
   Using both simulated and real-life data, we find that this approach has
   been capable of predicting success in the beginning of the adoption
   process, correctly predicting 14 of 16 actual product introductions in
   two product categories. We also discuss the limitations of our approach,
   among them the possible confusion between natural formation of
   geodemographic clusters and word-of-mouth-based clusters.

AB When is inducing intrabrand competition (via nonexclusive distribution)
   an optimal strategy? To address this issue, a static model is developed
   to examine two settings. The manufacturer uses exclusive distributors in
   the first setting and nonexclusive distributors in the second. The
   analysis indicates that the choice of distribution rests critically on
   whether the manufacturer can effectively extract surplus from the
   distributors. Due to a variety of institutional reasons, the
   distributors' liability is often limited in performing on behalf of the
   manufacturer; such limited liability restricts how much of the
   distributors' surplus can be extracted. When the distributors' surplus
   cannot be fully extracted, the manufacturer may prefer nonexclusive
   distribution even when distributors can free-ride on each other's
   efforts.

AB In this paper, we provide theoretical arguments and empirical evidence
   for how Genetic Algorithms (GA)can be used for efficient estimation of
   macro-level diffusion models. Using simulations we find that GA and
   Sequential Search-Based-Nonlinear Least Squares (SSB-NLS) provide
   comparable parameter estimates when the data including peak sales are
   being used, for a range of error variances, and true parameter values
   commonly encountered in the literature. From empirical analyses we find
   that the forecasting performance of the GA estimates is better than that
   of SSB-NLS, Augmented Filter, Hierarchical Bayes, and Kalman Filter when
   only pre-peak sales data is available for estimation. When sales data
   until the peak time period are available for estimation, SSB-NLS is able
   to obtain parameter estimates when the starting values provided are the
   estimates from using GA. The estimates from GA are not biased and do not
   change in a systematic fashion when postpeak sales data are used,
   whereas the estimates from SSB-NLS are biased and change in a systematic
   fashion. Summarizing, we find that GA may be better suited for diffusion
   model estimation under the three conditions where SSB-NLS has been found
   to have problems.

   well-established practices in industry. However, as technology advances,
   it might be possible to foresee some more enduring trends and focus
   research on future issues rather than on past issues. One approach would
   be to study emerging technologies with rapidly declining costs. Each of
   these emerging technologies spawns myriad applications that have the
   potential to dramatically impact existing markets. Interesting research
   topics include the study of the impact of these applications on
   different market participants (e.g., final consumers, the seller, the
   seller of complementary services, intermediaries, information providers,
   competitors, other industries). Research topics also include the optimal
   structure for products and services, given these new applications, as
   well as which intermediary should offer particular services. Research
   topics also include the interactive ability to rapidly customize
   marketing strategy by identifying individuals at particular points in

   include enhanced search services, biometrics and smart cards, enhanced
   computational speed, M-commerce, and GPS tracking.

AB Franchisees within large branded chains loudly complain of a form of
   channel conflict known as "encroachment" or "impact." Encroachment
   occurs when franchisors add new units of their brand proximately to
   their franchisees' existing units. Franchisees claim that their revenues
   have substantially decreased as a result of encroaching same-brand
   entry. The topic, of encroachment has not only dominated franchisee
   association agendas and trade journal headlines but has also become a
   hot topic for politicians and policymakers. Yet, until now, evidence of
   encroachment has been strictly anecdotal. This paper provides the first
   systematic evidence of encroachment. Using revenue data from the Texas
   lodging industry in the 1990s, I find that when franchisors approve new
   same-brand units in the vicinity of incumbent units, these new units
   cannibalize the incumbents' revenues. In contrast to the result for
   franchisors, the addition of a new unit by company-owned brands in the
   vicinity of same-brand units is associated with an increase in the
   incumbents' revenues. This contrast suggests that encroaching behavior
   is caused by incentives that result from the governance form of
   franchising and is not simply an outcome that accompanies all expansion.
   This finding informs theory on governance forms and exclusive
   territories. Implications for practitioners and policy are also
   discussed.

AB Buyer search costs for price are changing in many markets. Through a
   model of buyer and seller behavior, I consider the effects of changing
   search costs on prices both when product differentiation is fixed and
   when it is endogenously determined in equilibrium. If firms cannot
   change product design, lower buyer search costs for price lead to
   increased price competition. However, if product design is a decision
   variable, lower search costs for price may also lead to higher product
   differentiation, which decreases price competition. In this case, the
   overall effect of lower buyer search costs for price may even be higher
   prices, lower social welfare, and higher industry profits. The result is
   especially interesting because recent technological changes, such as
   Internet shopping, can affect the market structure through lowering
   buyer search costs.

AB This paper proposes a descriptive model of the spatial and temporal
   evolution of retail distribution for new packaged goods. The
   distribution model postulates separate processes for local market entry
   by manufacturers, and adoption by retailers given entry. Of special
   interest is whether retail adoption occurs along a competitive network
   with retailers as nodes and overlapping trade areas of these retailers
   as links. The model is calibrated on data covering the introduction of
   two very successful new brands in the frozen pizza category. For these
   brands, manufacturers sequentially enter markets based on spatial
   proximity to markets already entered (spatial evolution), and on whether
   chains in these markets adopted previously elsewhere (market selection).
   A retail chain adopts new brands based on the adoption timing of
   competing chains within its trade territory (competitive contagion) and
   on the fraction of its trade area in which the new brand is available
   (trade area coverage). The effects of market selection and of trade area
   coverage create dependencies between market entry and retail adoption.
   Because of these dependencies the attraction of a particular market as a
   lead market depends on its location in the geographic structure of the
   U.S. retail trade.

AB The literature on structural equation models is unclear on whether and
   when multicollinearity may pose problems in theory testing (Type 11
   errors). Two Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that
   multicollinearity can cause problems under certain conditions,
   specifically: (1) when multicollinearity is extreme, Type 11 error rates
   are generally unacceptably high (over 80%), (2) when multicollinearity
   is between 0.6 and 0.8, Type 11 error rates can be substantial (greater
   than 50% and frequently above 80%) if composite reliability is weak,
   explained variance (R-2) is low, and sample size is relatively small.
   However, as reliability improves (0.80 or higher), explained variance
   R-2 reaches 0.75, and sample becomes relatively large, Type 11 error
   rates become negligible. (3) When multicollinearity is between 0.4 and
   0.5, Type 11 error rates tend to be quite small, except when reliability
   is weak, R-2 is low, and sample size is small, in which case error rates
   can still be high (greater than 50%). Methods for detecting and
   correcting multicollinearity are briefly discussed. However, since
   multicollinearity is difficult to manage after the fact, researchers
   should avoid problems by carefully managing the factors known to
   mitigate multicollinearity problems (particularly measurement error).

AB Standard diffusion models capture social contagion only coarsely and do
   not allow one to operationalize different contagion mechanisms.
   Moreover, there is increasing skepticism about the importance of
   contagion and, as has long been known, S-shaped diffusion curves can
   also result from heterogeneity in the propensity to adopt. We present
   hypotheses about conditions under which specific contagion mechanisms
   and income heterogeneity are more pronounced, and test these hypotheses
   using a meta-analysis of the q/p ratio in applications of the Bass
   diffusion model. The ratio is positively associated with the Gini index
   of income inequality in a country, supporting the
   heterogeneity-in-thresholds interpretation. The ratio also varies as
   predicted by the Gamma-Shifted Gompertz diffusion model, but the
   evidence vanishes after controlling for national culture. As to
   contagion, the q/p ratio varies with the four Hofstede dimensions of
   national culture-for three of them in a direction consistent with the
   social contagion interpretation. Furthermore, products with competing
   standards have a higher q/p ratio, which is again consistent with the
   social contagion interpretation. Finally, we find effects of national
   culture only for products without competing standards, suggesting that
   technological effects and culturally moderated social contagion effects
   might not operate independently from each other.

AB Managers are very interested in word-of-mouth communication because they
   believe that I product's success. is related to the word of mouth that
   it generates. However, there are at least three significant challenges
   associated with measuring word of mouth. First, how does one gather the
   data? Because the information is exchanged in private conversations,
   direct observation traditionally has been difficult. Second, what aspect
   of these conversations should one measure? The third challenge comes
   from the fact that word of mouth is not exogenous. While the mapping
   from word of mouth to future sales is of great interest to the firm, we
   must also recognize that word of mouth is an outcome of past sales. Our
   primary objective is to address these challenges. As a context for our
   study, we have chosen new television (TV) shows during the 1999-2000
   seasons. Our source of word-of-mouth conversations is Usenet, a
   collection of thousands of newsgroups with diverse topics. We find that
   online conversations may offer an easy and cost-effective opportunity to
   measure word of mouth. We show that a measure of the dispersion of

   traditional multinomial probit and first-order Markov models predict
   paths poorly. These results suggest that paths may reflect a user's
   goals, which could be helpful in predicting future movements at a

   information. This technique could be used to personalize Web designs and

AB Long-term marketing effectiveness is a high-priority research topic for
   managers, and emerges from the complex interplay among dynamic reactions
   of several market players. This paper introduces restricted policy
   simulations to distinguish four dynamic forces: consumer response,
   competitor response, company inertia, and company support. A rich
   marketing dataset allows the analysis of price, display, feature,
   advertising, and product-line extensions.
   The first finding is that consumer response differs significantly from
   the net effectiveness of product-line extensions, price, feature, and
   advertising. In particular, net sales effects are lip to five times
   stronger and longer-lasting than consumer response. Second, this
   difference is not due to competitor response, but to company action. For
   tactical actions (price and feature), it takes the form of inertia, as
   promotions last for several weeks. For strategic actions (advertising
   and product-line extensions), support by other marketing instruments
   greatly enhances dynamic consumer response. This company action negates
   the postpromotion dip in consumer response, and enhances the long-term
   sales benefits of product-line extensions, feature, and advertising.
   Therefore, managers are urged to evaluate company decision rules for
   inertia and support when assessing long-term marketing effectiveness.

AB The paper "Manufacturer's Returns Policies and Retail Competition" by
   Padmanabhan and Png (1997) argues that returns policies intensify retail
   competition and therefore raise the manufacturer's profits. They reach
   that result through a problematic method to solve the game.
   Particularly, in the game where the manufacturer accepts returns, they
   unreasonably assume the retailers would never face stock constraints,
   thus changing the retail competition from a Cournot-like competition to
   a Bertrand one. Actually, in a game where retailers first order stocks
   and then compete by choosing prices, even if a manufacturer offers full
   return policies, the retailers can still use "insufficient" stocks as
   quantities precommitment in order to uphold retail prices. Hence, the
   retailers still face stock constraints at the final stage of the game.
   The nature of the game is essentially unaffected by returns policies
   when demand is certain. This note shows that returns policies do not
   intensify retail competition in the model proposed by Padmanabhan and
   Png (1997).

AB Returns policies are common in many sectors of retail distribution.
   Padmanabhan and Pug (1997) showed that with demand uncertainty, a
   returns policy could improve manufacturer profitability under certain
   conditions. Wang (2004) showed that returns policies do not change
   manufacturer profitability when demand is certain and retailing is
   competitive. We show that returns policies do increase manufacturer
   profitability by attenuating retailer price competition when demand is
   low and intensifying competition when demand is high. Importantly, this
   effect holds only in the presence of demand uncertainty. Further, the
   conditions under which a returns policy raises the manufacturer's profit
   are weaker when retailing is a duopoly than when retailing is a
   monopoly. This suggests that returns policies serve both to manage
   competition and mitigate demand uncertainty.

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that one of the goals of manufacturer
   advertising is to reduce the cross-price elasticity between products
   (make one's own and rivals' products appear to be less substitutable in
   the eyes of consumers). Conventional wisdom also suggests that, all else
   being equal, retailers will be able to obtain better terms of trade from
   manufacturers the more substitutable are the manufacturers' products. It
   follows that retailers should be opposed to advertising that has the
   effect of reducing cross-price elasticities and thus that manufacturer
   advertising can be a source of channel conflict. We show that these
   conventional wisdoms need not hold when only some consumers are exposed
   to the advertising messages. Using a Hotelling model of demand, we show
   that (1) manufacturers can be worse off from advertising that reduces
   the cross-price elasticities between their products, (2) channel
   conflict need not arise, even when the sole purpose of advertising is to
   affect cross-price elasticities, and (3) depending on its bargaining
   power, a retailer can be better off when the manufacturers' products are
   perceived to be less substitutable.

AB We use the results of three large-scale field experiments to investigate
   how the depth of a current price promotion affects future purchasing of
   first-time and established customers. While most previous studies have
   focused on packaged goods sold in grocery stores, we consider durable
   goods sold through a direct mail catalog. The findings reveal different
   effects for first-time and established customers. Deeper price discounts
   in the current period increased future purchases by first-time customers
   (a positive long-run effect) but reduced future purchases by established
   customers (a negative long-run effect). Overall, the results show
   evidence of several long-run effects: forward buying, selection,
   customer learning, and increased deal sensitivity. Short-run metrics
   that ignore these effects overstate the overall change in demand for
   established customers. The implication is that if prices are set based
   on short-run elasticity, then they will be too low. Among first-time
   customers, the short-run metrics underestimate the total increase in
   demand. If prices are set based on short-run elasticity then they will
   be too high.

AB The issue of delegating pricing responsibility to the salesforce is of
   interest to marketing academics and practitioners. It has been shown by
   Lal (1986) that under certain situations with information asymmetry, it
   is more profitable for the firm to delegate pricing authority to the
   salesforce than to have centralized pricing. In this paper we re-examine
   situations where information asymmetry exists and analyze its effect on
   the decision of the firm to set a price or delegate pricing
   responsibility to the salesforce. Using contract theory, we find that
   when the salesperson's private information can be revealed to the firm
   through contracting, centralized pricing performs at least as well as
   price delegation. We derive the optimal centralized pricing contract
   under a set of standard assumptions used in the economics and business
   literature.

AB This paper empirically investigates the determinants of retailers'
   pricing decisions. It finds that competitor factors explain the most
   variance in retailer pricing strategy. Only in the cases of
   price-promotion coordination and relative brand price do category and
   chain factors explain much variance in retailer pricing. These findings
   are derived from a simultaneous equation model of how underlying
   dimensions of retailers' pricing strategies are influenced by variables
   representing the market, chain, store, category, brand, customer, and
   competition. The optical scanner data base describes 1,364 brand-store
   combinations from six categories of consumer packaged goods in five U.S.
   markets over a two-year time period. Our study classifies retailers'
   pricing strategies based on four underlying dimensions: price
   consistency, price-promotion intensity, price-promotion coordination,
   and relative brand price. These four pricing dimensions are
   statistically related to: (1) competitor price and deal frequency
   (competitor factors), (2) storability and necessity (category factors),
   (3) chain positioning and size (chain factors), (4) store size and
   assortment (store factors), (5) brand preference and advertising (brand
   factors), and (6) own-price and deal elasticities (customer factors).
   These findings are useful to retailers profiling alternative pricing
   strategies, and to manufacturers customizing the levels of marketing
   support spending for different retailers.

AB At the heart of a new product sales-forecasting model for consumer
   packaged goods is a multiple-event timing process. Even after
   controlling for the effects of time-varying marketing mix covariates,
   this timing process is not a stationary one, which means the standard
   interpurchase time models developed within the marketing literature are
   not suitable for new products.
   In this paper, we develop a dynamic changepoint model that captures the
   underlying evolution of the buying behavior associated with the new
   product. This extends the basic changepoint framework, as used by a
   number of statisticians, by allowing the changepoint process itself to
   evolve over time. Additionally, this model nests a number of the
   standard multiple-event timing models considered in the marketing
   literature.
   In our empirical analysis, we show that the dynamic changepoint model
   accurately tracks (and forecasts) the total sales curve as well as its
   trial and repeat components and other managerial diagnostics (e.g.,
   percent of triers repeating).

AB For several of the largest supermarket product categories, such as
   carbonated soft drinks, canned soups, ready-to-eat cereals, and cookies,
   consumers regularly purchase assortments of products. Within the
   category, consumers often purchase multiple products and multiple units
   of each alternative selected on a given trip. This multiple discreteness
   violates the single-unit purchase assumption of multinomial logit and
   probit models. The misspecification of such demand models in categories
   exhibiting multiple discreteness would produce incorrect measures of
   consumer response to marketing mix variables. In studying product
   strategy, these models would lead to misleading managerial conclusions.
   We use an alternative microeconomic model of demand for categories that
   exhibit the multiple discreteness problem. Recognizing the separation
   between the time of purchase and the time of consumption, we model
   consumers purchasing bundles of goods in anticipation of a stream of
   consumption occasions before the next trip. We apply the model to a
   panel of household purchases for carbonated soft drinks.

   reducing the difficulty associated with choosing between options.
   However, in certain circumstances recommendations play a less positive

   agent or agency and the person receiving the recommendation. Across a
   series of four studies, we explore consumer response when
   recommendations by experts and intelligent agents contradict the
   consumer's initial impressions of choice options. We find that
   unsolicited advice that contradicts initial impressions leads to the
   activation of a reactant state on the part of the decision maker. This
   reactance, in turn, leads to a behavioral backlash that results not only
   in consumers ignoring the agents' recommendations but in intentionally
   contradicting them.

AB Utility maximizing solutions to economic models of choice for goods with
   either discrete quantities or nonlinear prices cannot always be obtained
   using standard first-order conditions such as Kuhn-Tucker and Roy's
   identity. When quantities are discrete, there is no guarantee that
   derivatives of the utility function are equal to derivatives of the
   budget constraint. Moreover, when prices are nonlinear, as in the case
   of quantity discounts, first-order conditions can be associated with the
   minimum rather than the maximum value of utility. In these cases, the
   utility function must be directly evaluated to determine its maximum.
   This evaluation can be computationally challenging when there exist many
   offerings and when stochastic elements are introduced into the utility
   function. In this paper, we provide an economic model of demand for
   substitute brands that is flexible, parsimonious, and easy to implement.
   The methodology is demonstrated with a scanner panel data set of
   light-beer purchases. The model is used to explore the effects of price
   promotions on primary and secondary demand, and the utility of product
   assortment.

AB Prior work in marketing has suggested that advertising threshold
   effects-levels beneath which there is essentially no sales response-are
   rarely encountered in practice. Because advertising policies settle into
   effective ranges through early trial and error, thresholds cannot be
   observed directly, and arguments for their existence must be based
   primarily on a "statistical footprint," that is, on relative fits of a
   range of model types. To detect possible threshold effects, we formulate
   a switching regression model with two "regimes," in only one of which
   advertising is effective. Mediating the switch between the two regimes
   is a logistic function of category-specific dynamic variables (e.g.,
   order of entry, time in market, number of competitors) and advertising
   levels, nesting a variety of alternative formulations, among them both
   standard concave and S-shaped responses. A sequence of comparisons among
   parametrically related models strongly suggests: that threshold effects
   exist; that market share response to advertising is not necessarily
   globally concave; that superior fit cannot be attributed to model
   flexibility alone; and that dynamic, environmental, competitive, and
   brand-specific factors can influence advertising effectiveness. These
   effects are evident in two evolving durables categories (SUVs and
   minivans), although not in the one mature, nondurable category (liquid
   detergent) studied.

AB Competitive behavior in commercial television broadcasting is modeled to
   examine program choice and the effects of more channels being available
   on firm strategy. Specifically, broadcasters compete by selecting both
   the "type" and quality level of a program to offer, but do not compete
   on price. We obtain five major results. First, a comparison of monopoly
   and duopoly markets indicates that broadcasters in an industry with a
   larger number of competitors may provide programs of lower quality
   compared to broadcasters in an industry with a smaller number. Second,
   in terms of viewer welfare, having more channels available is not
   necessarily "better." Third, broadcasters tend to choose an intermediate
   level of differentiation in terms of the types of programs they provide,
   resulting in a "counterprogramming" strategy. In other words, avoidance
   of price competition is not required for competitors to differentiate
   themselves from each other. Fourth, if one broadcaster starts the
   evening with a higher-quality (higher-rated) program than its
   competitor, its second program should also be of higher quality.
   Finally, a broadcaster's first program should be of equal or higher
   quality than its second program. Put another way, it always behooves a
   broadcaster to "lead with its best."

AB In several markets, consumers can gain further information regarding how
   well a product fits their preferences only by experiencing it after
   purchase. This could then generate loyalty for the products tried first.
   This paper considers a model in which consumers learn in the first
   period about the product they buy and then make choices in the second
   period about the competing products, given what they learned in the
   first period. The paper finds that if the distribution of valuations for
   each product is negatively (positively) skewed, a firm benefits (is
   hurt) in the future from having a greater market share today-the brand
   loyalty characteristic. With negative skewness, two effects are
   identified: On one hand, marginal forward-looking consumers are less
   price sensitive than myopic consumers, and this is a force toward higher
   prices. On the other hand, forward-looking firms realize that they gain
   in the future from having a higher market share in the current period
   and compete more aggressively in prices. For similar discount factors
   for consumers and firms, the latter effect dominates. The paper also
   characterizes the importance of consumer learning effects on the market
   outcome.

AB The price for a product may be set too low, causing the seller to leave
   money on the table, or too high, driving away potential buyers.
   Contingent pricing can be useful in mitigating these problems. In
   contingent pricing arrangements, price is contingent on whether the
   seller succeeds in obtaining a higher price within a specified period.
   We show that if the probability of obtaining the high price is not too
   high, sellers profit from using contingent pricing while economic
   efficiency increases. The optimal contingent pricing structure depends
   on the buyer's risk attitude-a deep discount is most profitable if
   buyers are risk prone. A consolation reward is most profitable if buyers
   are risk averse. To motivate buyers to participate in a contingent
   pricing arrangement, the seller must provide sufficient incentives.
   Consequently, buyers also benefit from contingent pricing. In addition,
   because the buyers with the highest willingness-to-pay get the product,
   contingent pricing increases the efficiency of resource allocation.

   account for idiosyncratic consumer learning and preferences. The results
   point to the presence of heterogeneity in the valuation carryover
   coefficients across consumers and brands. In contrast to our
   expectations, a higher price is not important for most of the consumers
   in the sample. The model enables us to compare brands in terms of their
   memorability, which determines brand salience on the next purchase
   occasion. Our findings suggest that price promotions may be deficient as
   a tool to increase market share in the studied product category. The
   proposed model is applicable to other consumer goods contingent on
   consumers' being sufficiently motivated to learn their own preferences
   via personal experience. Brand managers can use the model for
   comparative diagnostics and market performance simulation under
   different price and promotion scenarios. This paper is instructive to
   the application of a relatively new methodology; we illustrate the

AB Brand loyalty and the more modern topics of computing customer lifetime
   value and structuring loyalty programs remain the focal point for a
   remarkable number of research articles. At first, this research appears
   consistent with firm practices. However, close scrutiny reveals
   disaffirming evidence. Many current so-called loyalty programs appear
   unrelated to the cultivation of customer brand loyalty and the creation
   of customer assets. True investments are up-front expenditures that
   produce much greater future returns. In contrast, many so-called loyalty
   programs are shams because they produce liabilities (e.g., promises of
   future rewards or deferred rebates) rather than assets. These programs
   produce short-term revenue from customers while producing substantial
   future obligations to those customers. Rather than showing trust by
   committing to the customer, the firm asks the customer to trust the
   firm-that is, trust that future rewards are indeed forthcoming. The
   entire idea is antithetical to the concept of a customer asset. Many
   modern loyalty programs resemble old-fashioned trading stamps or
   deferred rebates that promise future benefits for current patronage. A
   true loyalty program invests in the customer (e.g., provides free
   up-front training, allows familiarization or customization) with the
   expectation of greater future revenue. Alternative motives for extant
   programs are discussed.

   research documents a robust ranking effect-whereby a high-ranking
   product in a low-status category is favored over a low-ranking product
   in a high-status category even when information on competing categories
   is made available. We explain this effect in terms of narrow focusing
   and evaluability, and we identify boundary conditions of the effect.

AB Sellers often explicitly suggest to buyers that they compare one option
   to other (reference) options. Building on the notion that loss aversion
   is more pronounced when comparisons are explicit rather than implicit,
   we propose that the mere fact that consumers are explicitly told to make
   particular comparisons induces more risk-averse, cautious choice and
   bidding behavior. This proposition was supported in a field experiment
   involving real online auctions, in which comparisons among listings
   either were done spontaneously by bidders or were encouraged using an
   explicit instruction to compare the focal auction with adjacent
   listings. Results showed that explicit reference points (1) diminished
   the influence of adjacent auction prices on the focal auction's price;
   (2) led participants to submit fewer, lower, and later bids; (3)
   increased the incidence of sniping; (4) decreased bidding frenzy; and
   (5) decreased the tendency to bid on multiple items simultaneously. The
   impact of explicit comparisons on risk-averse behavior was further
   tested in a very different context using a laboratory choice experiment.
   In that study, explicit instructions to compare option sets increased
   the tendency to choose the compromise, low-risk, and all-average
   alternatives. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of
   this research.

AB Product reviews by third parties are growing in popularity. This paper
   examines when and how a manufacturing firm should adapt its marketing
   strategies to such reviews. For example, should a firm receiving an
   unfavorable review reduce its price or adjust its advertising? Should a
   winning product of a product review (e.g., "editor's choice") boost its
   advertising expenditure to spread the good news? How should firms'
   strategic responses to product reviews differ across different types of
   product reviews (description vs. recommendation) and different
   advertising media (the reviewer's publication vs. other media)?
   We develop a theory to address these issues and derive firms' optimal
   responses to product reviews under different product/market/review/media
   conditions. We show that firms should choose advertising rather than
   price as a strategic variable in response to product reviews when enough
   consumers value horizontal product attributes. Surprisingly, we find
   that using a review-endorsed advertising format (i.e., advertisements
   containing third-party award logos) to broadcast its victory can hurt
   the winning product of a product review. Also, it is not necessarily
   wise for the winning products to boost advertising expenditures to
   spread the good news. Data from two industries-printers and running
   shoes-are used to illustrate some of our findings.

AB We show that when a single media content distributor (such as a
   television cable company or an Internet provider) delivers advertising
   messages on behalf of multiple competing brands, it can sometimes
   utilize customized advertising to implement monopoly pricing. Even
   though such monopolistic pricing can be implemented with varying degrees
   of customization of commercials, product revenues and consumer surplus
   are highest when the distributor chooses the highest level of
   customization feasible. Consumers would, obviously, prefer aggressive
   price competition in product markets. However, given that collusion on
   prices is facilitated anyway, when the distributor acts as a common
   agent, the welfare of consumers is enhanced when commercials are better
   aligned with their preferences.

AB The retail trade today is increasingly dominated by large, centrally
   managed "power retailers." In this paper, we develop a channel model in
   the presence of a dominant retailer to examine how a manufacturer can
   best coordinate such a channel.
   We show that such a channel can be coordinated to the benefit of the
   manufacturer through either quantity discounts or a menu of two-part
   tariffs. Both pricing mechanisms allow the manufacturer to charge
   different effective prices and extract different surpluses from the two
   different types of retailers, even though they both have the appearance
   of being "fair." However, quantity discounts and two-part tariffs are
   not equally efficient from the manufacturer's perspective as a channel
   coordination mechanism. Therefore, the manufacturer must judiciously
   select its channel coordination mechanism.
   Our analysis also sheds light on the role of "street money" in channel
   coordination. We show that such a practice can arise from a
   manufacturer's effort to mete out minimum incentives to engage the
   dominant retailer in channel coordination. From this perspective, we
   derive testable implications with regard to the practice of street
   money.

AB We argue that standardized information disclosure (information using a
   common format and uniform metrics) creates asymmetric opportunities for
   firms, which affects their strategies and survival. We test our
   predictions using a longitudinal, quasi-experimental field study,
   involving the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA), and
   we focus on firm market share within a category as a key asymmetry.
   Findings indicate that, in general, the NLEA had no effect on firm
   responses. However, when accounting for firm differences, we observe
   that the NLEA led to (1) an increase in small-share firm exits and (2) a
   greater increase in distribution for large-share firms. No concurrent
   increase in price by large-share firms following the NLEA was observed.
   We conclude by discussing the implications of these effects for firm
   strategy, the design of public policy, and theories regarding the impact
   of information on markets.

AB Today's managers are very interested in predicting the future purchasing
   patterns of their customers, which can then serve as an input into
   "lifetime value" calculations. Among the models that provide such
   capabilities, the Pareto/NBD "counting your customers" framework
   proposed by Schmittlein et al. (1987) is highly regarded. However,
   despite the respect it has earned, it has proven to be a difficult model
   to implement, particularly because of computational challenges
   associated with parameter estimation.
   We develop a new model, the beta-geometric/NBD (BG/NBD), which
   represents a slight variation in the behavioral "story" associated with
   the Pareto/NBD but is vastly easier to implement. We show, for instance,
   how its parameters can be obtained quite easily in Microsoft Excel. The
   two models yield very similar results in a wide variety of purchasing
   environments, leading us to suggest that the BG/NBD could be viewed as
   an attractive alternative to the Pareto/NBD in most applications.

   and psychometric literature that the structure underlying preferences
   can change during the administration of repeated measurements (e.g.,
   conjoint analysis) and data collection because of effects from learning,
   fatigue, boredom, and so on. In this research note, we propose a new
   class of hierarchical dynamic Bayesian models for capturing such dynamic
   effects in conjoint applications, which extend the standard hierarchical
   Bayesian random effects and existing dynamic Bayesian models by allowing
   for individual-level heterogeneity around an aggregate dynamic trend.
   Using simulated conjoint data, we explore the performance of these new
   dynamic models, incorporating individual-level heterogeneity across a
   number of possible types of dynamic effects, and demonstrate the derived
   benefits versus static models. In addition, we introduce the idea of an
   unbiased dynamic estimate, and demonstrate that using a counterbalanced
   design is important from an estimation perspective when parameter
   dynamics are present.

   decreasing the precision of the estimation. We also examined the

   with continually increasing speeds and storage capabilities, the
   Internet, and mapping databases have enabled the development of systems
   that communicate alignments visually to sales managers. Because of their
   combinatorial complexity, multiple conflicting objectives, and personnel
   aspects that touch everyone in the salesforce, the alignment models were
   unable to completely solve the sales territory alignment issues faced by
   companies. Consequently, processes that add local managerial knowledge
   were used to communicate and enhance model-derived solutions, while
   achieving very high implementation rates.
   The territory alignment team gains knowledge with every sales territory
   alignment. Alignment insights get codified. Alignment experts improve
   every model-derived solution. This wisdom becomes part of subsequent
   alignments and triggers further innovation. Over time, the role of
   processes and wisdom becomes larger than the role of the models and

   increasing responsiveness to consumers' needs. The model has been used

   why a particular ad works in terms of the characteristics (or cues) of

   comprehensive method to evaluate the effect of TV advertising on sales
   by simultaneously separating the effects of the ad itself from that of
   the time, placement (channel), creative cues, repetition, age of the ad,
   and age of the market. It also captures ad decay by hour to avoid
   problems of data aggregation. No model in the literature provides such

   We then consider various generalizations of this model, such as allowing

   merchant unable to commit to a pricing policy, and allowing competition
   in the marketplace. In these cases we show that sellers will, in

AB Almost universally, research and practice suggest that a brand that
   increases its product assortment, or variety, should benefit through
   increased market share. In this paper, we show this is not always the
   case. We introduce the construct "assortment type" and demonstrate that
   the effect of assortment size on brand share is systematically moderated
   by assortment type. We define an "alignable" assortment as a set of
   brand variants that differ along a single, compensatory dimension such
   that choosing from that assortment only requires within-attribute
   trade-offs. In contrast, we define a "nonalignable" assortment as a set
   of brand variants that simultaneously vary along multiple,
   noncompensatory dimensions, demanding between-attribute trade-offs. In
   turn, we argue that an alignable assortment can efficiently meet the
   diverse tastes of consumers, thereby increasing brand share, but that a
   nonalignable assortment increases both the cognitive effort and the
   potential for regret faced by a consumer, thereby decreasing brand
   share. We term this effect "overchoice."
   Across three studies, we provide evidence of overchoice and tie the
   effect to the effort and regret brought about by nonalignability. In the
   process, we demonstrate that simplification of information presentation,
   reversibility of choice, and a reduction in underlying nonalignability
   serve to reduce or eliminate this effect.

   firms. We find that, in equilibrium, when the number of either competing
   networks or technologies increases, investments are more likely to be
   directed toward market, rather than product, development. Second, we
   consider the case in which firms continue to jointly develop a product
   but compete individually in the market. Our analysis suggests that
   forcing alliance partners to compete individually might not attenuate
   the underinvestment problem associated with new product alliances.
   Third, we extend the model to consider sequential market entry with
   rewards based on the order of entry, technology spillover, endogenous
   market size, and asymmetric technologies. Finally, key predictions of
   the basic model are tested in two experiments. The aggregate results
   provide strong support to the qualitative implications of the

   hierarchical Bayes, and the polyhedral methods using standard, widely
   used simulation data. The experiments show that the proposed method
   handles noise significantly better than both logistic regression and the
   recent polyhedral methods and is never worse than the best method among
   the three mentioned above. It can also be used for estimating
   nonlinearities in preference models faster and better than all other
   methods. Finally, a simple extension for handling heterogeneity shows
   promising results relative to hierarchical Bayes. The proposed method
   can therefore be useful, for example, for analyzing large amounts of
   data that are noisy or for estimating interactions among product
   features.

AB Over the years, researchers have found that promotion makes consumers
   switch brands and purchase earlier or more. However, it is unclear how
   promotion affects consumption, especially for product categories that
   are perceived to be versatile and substitutable. In this paper, we
   propose a dynamic structural model with endogenous consumption under
   promotion uncertainty to analyze the promotion effect on consumption.
   This model recognizes consumers as rational decision makers who form
   promotion expectations and plan their purchase and consumption decisions
   in light of promotion schedule. Applying the proposed model to packaged
   tuna and yogurt, we find that endogenous consumption responds to
   promotion as a result of forward-looking and stockpiling behavior. This
   is the first empirical paper that recognizes consumption as an
   endogenous decision variable and proposes a structural model to offer
   behavioral explanations on whether, how, and why promotion encourages
   consumption for product categories with flexible consumption.

AB Discrete choice models of aggregate demand, such as the random
   coefficients logit, can handle large differentiated products categories
   parsimoniously while still providing flexible substitution patterns.
   However, the discrete choice assumption may not be appropriate for many
   categories in which we expect consumers may purchase more than one unit
   of the selected item. We derive the aggregate demand system
   corresponding to a discrete/continuous household-level model of demand.
   We also propose a method-of-simulated-moments procedure that provides
   consistent estimates of the structural parameters when only aggregate
   data are available. The procedure also enables the researcher to control
   both for the potential endogeneity of marketing variables as well as
   potential heterogeneity in consumer tastes. Using our aggregate
   estimates, we can measure the decomposition of price elasticities into
   incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity components. We also
   propose several empirical tests to assess the validity of the
   discrete/continuous demand system versus that of the logit model. In
   several simulation experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of this
   model across datasets in which quantity choices may or may not be
   important. Our empirical calibration to store-level data in the
   refrigerated orange juice category indicates a considerable improvement
   in fit of the observed aggregate sales using the discrete/continuous
   model.

AB An important question that firms face in advertising is developing
   effective media strategy. Major improvements in the quality of consumer
   information and the growth of targeted media vehicles allow firms to
   precisely target advertising to consumer segments within a market. This
   paper examines advertising strategy when competing firms can target
   advertising to different groups of consumers within a market. With
   targeted advertising, we find that firms advertise more to consumers who
   have a strong preference for their product than to comparison shoppers
   who can be attracted to the competition. Advertising less to comparison
   shoppers can be seen as a way for firms to endogenously increase
   differentiation in the market. In addition, targeting allows the firm to
   eliminate "wasted" advertising to consumers whose preferences do not
   match a product's attributes. As a result, the targeting of advertising
   increases equilibrium profits. The model demonstrates how advertising
   strategies are affected by firms being able to target pricing. Target
   advertising leads to higher profits, regardless of whether or not the
   firms have the ability to set targeted prices, and the targeting of
   advertising can be more valuable for firms in a competitive environment
   than the ability to target pricing.

   effects of past customer behavior and conduct a longitudinal validation
   test to compare the performance of our model with that of commonly used
   segmentation models in predicting intermediate-term, customer-specific
   gross profit change. Our findings show that response to marketing
   interventions is highly heterogeneous, that heterogeneity of response
   varies across different marketing interventions, and that the
   heterogeneity of response to marketing interventions may be partially
   explained by customer-specific variables related to customer
   characteristics and the customer's past interactions with the company.
   One important result from these moderating effects is that
   relationship-oriented interventions are more effective with loyal
   customers, while action-oriented interventions are more effective with
   nonloyal customers. We show that our proposed model outperformed models
   based on demographics, recency-frequency-monetary value (RFM), or finite
   mixture segmentation in predicting the effectiveness of
   intermediate-term CRM. The empirical results project a significant
   increase in intermediate-term profitability over all of the competing

AB Delegating pricing decisions to the salesforce has been a salient issue
   for marketing academics and practitioners. We examine this issue in a
   competitive market using standard agency theory with symmetric and
   asymmetric information. Under symmetric information we find that the
   optimal contracts have a nice property that allows managers to reach the
   upper bound on firms' profit by using either centralized or delegated
   pricing, and hence there are no incentive-based reasons to prefer
   centralized versus delegated contract types. Thus, managers can focus on
   the design of the optimal incentive scheme without worrying about the
   contract type. Under asymmetric information we find that there always
   exists an equilibrium where all firms use centralized pricing that is
   either unique or payoff equivalent to equilibria that have a combination
   of contract types. These results are robust to a large class of agent
   and market parameters. However, if restrictions are exogenously imposed
   on contract form or observability, the above results are no longer true,
   as in earlier work. We demonstrate our results by providing explicit
   solutions under the Holmstrom and Milgrom (1987) framework.

AB Adaptive metric utility balance is at the heart of one of the most
   widely used and studied methods for conjoint analysis. We use formal
   models, simulations, and empirical data to suggest that adaptive metric
   utility balance leads to partworth estimates that are relatively
   biased-smaller partworths are upwardly biased relative to larger
   partworths. Such relative biases could lead to erroneous managerial
   decisions. Metric utility-balanced questions are also more likely to be
   inefficient and, in one empirical example, contrary to popular wisdom,
   lead to response errors that are at least as large as nonadaptive
   orthogonal questions. We demonstrate that this bias is because of
   endogeneity caused by a "winner's curse." Shrinkage estimates do not
   mitigate these biases. Combined with adaptive metric utility balance,
   shrinkage estimates of heterogeneous partworths are biased downward
   relative to homogeneous partworths. Although biases can affect
   managerial decisions, our data suggest that, empirically, biases and
   inefficiencies are of the order of response errors. We examine viable
   alternatives to metric utility balance that researchers can use without
   biases or inefficiencies to retain the desired properties of (1)
   individual-level adaptation and (2) challenging questions.

AB Past research reveals an extraordinary number and variety of transaction
   games, often with different rules. For example, buy and sell offers can
   be take-it-or-leave-it, irrevocable, of limited duration, negotiable,
   contingent on events, et cetera. The possible sets of rules seem
   endless.
   Past (often, very insightful) research has focused on optimization,
   given particular rules of the game. This focus often overlooks why
   players choose to play the game. 1ndeed, assuming that an exchange will
   occur makes the marketing function (e.g., facilitating exchanges)
   inconsequential. Unlike inescapable market games between rival firms,
   buyers and sellers often choose whether to play transaction games.
   Hence, game design (i.e., setting the rules of the game) becomes vital,
   because the design determines both the likelihood of desirable outcomes
   (e.g., the best transaction price) and whether (or how many) players
   will choose to play.
   We need more research revealing the desirability of various rule sets
   for different target groups and revealing rules that enhance the
   benefits to all players. For example, a particular auction game might
   provide sellers with liquidity (i.e., faster transactions) while
   providing buyers with unique items at bargain prices. We should also

AB Many emerging technologies exhibit path-dependent demands driven by
   positive network feedback. Such network effects profoundly impact
   marketing strategists' thinking in today's network economy. However, the
   significant network externalities expected by many people often fail to
   materialize in the emerging technology market. We analyze this
   phenomenon in the context of a technology distribution channel. By
   studying cheap-talk strategies under information asymmetry, we show that
   incentive-compatible contracts are essential for achieving credible
   information transmission. In our model, the better-informed technology
   vendor has an incentive to inflate the retailer's ex ante belief of
   network externalities when a wholesale price contract is adopted. When
   properly termed revenue-sharing contracts are implemented, there are
   information-efficient cheap-talk equilibria where truthful information
   transmission is mutually beneficial. When the vendor's information is
   imperfect, even revenue-sharing contracts cannot guarantee credible
   information transmission if there is significant prior belief disparity
   between the vendor and the retailer. This study demonstrates how
   information-inefficient equilibria (e.g., information blockage) arise
   because of the conflict of interest or the conflict of opinion among
   channel members. It also explores the role of cheap talk in facilitating
   channel coordination.

AB To increase the sales of their products through advertising, firms must
   integrate their brand-advertising strategy for capturing market share
   from competitors and their generic-advertising strategy for increasing
   primary demand for the category. This paper examines whether, when, and
   how much brand advertising versus generic advertising should be done.
   Using differential game theory, optimal advertising decisions are
   obtained for a dynamic duopoly with symmetric or asymmetric competitors.
   We show how advertising depends on the cost and effectiveness of each
   type of advertising for each firm, the allocation of market expansion
   benefits, and the profit margins determined endogenously from price
   competition. We find that generic advertising is proportionally more
   important in the short term and that there are free-riding effects
   leading to suboptimal industry expenditure on generic advertising that
   worsen as firms become more symmetric. Due to free-riding by the weaker
   firm, its instantaneous profit and market share can actually be higher.
   The effectiveness of generic advertising and the allocation of its
   benefits, however, have little effect on the long-run market shares,
   which are determined by brand-advertising effectiveness. Extensions of
   the model show that market potential saturation leads to a decline in
   generic advertising over time.

AB This paper investigates the competitive market for mass-customized
   products. Competition leads to surprising conclusions: Manufacturers
   customize only one of a product's two attributes, and each manufacturer
   chooses the same attribute. Custornization of both attributes cannot
   persist in an equilibrium where firms first choose customization and
   then choose price, because effort to capture market with customization
   makes a rival desperate, putting downward pressure on prices.
   Equilibrium involves partial or no custornization. In partial
   custornization, rival firms do not differentiate their
   mass-customization programs: If firms customize different attributes,
   many more consumers are indifferent between the two firms. The
   elasticity of demand is increased and the resulting price war makes
   differentiated custornization unprofitable. If firms customize the same
   attribute of a two-attribute product, they should concentrate on the
   attribute with the smaller heterogeneity in consumers' preferences.
   We incorporate consumers' effort in portraying their preferences as a
   cost of interaction and provide public policy findings on the well-being
   of these consumers: When this cost is low, consumers are better off with
   customization than with standard goods, but firms choose too little
   custornization. The loss in consumer surplus is sometimes captured by
   the firms, but for low interaction costs, firms' profit-driven behavior
   is economically inefficient.

   adversely affected. The variation in the assortment reduction's impact
   across categories suggests that managers compare select categories in
   order to moderate the overall loss in sales.

AB As the online channel matures, many firms are finding that an
   understanding of how their online customers' preferences and choices
   vary across geographical markets can be very useful. In this paper, we
   propose a spatial multinomial model of customer choice and illustrate
   how spatial modeling of choices of online customers across geographical
   markets provides useful insights in the context of a product mix and
   pricing decision of an online book publisher. The spatial multinomial
   model specifically accounts for the spatial correlations among customer
   choices among different product forms-print and PDE The estimation
   results obtained using data generated from an online experiment show
   that the spatial model accounts for the geographical variation in many
   of the unobserved effects possibly due to locational differences and
   price sensitivities. The resultant spatial decision maps provide useful
   predictions as to how purchase rates vary across geographical markets as
   a function of the price differential between product forms, with
   implications for targeting customers through local market advertising,
   direct marketing, and cross-channel promotion.

AB Understanding the lead-lag relationship between distribution and demand
   is an important and challenging issue for all marketers. It is
   particularly challenging in the movie industry, where the very short
   lifespan and decaying revenue and exhibition patterns of motion pictures
   means that the associated time series are short and nonstationary,
   rendering existing econometric methods unreliable. We propose an
   alternate method that uses state-space diagrams to determine lead-lag
   relationships. Straightforward to apply and interpret, it takes
   advantage of the eye's ability to see patterns that algebra-based
   formulations cannot easily recognize. A number of validation tests are
   provided to illustrate the usefulness and limitations of the method. We
   study the weekly data for 231 major movies released in 2000-2001. While
   econometric methods do not provide consistent results, the graphical
   method of visually inferred causality clearly shows a pattern that
   demand leads distribution for most movies. In other words, the dominant
   industry pattern is one of movie exhibitors monitoring box office sales
   and then responding with screen allocation decisions. The managerial
   implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Marketing Science features many and diverse articles that analyze
   competitive responsiveness. Although recent Marketing Science editorials
   (e.g., Shugan 2002) suggest that competitive responsiveness is only a
   part of a comprehensive competitive marketing strategy, it remains a
   vital part. For that reason and many others, Marketing Science is
   particularly proud of this special issue edited by David J. Reibstein
   and Dick R. Wittink.
   Before introducing and vigorously applauding both the editors and
   authors of this excellent special issue, we emphasize that competitive
   responsiveness raises numerous issues, including whether one can
   forecast outcomes of new policies based on past observations made under
   old policies (i.e., the Lucas critique) and decisions regarding which
   variables should be considered endogenous (Shugan 2004), i.e.,
   determined within the model.
   Perhaps, normative models are inherently perishable-evolution in market
   structure requires modifications over time. Also, although complete
   consistency within the world of the model is aesthetically pleasing,
   imposing industry-specific exogenous constraints (that might appear
   unrelated to the modeling assumptions) is sometimes necessary.

AB This research uses Procter & Gamble's value pricing initiative as a
   context for testing whether actual competitor and retailer response to a
   major policy change can be predicted using a game-theoretic model. We
   first estimate demand functions for P&G and competitor brands from the
   period before value pricing was initiated. We then formulate a dynamic
   manufacturer-retailer Stackelberg model that includes P&G, a
   national-brand competitor, and a retailer. The model takes P&G's move as
   given and prescribes the price and promotion response of the competitors
   and the retailer. We substitute the estimated demand parameters into the
   model to obtain prescriptions for each competitor and the retailer, and
   see whether these prescriptions are related to the actual response. We
   find that the dynamic game-theoretic model calibrated with empirical
   estimates of demand parameters has significant predictive power. We also
   test the predictive power of two benchmark models. The first is based on
   the reaction function approach of Leeflang and Wittink (Leeflang, Peter
   S. H., Wittink, Dick R. 1992. Diagnosing competitive reactions using
   (aggregated) scanner data. Internat. J. Res. Marketing 9 39-57.), and
   the second is a simplification of our dynamic model where the retailer
   is not strategic. The dynamic game-theoretic model performs better than
   either benchmark.

AB Companies spend millions of dollars on advertising to boost a brand's
   image and simultaneously spend millions of dollars on promotion that
   many believe calls attention to price and erodes brand equity. We
   believe this paradoxical situation exists because both advertising and
   promotion are necessary to compete effectively in dynamic markets.
   Consequently, brand managers need to account for interactions between
   marketing activities and interactions among competing brands. By
   recognizing interaction effects between activities, managers can
   consider interactivity trade-offs in planning the marketing-mix
   strategies. On the other hand, by recognizing interactions with
   competitors, managers can incorporate strategic foresight in their
   planning, which requires them to look forward and reason backward in
   making optimal decisions. Looking forward means that each brand manager
   anticipates how other competing brands are likely to make future
   decisions, and then by reasoning backward deduces one's own optimal
   decisions in response to the best decisions to be made by all other
   brands. The joint consideration of interaction effects and strategic
   foresight in planning marketing-mix strategies is a challenging and
   unsolved marketing problem, which motivates this paper.
   This paper investigates the problem of planning marketing mix in dynamic
   competitive markets. We extend the Lanchester model by incorporating
   interaction effects, constructing the marketing-mix algorithm that
   yields marketing-mix plans with strategic foresight, and developing the
   continuous-discrete estimation method to calibrate dynamic models of
   oligopoly using market data. Both the marketing-mix algorithm and the
   estimation method are general, so they can be applied to any other
   alternative model specifications for dynamic oligopoly markets. Thus,
   this dual methodology augments the decision-making toolkit of managers,
   empowering them to tackle realistic marketing problems in dynamic
   oligopoly markets.
   We illustrate the application of this dual methodology by studying the
   dynamic Lanchester competition across five brands in the detergents
   market, where each brand uses advertising and promotion to influence its
   own market share and the shares of competing brands. Empirically, we
   find that advertising and promotion not only affect the brand shares
   (own and competitors') but also exert interaction effects, i.e., each
   activity amplifies or attenuates the effectiveness of the other
   activity. Normatively, we find that large brands underadvertise and
   overspend on promotion, while small brands underadvertise and
   underpromote. Finally, comparative statics reveal managerial insights
   into how a specific brand should respond optimally to the changes in a
   competing brand's situation; more generally, we find evidence that
   competitive responsiveness is asymmetric.

AB How do competitors react to each other's price-promotion and advertising
   attacks? What are the reasons for the observed reaction behavior? We
   answer these questions by performing a large-scale empirical study on
   the short-run and long-run reactions to promotion and advertising shocks
   in over 400 consumer product categories over a four-year time span.
   Our results clearly show that the most predominant form of competitive
   response is passive in nature. When a reaction does occur, it is usually
   retaliatory in the same instrument, i.e., promotion attacks are
   countered with promotions, and advertising attacks are countered with
   advertising. There are very few long-run consequences of any type of
   reaction behavior. By linking reaction behavior to both cross- and
   own-effectiveness, we further demonstrate that passive behavior is often
   a sound strategy, while firms that do opt to retaliate often use
   ineffective instruments, resulting in "spoiled arms." Accommodating
   behavior is observed in only a minority of cases, and often results in a
   missed sales opportunity when promotional support is reduced. The
   ultimate impact of most promotion and advertising campaigns depends
   primarily on the nature of consumer response, not the vigilance of
   competitors.

AB The ability to keep up with changing technology is critical for a
   company's long-term survival. However, companies have to balance the
   risk of rushing into new areas and potentially cannibalizing their
   existing business against the risk of missing the emerging market. This
   paper investigates when incumbents enter into new market niches created
   by technological innovation. We argue that market conditions and
   company-specific characteristics do not suffice to explain incumbents'
   entry timing, but that entry is a contagious process. Our results
   demonstrate that incumbents are more likely to respond to innovations in
   their industry when their counterparts do so. In particular, we show
   that incumbents are affected by the entry of firms that are similar in
   size and resources. When a highly similar company enters the new market,
   it raises the probability that the company enters itself beyond levels
   based solely on the attractiveness of the market.

AB We study three determinants of the levels of price and detailing effort
   across geographic markets: the within-market response to each variable,
   the nature of interfirm, strategic interactions both within that market
   and across markets. We empirically examine the interactions of Prozac,
   Zoloft, and Paxil across the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,
   France, and Italy. Our results indicate that all three factors driving
   marketing mix interactions are at play in this product category. The
   U.S. market is less price-sensitive than the European markets. Detailing
   elasticities are comparable across the United States, Germany, and
   Italy, while the United Kingdom and France show greater elasticity. For
   the U.S. market, we find that almost all deviations from Nash pricing
   and detailing levels are due to within-market interactions. In the U.K.
   market, deviations from Nash prices come about due mostly to
   across-market interactions-both with the United States as well as the
   rest of Europe, whereas deviations from Nash detailing levels are mainly
   due to across-market interactions with the United States. For Italy, we
   observe that both within and across-market interactions affect price and
   detailing levels. Overall, the pattern of interactions makes observed
   prices more similar across countries than prices implied by the
   estimated elasticities. This underscores the importance of considering
   within- and across-market interactions in developing multimarket
   strategy.

AB We investigate differences in the dynamics of marketing decisions across
   geographic markets empirically. We begin with a linear-quadratic game
   involving forward-looking firms competing on prices and advertising.
   Based on the corresponding Markov perfect equilibrium, we propose
   estimable econometric equations for demand and marketing policy. Our
   model allows us to measure empirically the strategic response of
   competitors along with economic measures such as firm profitability. We
   use a rich dataset that combines sales, marketing mix, factor cost, and
   advertising cost data for eighteen geographic markets in the frozen
   entree category.
   We find that larger markets tend to be less price-sensitive and more
   profitable than smaller markets. We also find evidence of positive
   carryover of own advertising on own demand. In terms of consumer
   substitution patterns, we find that the role of advertising (in our
   data) seems to be more category-building (complementary) than
   share-stealing (competitive). The complementary role is stronger in
   larger markets. On the supply side, we find that firms make smaller
   adjustments to own advertising as goodwill goes up. Consistent with
   cross-advertising effects on demand, firms make smaller (larger)
   adjustments to advertising in response to competitive goodwill in the
   less competitive larger (in the more competitive smaller) markets.
   Finally, we find that consumer welfare decreases (increases) in larger
   (smaller) markets when firms move to a zero-advertising regime.

AB Normative models typically suggest that prices rise in periods of high
   demand and cost. However, in many markets, prices fall when demand or
   costs rise. This inconsistency occurs because the normative models
   assume that competitive intensity does not change with demand and cost
   conditions over time. We therefore introduce the notion of time-varying
   competition by suggesting that it is important not only to account for
   the direct effect of demand and cost on prices (e.g., higher demand
   means higher prices), but also the indirect effect of demand and cost
   changes on competition (e.g., higher demand could cause more competition
   and, hence, lower prices).
   We develop a general, unified framework to empirically model the direct
   and indirect effects of demand and cost shifts on pricing in
   differentiated product markets. Our approach allows us to measure the
   indirect effect of multiple demand and cost drivers on competitive
   intensity and test predictions from alternative theories of repeated
   games. The empirical application is to the U.S. photographic film
   industry, where there are two main players, Kodak and Fuji.
   We find that the indirect effects are highly significant and comparable
   in magnitude to the direct effects. Competitive intensity is greater in
   periods of high demand and lower cost and is moderated by whether demand
   or costs are expected to grow or decline. Interestingly, we find
   asymmetries in the competitive responses of Kodak and Fuji. While Kodak
   is sensitive to demand factors, Fuji is sensitive to costs. Our results
   suggest that market characteristics such as observability of competitor
   prices can be an important determinant of how competitive intensity is
   affected by demand and cost conditions.

AB I provide a general formulation of the channel pass-through problem as a
   comparative static of the retail price equilibrium, and I analyze the
   impact of category management and retail competition on pass-through,
   focusing on brand and retailer differences, and the nature of the cost
   change being passed through-whether it is brand specific, retailer
   specific, both, or neither.
   With category management, a retailer's response to a brand-specific cost
   change is not limited to that brand; in general, a retailer will also
   change the prices of other brands. The cross-brand effect can be
   positive or negative, and, depending on its sign, it either enhances or
   attenuates pass-through. I explain the cross-brand effect as an
   interaction between two forces: a demand-substitution force that pushes
   for a negative cross-brand effect, and a strategic-complementarity force
   that pushes for a positive cross-brand effect. Retail competition adds
   another layer of strategic complementarity, causing other retailers to
   respond even for retailer-specific cost changes and increasing
   pass-through of categorywide cost changes. But its effect for
   brand-specific cost changes is ambiguous.
   I apply the theory to two commonly used demand functions-linear demand
   and nested logit-and show that they have significantly different
   pass-through properties. The paper concludes with a discussion of how
   the theory relates to the empirical literature, including the companion
   piece by Besanko et al. (Besanko, D., J-P. Dube, S. Gupta. 2005.

AB In this paper we describe the pass-through behavior of a major U.S.
   supermarket chain for 78 products across 11 categories. Our data set
   includes retail prices and wholesale prices for stores in 15 retail
   price zones for a one-year period. For the empirical model, we use a
   reduced-form approach that focuses directly on equilibrium prices as a
   function of exogenous supply- and demand-shifting variables. The
   reduced-form approach enables us to identify the theoretical
   pass-through rate without specific assumptions about the form of
   consumer demand or the conduct of a category-pricing manager. Thus, our
   measurements of pass-through are not constrained by specific structure
   on the underlying economic model. The empirical pricing model includes
   costs of all competing products in the category on the right-hand side
   (not only the cost of the focal brand) and yields estimates of both
   own-brand and cross-brand pass-through rates.
   Our results provide a rich picture of the retailer's pass-through
   behavior. We find that pass-through varies substantially across products
   and across categories. Own-brand pass-through rates are, on average,
   more than 60 % for 9 of 11 categories, a finding that is at odds with
   the claims of manufacturers about retailers in general. Importantly, we
   find substantial evidence of cross-brand pass-through effects,
   indicating that retail prices of competing products are adjusted in
   response to a change in the wholesale price of any given product in the
   category. We find that cross-brand pass-through rates are both positive
   and negative. We explore determinants of own-brand and cross-brand
   pass-through rates and find strong evidence in multiple categories of
   asymmetric retailer response to trade promotions on large versus small
   brands. For example, brands with larger market shares, and brands that
   contribute more to retailer profits in the category, receive higher
   pass-through. We also find that trade promotions on large brands are
   less likely than small brands to generate positive cross-brand
   pass-through, i.e., induce the retailer to reduce the retail price of
   competing smaller products. On the other hand, small share brands are
   disadvantaged along three dimensions. Trade promotions on small brands
   receive low own-brand pass-through and generate positive cross-brand
   pass-through for larger competing brands. Moreover, small share brands
   do not receive positive cross pass-through from trade promotions on
   these larger competitors. We also find that store brands are similarly
   disadvantaged with respect to national brands.

AB Much of the empirical research on competitive reactions describes how or
   why rivals react to a firm's past actions, but stops short of examining
   whether managers attempt to predict such reactions, which we call
   strategic competitive reasoning. In three exploratory studies, we find
   evidence of managers' thinking about competitors' past and future
   behavior, but little incidence of strategic competitive reasoning.
   Competitive intelligence experts and other experienced managers'
   assessment of the results suggests that the relatively low incidence of
   strategic competitor reasoning is due to perceptions of low returns from
   anticipating competitor reactions more than to the high cost of doing
   so. Both the difficulty of obtaining competitive information and the
   uncertainty associated with predicting competitor behavior contribute to
   these perceptions. The paper suggests both a need for research on
   competitive behavior and an opportunity to influence and improve
   managerial judgment and decision making.

   new competitor's launch. The management problem addressed is to assess
   the market share impact of a new entrant in the residential Australian
   long distance telephone call market and determine the factors that would
   influence its dynamics and ultimate market appeal.
   The paper uses probability flow models to provide a framework to
   generate forecasts and assess the determinants of share loss. We develop
   models at two levels of complexity to give both simple, robust forecasts
   and more detailed diagnostic analysis of the effect of marketing
   actions. The models are calibrated prior to the new entrant's launch,
   enabling preemptive marketing strategies to be put in place by the
   defending company. The equilibrium level of consideration of the new
   entrant was driven by respondents' strength of relationship with the
   defender and inertia, while trial was more price-based. Continued use of
   the defender depends on both service factors and price. The rate at
   which share loss eventuates is negatively related to the defender's
   perceived responsiveness, saving money being the only reason to switch,
   and risk aversion.
   Prelaunch model forecasts, validated six months after launch using both
   aggregate monthly sales data and detailed tracking surveys, are shown to
   closely follow the actual evolution of the market. The paper provides a
   closed-form multistate model of the new entrant's diffusion, a
   methodology for the prelaunch calibration of dynamic models in practice,
   and insights into defensive strategies for existing companies facing new
   entrants.

AB Building on the observation that competitive dynamics and market
   evolution are inextricably linked and underresearched, we propose a road
   map to guide and stimulate future research in the area. A number of
   rationales have been proposed to explain why there is relatively little
   research directed toward understanding the links between competitive
   dynamics and market evolution; these include the predominance of
   different research paradigms in each area, a lack of data appropriate
   for analyzing the two areas together, and the difficulty of obtaining
   robust and significant results with analysis that is by definition
   complex (it must consider factors and outcomes both across firms and
   over time). Using this last rationale as a starting point, we develop a
   series of research propositions related to key relationships where (a)
   insignificant or contradictory results have been obtained (in extant
   research) or (b) researchers have yet to delve. The propositions are
   designed to deepen our understanding of the relationship between the
   areas. Throughout the analysis, the key to developing the propositions
   is to recognize the importance of moderating factors, mediating factors,
   and covariates. In addition, where the approach to empirically test a
   proposition is new, we propose categories, measures, and comparisons
   that can be used.

AB Despite some misconceptions, consumer rationality is a property of the
   researcher rather than the consumer. Consumers become more rational as
   we are better able to predict their behavior or other important outcomes
   influenced by their behavior. Perfect rationality results when we
   achieve accurate predictions. Consequently, at least for many Marketing
   Science articles, consumers are becoming more rational as we find better
   ways to predict. However, some experimental consumer behavior articles
   find the opposite. The difference between experimental and statistical
   controls explains the divergence in conclusions. Experimental controls
   test rationality based on whether previously absent variables exhibit
   significant explanatory power holding known explanatory variables
   constant. Statistical controls test rationality based on the incremental
   explanatory power of previously absent variables after accounting for
   known explanatory variables. Moreover, experimental tests tend to
   isolate consumer behavior predictions while statistical tests check for
   sufficient accuracy to choose among different firm strategies. Both
   perspectives are correct but ask very different questions.

AB This paper examines optimal advertised quality, actual quality, and
   price for a firm entering a market. It develops a two-period model where
   advertised quality influences expectations, and hence trial and the gap
   between actual quality and expectations determines satisfaction, which
   in turn impacts second-period sales. In such situations a company makes
   a choice between advertising high quality and getting trial, but little
   repeat; and advertising low quality and getting low trial, but high
   repeat.
   Results are derived by numerical methods, as well as analytically for a
   special case of the model. The model suggests it is optimal to overstate
   quality when (i) customers rely relatively less on advertising to form
   quality expectations, and (ii) customers' intrinsic satisfaction with a
   product is high.
   These results are consistent with deceptive advertising cases at the
   FTC, which showed more deception for unknown firms and for firms whose
   customers were more satisfied. They are also consistent with the
   decisions made by future managers (MBAs), except that the respondents
   would advertise higher (versus lower) quality when advertising was
   effective.

AB This paper considers the decision problem of a firm that is uncertain
   about the demand, and hence profitability, of a new product. We develop
   a model of a decision maker who sequentially learns about the true
   product profitability from observed product sales. Based on the current
   information, the decision maker decides whether to scrap the product.
   Central to this decision problem are sequential information gathering,
   and the option value of scrapping the product at any point in time. The
   model predicts the optimal demand for information (e.g., in the form of
   test marketing), and it predicts how the launch or exit policy depends
   on the firm's demand uncertainty. Furthermore, it predicts what fraction
   of newly developed products should be launched on average, and what
   fraction of these products will "fail," i.e., exit. The model is solved
   using numerical dynamic programming techniques. We present an
   application of the model to the case of the U.S. ready-to-eat breakfast
   cereal industry. Simulations show that the value of reducing uncertainty
   can be large, and that under higher uncertainty firms should strongly
   increase the fraction of all new product opportunities launched, even if
   their point estimate of profits is negative. Alternative, simpler
   decision rules are shown to lead to large profit losses compared to our
   method. Finally, we find that the high observed exit rate in the U.S.
   ready-to-eat cereal industry is optimal and to be expected based on our
   model.

AB Shipping-fee schedules are an important but underresearched element of
   the marketing mix for direct marketers. This paper provides an empirical
   study on the impact of shipping and handling charges on
   consumer-purchasing behavior. Using a database from an online retailer
   that has experimented with a wide variety of shipping-fee schedules, we
   investigate the impact of shipping charges on order incidence and order
   size. We use an ordered probability model that is generalized to account
   for the effects of nonlinear and discontinuous shipping fees on
   purchasing decisions, and to accommodate heterogeneity in response
   parameters. Results show that consumers are very sensitive to shipping
   charges and that shipping fees influence order incidence and basket
   size. Promotions such as free shipping and free shipping for orders that
   exceed some size threshold are found to be very effective in generating
   additional sales. However, the lost revenues from shipping and the lack
   of response by several segments are substantial enough to render such
   promotions unprofitable to the retailer. Heterogeneity across consumers
   also suggests interesting opportunities for the retailer to customize
   the shipping and other marketing-mix promotion offerings.

   mailing strategy allows for a broad set of objectives to be realized
   across the time horizon, such as profit maximization, customer
   retention, and utility maximization with or without risk aversion. We
   find that optimizing the objective function over multiple periods as

AB This paper investigates whether the tendency to buy store brand is
   category specific, or an enduring consumer trait. We develop a
   multicategory brand-choice model with a factor-analytic structure on the
   covariance matrix of the coefficients. The methodology allows us to
   elicit the basic latent tendency for a household to buy store brands,
   while controlling for other causes such as price sensitivity. The model
   is applied to a set of ten food and nonfood product categories. We find
   strong evidence of correlations in household preferences for store
   brands across categories. Using a two-dimensional factor structure, we
   find that one of the factors explains a substantial amount of variation
   in store-brand preference, while the other factor explains price
   sensitivity-consistently across categories. The presence of these
   factors in all categories indicates that there are unobservable
   household-level traits that are non-category specific, i.e., stable
   across product categories. Using data from five holdout categories, we
   find that household estimates of these latent factors are very useful in
   predicting demand for store brands in new categories. Other potential
   applications for store managers are discussed.

   paper, we take a different slant, showing that sometimes a separated
   channel that embodies a degree of discord can be helpful, particularly
   when a long-term view is taken. This result is shown in the context of
   durable goods manufacturing. The quandary of durable goods production is
   that once demand for a certain time frame is met, there is a subsequent
   temptation to flood the market with additional goods. As such, consumers
   are reluctant to buy immediately, instead opting to wait for discounted
   prices. This problem can be alleviated by a degree of channel discord:
   High wholesale prices ensure future sales will slow to a trickle.

   the allocation of channel profit. We find that the retailer is worse off
   because of its own or upstream personalized pricing, even when the

   retailer to embrace personalized pricing in order to reap the strategic
   benefit of deterring the manufacturer from selling direct and targeting

AB The case method of teaching and the corresponding Socratic Method
   predate the discovery of the scientific method for advancing knowledge
   and problem solving. The case method applies known principles (e.g.,
   laws) to specific situations while the scientific method focuses on
   discovering principles. Although the case method might be effective at
   teaching leadership and persuasion skills, it can lack the spirit of
   inquiry and the worship of the truth associated with the scientific
   method. Moreover, unlike legal cases, business cases lack precedent
   (i.e., stare decisis), the foundation of written law, and rigorous
   adjudication. More importantly, the traditional case method of teaching
   often ignores important research findings. Consequently, it helps
   destroy the link between academic research and classroom learning.
   Students lose the benefit of important research findings while leaving
   the classroom with false confidence about what they know. Researchers
   lose an incentive to do research relevant to their students. Eventually,
   there is less research worth teaching, and fewer students value the
   knowledge learned through painstaking research. Although we might covet
   the skill of persuasion, time might gradually elevate previously less
   persuasive managers who have better skills with analysis and collecting
   relevant information. Great teaching requires great content, in addition
   to active learning.

AB When purchase and consumption decisions are separated in time and when
   future utility is state dependent, consumers may desire to pursue
   consumption flexibility by purchasing different products together
   (multiple buying). This paper analyzes the effects of consumption
   flexibility on competing firms' marketing mix decisions, in a model in
   which future preference uncertainty exists and consumers differ in their
   preferred product location on a horizontal attribute. The analysis shows
   that the nature of price competition in such markets is dependent upon
   whether consumer multiple buying (and thus primary demand) is
   endogenously induced. When preference uncertainty is important, the
   firms are involved in a "flexibility trap" in which primary demand is
   expanded but profits decrease with the spread of consumer heterogeneity.
   This counter-intuitive result is caused by the firms being induced to
   over-cut prices to increase primary demand when consumption flexibility
   is important. In response to this, the firms may configure their
   products to alleviate the adverse effect of consumer heterogeneity. For
   example, if preference uncertainty is important, the firms may choose to
   minimize differentiation on the horizontal attribute, or extend the
   current product line, to deal with the "flexibility trap." The
   implications of allowing for positive salvage value, uncertainty
   heterogeneity, preference correlation, and state-dependent preference
   configuration are also investigated.

AB Asymmetric pricing or asymmetric price adjustment is the phenomenon
   where prices rise more readily than they fall. We offer and provide
   empirical support for a new theory of asymmetric pricing in wholesale
   prices. Wholesale prices may adjust asymmetrically in the small but
   symmetrically in the large, when retailers face cost of price
   adjustment. Such retailers will not adjust prices for small changes in
   their costs. Manufacturers then see a region of inelastic demand where
   small wholesale price changes do not translate into commensurate retail
   price changes. The implication is asymmetric-a small wholesale price
   increase is more profitable because manufacturers will not lose
   customers from higher retail prices; yet, a small decrease is less
   profitable, because it will not lower retail prices; hence, there is no
   extra revenue from greater sales. For larger changes, this asymmetry in
   the behavior of wholesale price vanishes as the price adjustment cost is
   compensated by the increase in retailers' revenue resulting from
   correspondingly large retail price changes. We present a formal economic
   model of a channel with forward-looking retailers and cost of price
   adjustment, test the derived propositions on the behavior of
   manufacturer prices using a large supermarket scanner data set, and find
   that the results are consistent with the predictions of our theory. We
   then discuss the implications for asymmetric pricing, channels, and cost
   of price adjustment literatures, as well as public policy.

AB Chat rooms, recommendation sites, and customer review sections allow
   consumers to overcome geographic boundaries and to communicate based on
   mutual interests. However, marketers also have incentives to supply
   promotional chat or reviews in order to influence the consumers'
   evaluation of their products. Moreover, firms can disguise their
   promotion as consumer recommendations due to the anonymity afforded by
   online communities. We explore this new setting where advertising and
   word of mouth become perfect substitutes because they appear
   indistinguishable to the consumer. Specifically, we investigate here
   whether word of mouth remains credible and whether firms choose to
   devote more resources promoting their inferior or superior products. We
   develop a game theoretic model in which two products are differentiated
   in their value to the consumer. Unlike the firms, the consumers are
   uncertain about the products' quality. The consumers read messages
   online that help them decide on the identity of the superior product. We
   find a unique equilibrium where online word of mouth is persuasive
   despite the promotional chat activity by competing firms. In this
   equilibrium, firms spend more resources promoting inferior products, in
   striking contrast to existing advertising literature. In addition, we
   discuss consumer welfare implications and how other marketing strategies
   might interact with promotional chat.

AB Firms often differentiate their product lines vertically to capture
   consumers' differential willingness to pay for quality. Additionally,
   many firms offer products varying not in quality but in characteristics
   such as scent, color, or flavor, that relate to horizontal
   differentiation. For example, in the yogurt category, each manufacturer
   carries several product lines differing in quality and price, but within
   each line there is an assortment of flavors that is uniformly priced.
   To better understand these product-tine pricing strategies, we address
   two key issues. First, how do consumers perceive product-line and flavor
   attributes? Second, given consumers' preferences, is the current
   strategy of pricing product lines differently, but offering all flavors
   within a product line at the same price, optimal?
   We find that consumers value line attributes more than flavor
   attributes. Our analysis reveals that firms exploit these differences in
   consumer preferences by using product lines as a price discrimination
   tool. However, firms' profits would not significantly increase if they
   were to price flavors within a product line differently. Therefore, the
   current pricing policy of setting different prices for product lines,
   but uniform prices for all flavors within a line, appears to be on
   target.

AB How can supermarkets use the vast data they have to design strategies to
   compete for large-basket shoppers, potentially their most profitable
   customers? We say, analyze the data to glean basket composition of
   heterogeneous consumers. Of theoretical and practical interest is the
   question, will our suggestion improve supermarket profits, and if so, by
   what pricing strategies? By answering this we can also answer the
   question, do results of extant research on single-product marketing that
   using such information intensifies competition and lowers profits,
   generalize to multiproduct marketing by supermarkets that carry several
   products, and whose patrons purchase multiple items? We derive
   equilibrium data-based intelligent pricing strategies that also produce
   increased supermarket profits. What is more interesting is our result
   that data analysis is profitable whether or not a competitor undertakes
   data analysis. If not too costly, implementing data analysis is a
   dominant strategy. Moreover, with comprehensive data analysis connecting
   basket information and household data, stores can increase profits

AB One research function is proposing new scientific theories; another is
   testing the falsifiable predictions of those theories. Eventually,
   sufficient observations reveal valid predictions. For the impatient,
   behold statistical methods, which attribute inconsistent predictions to
   either faulty data (e.g., measurement error) or faulty theories.
   Testing theories, however, differs from estimating unknown parameters in
   known relationships. When testing theories, it is sufficiently dangerous
   to cure inconsistencies by adding observed explanatory variables (i.e.,
   beyond the theory), let alone unobserved explanatory variables. Adding
   ad hoc explanatory variables mimics experimental controls when
   experiments are impractical. Assuming unobservable variables is
   different, partly because realizations of unobserved variables are
   unavailable for validating estimates.
   When different statistical assumptions about error produce dramatically
   different conclusions, we should doubt the theory, the data, or both.
   Theory tests should be insensitive to assumptions about error,
   particularly adjustments for error from unobserved variables. These
   adjustments can fallaciously inflate support for wrong theories, partly
   by implicitly under-weighting observations inconsistent with the theory.
   Inconsistent estimates often convey an important message-the data are
   inconsistent with the theory! Although adjustments for unobserved
   variables and ex post information are extraordinarily useful when
   estimating known relationships, when testing theories, requiring
   researchers to make these adjustments is inappropriate.

AB The abundance of highly disaggregate data (e.g., at five-second
   intervals) raises the question of the optimal data interval to estimate
   advertising carryover. The literature assumes that (1) the optimal data
   interval is the interpurchase time, (2) too disaggregate data causes a
   disaggregation bias, and (3) recovery of true parameters requires
   assumption of the underlying advertising process. In contrast, we show
   that (1) the optimal data interval is what we call unit exposure time,
   (2) too disaggregate data does not cause any disaggregation bias, and
   (3) recovery of true parameters does not require assumption of the
   advertising process but only data at the unit exposure time. These
   results hold for any linear dynamic model linking sales with current and
   past advertising.

   fully reflected in customer perceptions of quality until after about six
   years. In the first year after a quality change, only about 20% of the
   total effect over time is realized. These effects are significantly
   larger and quicker for a decrease in quality relative to an equivalent
   increase. Interestingly, we also find that brand reputation has a
   "double" advantage. High-reputation brands are rewarded three years
   quicker for an increase in quality and punished one year slower for a
   decrease in quality compared to low-reputation brands. These differences
   in response time are a meaningful measure of brand equity. Finally, we

AB In a model of vertical differentiation, the principal concern of this
   paper is to identify sufficient conditions for producing a higher- or
   lower-quality good to be more profitable (in terms of profits and profit
   margin). Our basic model considers a short-run scenario where the firms'
   quality levels are fixed and they engage in price competition. Here, our
   results are three. First, we develop the notion of relative cost
   efficiency and show that its (increasing or decreasing) monotonicity in
   product quality implies that of firm profitability in equilibrium. A
   firm's relative cost efficiency refers to its quality-adjusted cost
   (dis)advantage relative to its immediate competitors, for a given
   distribution of consumer tastes. Second, selling a higher-quality good
   is more profitable when absolute cost efficiency (defined as the ratio
   between a firm's quality and unit cost) is increasing in quality. Third,
   we also establish a set of lower and upper bounds on each firm's
   profitability.
   The basic model is then extended in two directions. We examine unit cost
   functions that demonstrate monotone profitability, even when both
   quality and price are endogenous variables. We also show that the spirit
   of relative cost efficiency and its associated sufficient condition hold
   valid for a logconcave consumer distribution.

AB W e extend the Schmittlein et al. model (1987) of customer lifetime
   value to include satisfaction. Customer purchases are modeled as Poisson
   events, and their rates of occurrence depend on the satisfaction of the
   most recent purchase encounter. Customers purchase at a higher rate when
   they are satisfied than when they are dissatisfied. A closed-form
   formula is derived for predicting total expected dollar spending from a
   customer base over a time period (0, T]. This formula reveals that
   approximating the mixture arrival processes by a single aggregate
   Poisson process can systematically underestimate the total number of
   purchases and revenue.
   Interestingly, the total revenue is increasing and convex in
   satisfaction. If the cost is sufficiently convex, our model reveals that
   the aggregate model leads to an overinvestment in customer satisfaction.
   The model is further extended to include three other benefits of
   customer satisfaction: (1) satisfied customers are likely to spend more
   per trip on average than dissatisfied customers, (2) satisfied customers
   are less likely to leave the customer base than dissatisfied customers,
   and (3) previously satisfied customers can be more (or less) likely to
   be satisfied in the current visit than previously dissatisfied
   customers. We show that all the main results carry through to these
   general settings.

AB T he marketing literature has suggested two prominent decision
   mechanisms through which in-store display and feature advertising can
   affect brand choice, which I call the price-cut proxy effect and the
   consideration set formation effect. The primary objective of this study
   is to propose an integrated brand choice model that incorporates these
   two possible behavioral mechanisms, which have been shown to work by
   previous research. The model allows consumers to use various
   combinations of the decision mechanisms with different probabilities and
   thus enables one to jointly assess the extent to which each effect might
   occur in actual purchase data and to investigate how consumers might
   differ in their tendencies to engage in these decision processes. By
   incorporating these likely behavioral mechanisms, the proposed model
   alleviates the problems caused by multicollinearity and produces
   sensible parameter estimates for the joint effects of promotion vehicles
   (in-store display, feature ad, and price discount), which contributes to
   better managerial decision making.

AB This study investigates how people's satisfaction judgments are modified
   after they interact with other group members. It integrates research on
   customer satisfaction and social influence to develop hypotheses about
   how an individual's satisfaction is influenced by discrepancies between
   her expectations about the satisfaction of other group members and their
   actual opinions as revealed in group discussion. It also considers how
   this effect is moderated by the individual's susceptibility to social
   influence and perceptions of group cohesiveness. Two empirical studies
   demonstrate significant social influence effects on satisfaction
   judgments in groups. Study One analyzes group satisfaction data
   collected over time using a mixed-effects regression. It shows that an
   individual's perceived discrepancy between others' satisfaction
   judgments and expected group satisfaction has an important influence on
   her postdiscussion satisfaction judgments. Moreover, individuals
   discount the prediscussion satisfaction judgments of other group members
   in favor of perceived satisfaction and its discrepancy with
   expectations. Group cohesiveness accentuates the perceived discrepancy
   with expected group satisfaction. Study Two analyzes survey data from
   dyads drawn from a cross-sectional sample of organizational buyers who
   purchase from the same supplier. It models the decision maker's
   satisfaction with a service supplier as a function of end-user
   satisfaction. It shows that social influence effects exist in purchasing
   groups within organizations. Both studies demonstrate that
   individual-level postdiscussion satisfaction judgments tend to become
   more extreme, a phenomenon we call satisfaction escalation.

AB This paper extends the scanner-based choice literature by explicitly
   incorporating individual-level brand-preference data. We illustrate our
   model using a unique data set that combines survey and scanner data
   collected from the same individuals.
   The addition of individual-specific brand-preference information
   significantly improves fit and prediction. Furthermore, this "observed"
   heterogeneity better explains choice than does "unobserved"
   heterogeneity in the standard scanner model's parameters. More
   importantly, we find that the standard model underestimates the
   importance of consumers' brand preferences and overestimates both brand
   loyalties and price sensitivities. Brand loyalty is overestimated
   because models without preference information confound state dependence,
   heterogeneity, and preference effects. Price sensitivities are inflated
   because the "average" preference-based consumer is implicitly assumed to
   be more willing to switch from his preferred brand than is the "real"
   preference-based consumer. Further, standard models overestimate the
   heterogeneity in price and loyalty sensitivities and misidentify both
   price- and loyalty-sensitive consumers.
   The managerial implications of our findings and the applicability of our
   methodology when survey data are collected infrequently and for only a
   subsample of consumers are pursued. We demonstrate that even under these
   circumstances better populationwide pricing and promotion decisions are
   identified and more accurate targeting results.

AB When making product choices, consumers are influenced by the preferences
   of other consumers, such as family members, friends, neighbors, and
   colleagues. Preference interdependence among family members is likely to
   be significant because of cohabitation and strong emotional ties. To
   estimate the preference interdependence, we specify a simultaneous
   equation model and propose a Bayesian estimation approach. Unlike
   existing models that use a spatial autoregressive structure to capture
   the interdependence of consumer preferences, we are able to estimate the
   potential asymmetry in the preference interdependence among family
   members in a more flexible way. In a simulation study, we show that
   models that ignore interdependence of preferences yield biased estimates
   of consumers' sensitivity to observed attribute preferences. In an
   empirical application, we estimate the interdependence of the viewership
   of television programs between husbands and wives in 481 households. We
   find that wives' viewing behavior depends more strongly on their
   husbands' viewing behavior than husbands' viewing behavior depends on
   their wives' viewing behavior. There exist significant differences in
   parameter estimates of dependence across categories of television
   programs. Differences in levels of spousal interdependence across
   households are partially explained by the age and the education level of
   the spouses.

   as a car, the market value of their current (used) durable is less than
   the outstanding loan amount. If these consumers want to replace their
   used durable with a new one, they might not be able to do so because of
   the added burden of paying off the amount of negative equity. We develop
   and solve a model in which a durable goods manufacturer gives consumers
   a cash rebate, so that they can get out of the negative equity problem.
   We find that under certain conditions, the manufacturer offering a lower
   durability product is more likely to give cash rebates and, when such
   rebates are given, to offer a greater cash rebate. These rebates also
   lead to higher prices net of the rebate compared with the situation
   without any such rebates. We empirically test some of our equilibrium

   structure choose their agents. A theoretical section specifies the
   firm's decision process in obtaining the creative and media components.
   Conditions under which one or both could be effectively produced
   internally are identified. In the prevalent case when these components,

   produced by a bundled full-service agency or by unbundling to separate
   agents. An empirical section tests the theory implications with

   bundled full-service agency is still widely used. Firms with large
   advertising budgets unbundle to take advantage of media discounts
   obtained by market-making media shops. Internal agencies are used when
   firms have internal creative abilities, or have low-level requirements
   in both creative and media. The creative and media agencies within

   This fact is particularly egregious because unlike other groups that can

   Although the U.S. Constitution never mentions commercial speech, the
   courts invented the concept to censor marketing folks. The cloudy
   rational was that consumers need special protection from marketing folks
   (e.g., advertising). Naturally, censorship leads to abuse. Powerful

AB Idea generation (ideation) is critical to the design and marketing of
   new products, to marketing strategy, and to the creation of effective
   advertising copy. However, there has been relatively little formal
   research on the underlying incentives with which to encourage
   participants to focus their energies on relevant and novel ideas.
   Several problems have been identified with traditional ideation methods.
   For example, participants often free ride on other participants' efforts
   because rewards are typically based on the group-level output of
   ideation sessions.
   This paper examines whether carefully tailored ideation incentives can
   improve creative output. I begin by studying the influence of incentives
   on idea generation using a formal model of the ideation process. This
   model illustrates the effect of rewarding participants for their impact
   on the group and identifies a parameter that mediates this effect. I
   then develop a practical, web-based asynchronous "ideation game," which
   allows the implementation and test of various incentive schemes. Using
   this system, I run two experiments that demonstrate that incentives do
   have the capability to improve idea generation, confirm the predictions
   from the theoretical analysis, and provide additional insight on the
   mechanisms of ideation.

   advocated a number of different customer feedback metrics including
   average customer satisfaction scores and the number of "net promoters"
   among a firm's customers. We empirically examine which commonly used and
   widely advocated customer feedback metrics are most valuable in
   predicting future business performance. Using American Customer
   Satisfaction Index data, we assess the linkages between six different
   satisfaction and loyalty metrics and COMPUSTAT and CRSP data-based
   measures of different dimensions of firms' business performance over the
   period 1994-2000. Our results indicate that average satisfaction scores
   have the greatest value in predicting future business performance and
   that Top 2 Box satisfaction scores also have good predictive value. We
   also find that while repurchase likelihood and proportion of customers
   complaining have some predictive value depending on the specific
   dimension of business performance, metrics based on recommendation
   intentions (net promoters) and behavior (average number of
   recommendations) have little or no predictive value. Our results clearly
   indicate that recent prescriptions to focus customer feedback systems

   as the influence of the dynamics in its intrinsic preference on that

   preferences of models offered by a particular brand, we use a nested
   logit model with the brand (e.g., Sony) at the upper level and its
   various models (e.g., Mavica, FD, DSC, etc.) at the lower level of the
   nest. Relative model preferences are captured via their attributes and
   prices. We allow for heterogeneity across consumers in their preferences
   for these attributes and in their price sensitivities in addition to
   heterogeneity in consumers' intrinsic brand preferences. Together with
   the nested logit assumption, this allows for a flexible substitution
   pattern across models at the aggregate level. The attractiveness of a
   brand's product line changes over time with entry and exit of new models
   and with changes in attribute and price levels. To allow for
   time-varying intrinsic brand preferences, we use a state-space model
   based on the Kalman filter, which captures the influence of marketing
   actions such as brand-level advertising on the dynamics of intrinsic
   brand preferences. Hence, the proposed model accounts for the effects of
   brand preferences, model attributes and marketing mix variables on
   consumer choice. First, we carry out a simulation study to ensure that
   our estimation procedure is able to recover the true parameters
   generating the data. Then, we estimate our model parameters on data for
   the U.S. digital camera market. Overall, we find that the effect of
   dynamics in the intrinsic brand preference is greater than the
   corresponding effect of the dynamics in the brand's product line
   attractiveness. Assuming plausible profit margins, we evaluate the
   effect of increasing the advertising expenditures for the largest and
   the smallest brands in this category and find that these brands can
   increase their profitability by increasing their advertising
   expenditures. We also analyze the impact of modifying a camera model's
   attributes on its profits. Such an analysis could potentially be used to
   evaluate if product development efforts would be profitable.

AB This paper provides an empirical study of entry by a Wal-Mart
   supercenter into a local market. Using a unique frequent-shopper
   database that records transactions for over 10,000 customers, we study
   the impact of Wal-Mart's entry on consumer purchase behavior. We develop
   a joint model of interpurchase time and basket size to study the impact
   of competitor entry on two key household decisions: store visits and
   in-store expenditures. The model also allows for consumer heterogeneity
   due to observed and unobserved factors. Results show that the incumbent
   supermarket lost 17% volume-amounting to a quarter million dollars in
   monthly revenue-following Wal-Mart's entry. Decomposing the lost sales
   into components attributed to store visits and in-store expenditures, we
   find that the majority of these losses were due to fewer store visits
   with a much smaller impact attributed to basket size. We also find that
   Wal-Mart lures some of the incumbent's best customers, and that
   retention of a small number of households can significantly reduce
   losses at the focal store. Finally, certain observed household
   characteristics such as distance to store, shopping behavior, and
   product purchase behavior are found to be useful in profiling the
   defectors to Wal-Mart. Implications and strategies for supermarket
   managers to compete with Wal-Mart are discussed.

AB Firms invest heavily in different types of business-to-business
   relationship marketing activities in the belief that such programs
   bolster their bottom line. In this study, we develop and test a
   conceptual model that links customer-specific relationship marketing
   investments to short-term, customer-specific financial outcomes. Data
   from a matched set of 313 business customers covered by 143 salespeople
   of 34 selling firms indicate that investments in social relationship
   marketing pay off handsomely, financial relationship marketing
   investments do not, and structural relationship marketing investments
   are economically viable for customers serviced frequently. We
   conceptualize relationship marketing in a context involving nested
   participants (customers, salespeople, selling firms) and employ a
   hierarchical linear modeling approach to account for observations that
   are not independent. Across the three hierarchical levels, the impact of
   the financial, social, and structural components of relationship
   marketing investments and the potential moderating factors offer
   valuable insights into contextual factors and managerial strategies for
   leveraging relationship marketing investments. In an attempt to suggest
   normative guidelines to managers, we extend our analysis to a simple
   resource allocation model that describes the optimal mix of relationship
   marketing resources based on firm strategies.

AB Consumer choice in surveys and in the marketplace reflects a complex
   process of screening and evaluating choice alternatives. Behavioral and
   economic models of choice processes are difficult to estimate when using
   stated and revealed preferences because the underlying process is
   latent. This paper introduces Bayesian methods for estimating two
   behavioral models that eliminate alternatives using specific attribute
   levels. The elimination by aspects theory postulates a sequential
   elimination of alternatives by attribute levels until a single one, the
   chosen alternative, remains. In the economic screening rule model,
   respondents screen out alternatives with certain attribute levels and
   then choose from the remaining alternatives, using a compensatory
   function of all the attributes. The economic screening rule model gives
   an economic justification as to why certain attributes are used to
   screen alternatives. A commercial conjoint study is used to illustrate
   the methods and assess their performance. In this data set, the economic
   screening rule model outperforms the EBA and other standard choice
   models and provides comparable results to an equivalent conjunctive
   screening rule model.

AB he rapid rate of knowledge obsolescence in many high-technology markets
   makes it imperative for firms to renew their technological bases
   constantly. Given its critical importance, excellence in renewal of
   technological base would serve as a dynamic capability. Drawing on past
   literature, we identify this dynamic capability associated with
   acquiring and utilizing external technological know-how with the notion
   of absorptive capacity (AC).
   We ask the following questions: (a) What would cause some firms to have
   a higher AC than others? and, (b) What is the impact of AC on a firm's
   profitability?
   We build a conceptual framework suggesting that marketing, R&D, and
   operations capabilities have a significant positive impact on a firm's
   AC. We test our framework on a data set of firms in high-technology
   markets. Using an econometric technique called stochastic frontier
   estimation, we infer the AC of firms from an observation of the know-how
   they actually absorb. We find that firm-specific capabilities
   significantly impact AC. Also, we find that AC has a significant impact
   on profitability and that this impact is moderated by the pace of
   technological change: the greater the pace of change, the greater the
   impact.

AB In this study, we examine firms' incentive to offer customized products
   in addition to their standard products in a competitive environment. We
   offer several key insights. First, we delineate market conditions in
   which firms will (will not) offer customized products in addition to
   their standard products. Surprisingly, we find that when firms offer
   customized products they are able to not only expand demand, but can
   also increase the prices of their standard products relative to when
   they do not. Second, we find that when a firm offers customized products
   it is a dominant strategy for it to also offer its standard product.
   This result highlights the role of standard products and the importance
   of retaining them when firms offer customized products. Third, we
   identify market conditions under which ex ante symmetric firms will
   adopt symmetric or asymmetric custornization strategies. Fourth, we
   highlight how the degree of customization offered in equilibrium is
   affected by market parameters. We find that the degree of custornization
   is lower when both firms offer customized products relative to the case
   when only one firm offers customized products. Finally, we show that
   customizing products under competition does not lead to a prisoner's
   dilemma.

   broadcasters seek to gain viewers by choosing the type of program to
   offer and by spending money to set program quality, allowing
   broadcasters to sell access to those viewers (through inserted

   between our analysis and that of Wu and Chou. While we had intended to
   rule out this strategy, the text was not entirely clear on this issue;
   Wu and Chou's comment provides an opportunity to clarify the situation.
   We provide both empirical and theoretical support for excluding this

   situations in television broadcasting. We also reply to Wu and Chou's
   other comments on several issues, such as the relative importance of
   program type versus quality.

AB Given the growth of the service sector, and advances in information
   technology and communications that facilitate the management of
   relationships with customers, models of service and relationships are a
   fast-growing area of marketing science. This article summarizes existing
   work in this area and identifies promising topics for future research.
   Models of service and relationships can help managers manage service
   more efficiently, customize service more effectively, manage customer
   satisfaction and relationships, and model the financial impact of those
   customer relationships. Models for managing service have often
   emphasized analytical approaches to pricing, but emerging issues such as
   the trade-off between privacy and customization are attracting
   increasing attention. The trade-offs between productivity and
   customization have also been addressed by both analytical and empirical
   models, but future research in the area of service customization will
   likely place increased emphasis on e-service and truly personalized
   interactions. Relationship models will focus less on models of customer
   expectations and length of relationship, and more on modeling the
   effects of dynamic marketing interventions with individual customers.
   The nature of service relationships increasingly leads to financial
   impact being assessed within customer and across product, rather than
   the traditional reverse, suggesting the increasing importance of
   analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) and managing the firm's customer
   equity.

AB The recent marketing literature reflects a growing interest in
   structural models, stemming from (1) the desire to test a variety of
   behavioral theories with market data, and (2) recent developments that
   facilitate estimation of and inference for these models. Whether one
   should always go through the effort of developing such tightly
   parameterized models with the associated computational burden of
   estimating them and whether it pays off to make strict behavioral
   assumptions in terms of better decisions remain open questions. To shed
   some light on these issues, we provide examples of structural approaches
   to consumer choice and demand as well as examples where the goal is to
   study the nature of competition in the marketplace. From that review
   comes our discussion of issues in the development and application of
   structural models, including their estimation, testing, and validation,
   their applicability in the practice of marketing, and their usefulness
   for normative as well as descriptive purposes.

AB Structural models integrate behavioral and psychological decision theory
   into economics models and are more aligned with the true underlying
   economic primitives of the consumers. This allows researchers to
   investigate more behavior-driven and process-oriented customer decision
   processes such as learning of product attributes, formation of a
   consideration sets, stockpiling, and flexible consumption that cannot be
   easily handled by traditional marketing models. Chintagunta et a].
   (2006) gives an excellent review on the development and applications of
   structural models in marketing for modeling both consumer demand and
   firm competition.
   Recent interests in consumer research have diversified from frequently
   purchased packaged goods to services, high-tech, Internet, and
   information industries. Consumers are observed to be more sophisticated,
   long-term oriented, risk averse, and rational when making purchase and
   consumption decisions in these product categories. Structural models are
   better choices to capture the nature of the sophisticated decision
   process under the new marketing environment and engineering. Given the
   thorough review of Chintagunta et al. (2006), 1 will focus only on the
   dynamic structural demand models that have the components of information
   processing, rational expectation, and/or endogenous decisions to trade
   off current and future utilities, and I discuss some current marketing
   issues that can be most appropriately addressed by these models.

   different issues related to the use of structural models in marketing.
   They use examples of structural models that involve both consumer demand
   and supply-side competition to provide a critical assessment of the
   strengths and weaknesses of structural modeling and its future in
   marketing. While they have done a very nice job, the purpose of this

AB The motion picture industry has provided a fruitful research domain for
   scholars in marketing and other disciplines. The industry has high
   economic importance and is appealing to researchers because it offers
   both rich data that cover the entire product lifecycle for many new
   products and because it provides many unsolved "puzzles." Although the
   amount of scholarly research in this area is rapidly growing, its impact
   on practice has not been as significant as in other industries (e.g.,
   consumer packaged goods). In this article, we discuss critical practical
   issues for the motion picture industry, review existing knowledge on
   those issues, and outline promising research directions. Our review is
   organized around the three key stages in the value chain for theatrical
   motion pictures: production, distribution, and exhibition. Focusing on
   what we believe are critical managerial issues, we propose various
   conjectures-framed either as research challenges or specific research
   hypotheses-related to each stage in the value chain and often involved
   in understanding consumer movie-going behavior.

   challenges for managers are the need to (1) view movies as just one part
   of the product line, (2) consider the evolution of the first-run
   exhibition channel, and (3) take a global perspective in decision
   making. For researchers, the motion picture industry is a data-intensive
   natural laboratory that allows for empirical testing of important
   research questions. The study of competitive dynamics and contractual
   issues are highlighted as topics of particular relevance.

AB We observe a disproportional number of movies that vividly portray
   business and businesspeople with an unfavorable bias, often depicting
   ordinary business activity as zero-sum and sometimes depicting it as
   callous, immoral, and criminal. These movies also often aggrevate
   existing economic misconceptions that might include what we could call
   folk marketing. Folk marketing includes false ideas, such as marketing
   being a zero-sum game (rather than adding value), marketing research
   being intrusive clandestine surveillance (rather than advocating the buy
   viewpoint), and secrecy about market data being evidence of nefarious
   activities (rather than simply hiding strategies from competitors).
   Marketing scholars need to combat vigorously these false ideas.
   Moreover, when advertisements sponsor movies, it might be necessary to
   consider the conjoined movie content and the consistency of that content
   with the desired brand image.

   today. It has been studied in many independent research traditions. Our
   understanding and study of innovation can benefit from an integrative
   review of these research traditions. In so doing, we identify 16 topics
   relevant to marketing science, which we classify under five research
   fields:
   Consumer response to innovation, including attempts to measure consumer
   imovativeness, models of new product growth, and recent ideas on network
   externalities;
   Organizations and innovation, which are increasingly important as
   product development becomes more complex and tools more effective but
   demanding;
   Market entry strategies, which includes recent research on technology
   revolution, extensive marketing science research on strategies for
   entry, and issues of portfolio management;
   Prescriptive techniques for product development processes, which have
   been transformed through global pressures, increasingly accurate
   customer input, Web-based communication for dispersed and global product
   design, and new tools for dealing with complexity over time and across
   product lines;
   Defending against market entry and capturing the rewards of innovating,
   which includes extensive marketing science research on strategies of
   defense, managing through metrics, and rewards to entrants.
   For each topic, we summarize key concepts and highlight research
   challenges. For prescriptive research topics, we also review current
   thinking and applications. For descriptive topics, we review key
   findings.

   unobservable or perceptual customer metrics (e.g., customer
   satisfaction) and observable or behavioral metrics (e.g., customer
   retention and lifetime value). We begin with an overview of unobservable
   and observable metrics, showing how they have been measured and modeled
   in research. We next offer nine empirical generalizations about the

   some of the influential work in the branding area, highlighting what has
   been learned from an academic perspective on important topics such as
   brand positioning, brand integration, brand-equity measurement, brand
   growth, and brand management. The paper also outlines some gaps that
   exist in the research of branding and brand equity and formulates a

AB Questionable methods for increasing nominal wages reduce real wages
   (i.e., buying power) by creating inflation, shortages, lower quality,
   and long-term unemployment. To increase real wages (i.e., the ability to
   buy more), economic principles prescribe increasing productivity (i.e.,
   greater output from less input). In contrast, marketing principles
   prescribes increasing the value of output (i.e., greater customer
   benefits) through innovation. Beyond increasing real wages, innovation
   spawns new occupations better matching individuals with skills and
   providing greater nonmonetary benefits (i.e., job satisfaction).
   Unfortunately, threatened entrenched incumbents often solicit
   protectionist legislation claiming negative externalities (e.g.,
   short-term unemployment, lower wages, and burdens on society).
   Innovation does require labor to move from inferior to superior
   organizations (i.e., unemployment). However, protectionism only delays
   and dramatically aggravates the inevitable trauma associated with
   progress, as worker skills, firm practices, and buyer welfare fall
   further behind. Recent attacks demonizing Wal-Mart (e.g., the dubious
   Vlasic pickle claim) epitomize this situation-they are archaic vanilla
   protectionism, menacing both imperiled consumers and every
   consumer-driven business.

AB This paper explores the benefits of letting customers escape from
   prepurchased service contracts by offering refunds for cancellations. We
   show that such a policy creates opportunities for multiple selling in a
   capacity-constrained service-i.e., collecting cancellation fees from
   advance buyers who cancel, and then reselling the freed slots. The
   better the alternative that motivates a cancellation, the more
   profitable is a refund-for-cancellations policy compared with a
   no-refund policy that "locks in" customers. In contrast to previous
   research on money-back guarantees for durable goods, we show that
   offering refunds for service cancellations can be profitable (1) without
   charging a higher price compared with a no-refund policy, and (2) even
   when advance buyers would be willing to abandon the service for no
   refund. Also, service providers should decrease rather than increase the
   customer hassle cost of cancellations. Our research also suggests a new
   profit advantage of advance selling, i.e., capturing some of the
   consumer-added surplus created when customers find new alternatives (and
   are therefore willing to pay a fee to terminate the prepurchased
   contract). Finally, yield-management research typically assumes
   exogenous "no shows" by advance buyers. We suggest that offering refunds
   for cancellation reduces the need to reserve capacity for high-paying
   customers and improves capacity

AB W e study a channel relationship in which manufacturer(s) use
   independent sales representatives (rep firms), which employ salespeople
   to do the actual selling. We show that commission-only payments by
   manufacturers to rep firms lead to suboptimal outcomes for the
   manufacturer relative to those obtained under a vertically integrated
   channel. From the manufacturer's standpoint, these inefficiencies can be
   ameliorated through the use of sales incentives given to the rep firm's
   salespeople directly by the manufacturer (called "spiffs"). In a
   monopolistic environment, spiffs are shown to improve the manufacturer's
   profits in the face of contractual restrictions on the channel members'
   ability to set separate commission rates by product. For certain types
   of restrictions, spiffs may generate manufacturer outcomes close to the
   fully coordinated ones achieved under vertical integration even when
   compensating the rep firm through commission-only contracts. In a
   competitive environment, spiffs are shown to be used by a powerful
   manufacturer that shares a rep firm's sales efforts with the product of
   a weaker manufacturer (i.e., in the case of "common agency"). In this
   case, spiffs are used as a strategy to deter the weaker manufacturer
   from challenging the stronger manufacturer for the salesforce's valuable
   selling effort.

AB A cross-market network effect exists in many industries (e.g., newspaper
   publishing, media, software) in which a seller sells both a primary and
   a secondary product (e.g., a newspaper publisher sells newspapers to
   readers and advertising space to advertisers), and the value of the
   secondary product depends on the size of the user base of the primary
   product. This paper examines the competitive implications of asymmetric
   customer loyalty in such markets. In traditional markets, an advantage
   in customer loyalty generates a profit advantage. We show here, however,
   that in the presence of a cross-market network effect, a midlevel of
   loyalty advantage in the primary product market can lead to an overall
   profit disadvantage. This surprising result is derived from the
   interdependence of the two markets, whereby a profit in one market may
   be gained at the cost of the other, and by the positive relationship
   between a larger loyalty segment and a higher opportunity cost of price
   competition in the product of the primary market. Extending our model to
   a two-period entry game also shows that under certain conditions, the
   entrant with disadvantage in customer loyalty can outperform the
   incumbent in profit and market share. This result suggests that
   asymmetry in customer loyalty can be a source of "first-mover" advantage
   or disadvantage.

AB This paper examines a key difference between two promotional vehicles,
   coupons and rebates. Whereas coupons offer deals up front, with the
   purchase of the product, rebates can be redeemed only after purchase.
   When consumers experience uncertain redemption costs, this difference
   translates to a difference in when uncertainty is resolved. With coupons
   the uncertainty is resolved before purchase; with rebates the
   uncertainty is resolved after purchase. As a result, we show that
   rebates are more efficient in surplus extraction but coupons offer more
   finetuned control over whom to serve.
   We identify the conditions under which each is optimal, and these
   conditions turn on the gap between "low" reservation price consumers'
   valuations and their highest redemption costs. Rebates are optimal when
   this gap is large; coupons tend to be optimal otherwise. Risk aversity
   on the part of consumers reduces the attractiveness of rebates, as does
   the delay between rebate redemption and rebate payment, but the latter
   if and only if consumers are more impatient than the seller. These
   observations match up well with what we know about the use of these
   promotional vehicles in the real world.

   transitions. This paper introduces smooth transition regression models
   to study threshold-based price elasticity of the top 4 brands across 20
   fast-moving consumer good categories. Threshold-based price elasticity
   is found for 76% of all brands: 29% reflect historical benchmark prices,
   16% reflect competitive benchmark prices, and 31% reflect both types of
   benchmarks. The authors demonstrate asymmetry for gains versus losses on
   three levels: the threshold size and the sign and the magnitude of the
   elasticity difference. Interestingly, they observe latitude of
   acceptance for gains compared to the historical benchmark, but
   saturation effects in most other cases. Moreover, category
   characteristics influence the extent and the nature of threshold-based
   price elasticity, while individual brand characteristics impact the size
   of the price thresholds. From a managerial perspective, the paper
   illustrates the sales, revenue, and margin implications for price
   changes typically observed in consumer markets.

AB In this paper we characterize the impact of production technology on the
   optimal product line design. We analyze a problem in which a
   manufacturer segments the market on quality attributes and offers
   products that are partial substitutes. Because consumers self-select
   from the product line, product cannibalization is an issue. In addition,
   the manufacturer sets a production schedule in order to balance
   production setups with accumulation of inventories in the presence of
   economies of scale. We show that simultaneous optimization of the
   product line design and production schedule leads to insights that
   differ significantly from the common intuition and assertions in the
   literature, which omits either the demand side or the supply side of the
   equation. In particular, we demonstrate that more expensive production
   technology always leads to lower product prices and may at the same time
   lead to higher quality products. Further, a less efficient production
   technology does not necessarily increase total production costs or
   reduce consumer welfare. We also demonstrate that in the presence of
   production technology, the demand cannibalization problem may distort
   product quality upward or the number of products upward, which is
   contrary to the standard result.

AB Consumers aware of a new benefit will often experience uncertainty about
   its personal relevance or usage value. This paper shows that the
   decision to deliberate further to resolve this uncertainty and reach a
   polarized judgment of personal relevance critically depends on the
   posted price. In particular, a price above the consumer's initial
   willingness to pay might be thought provoking and enhance the perception
   of relevance with a certain probability. This behavioral mechanism is
   introduced formally and by way of an experiment with reference to the
   purchase of organic lettuce and fair-trade coffee. Accounting for the
   effect of price as a stimulus to think, a monopolistic firm should
   either over price ("transgressive pricing") or under price ("regressive
   pricing") in comparison to the consumer's willingness to pay. Under
   certain circumstances, the firm should also empower consumers with means
   that reduce the effort of deliberation.

   long-term memory for advertising and brand name recall.
   Recall-probability functions derived from the model are tested with
   classic data by Zielske (1959), as well as advertisement content and
   brand name recall data of a Dutch study that tracked over 40 campaigns
   of TV commercials. Data fits and cross-validation results indicate that
   the recall functions serve as a good first approximation for aggregate
   behavior. The shapes of optimal GRP schedules, which are obtained by
   maximizing a recall measure, are strongly related to the model
   parameters and corresponding memory processes. Comparisons with existing

AB The opening of Count Lev Nikolayevich (Leo) Tolstoy's novel inspired
   linguist, molecular physiologist and biogeographer Jared M. Diamond's
   eponym for the Anna Karenina principle (Diamond 1997). The principle
   suggests that no one property guarantees success but many guarantee
   failure. The Anna Karenina (TAK) bias is a logical consequence. TAK bias
   is more insidious than the kindred Survivor bias, which cautions that
   measured variables for passively observed survivors often differ from
   easily overlooked nonsurvivors. TAK bias, in contrast, cautions that the
   observed variables themselves might differ for survivors. The most
   revealing variables might exhibit negligible variation among survivors
   because survivors are necessarily alike. Perhaps variability is
   inversely related to the variable's importance for survival. TAK bias is
   more problematic for descriptive research, in contrast to normative
   (i.e., prescriptive) research, which seeks the true causal variables.
   Normative research only offers conditional aid to the decision maker on
   specific variables. To avoid TAK bias, we must not passively let
   accountants decide which variables we observe. We must actively collect
   data guided by predictions from deductive theory

AB The growing dominance of large retailers has altered traditional channel
   incentives for manufacturers. In this paper, we present a theoretical
   model to illustrate a strategic manufacturer response to a dominant
   retailer. In our model, a dominant and a weak retailer compete for the
   sale of a single product supplied by a single manufacturer. The dominant
   retailer has the power to dictate the wholesale price, but the
   manufacturer sets the wholesale price for the weak retailer. The
   manufacturer also has partial ability to transfer demand between
   retailers. In the strategic manufacturer response, the manufacturer
   begins by raising the wholesale price for the weak retailer over that
   for the dominant retailer. This makes the weak retailer the high-margin
   channel. The manufacturer then transfers demand to the weak retailer by
   engaging in joint promotions and advertising. We then use this strategic
   response model to derive a testable hypothesis that may guide future
   research in determining the source of dominant retailers' low prices.

AB Models of advertising response implicitly assume that the entire
   advertising budget is spent on disseminating one message. In practice,
   managers use different themes of advertising (for example, price
   advertisements versus product advertisements) and within each theme they
   employ different versions of an advertisement. In this study, we
   evaluate the dynamic effects of different themes of advertising that
   have been employed in a campaign. We develop a model that jointly
   considers the effects of wearout as well as that of forgetting in the
   context of an advertising campaign that employs five different
   advertising themes. We quantify the differential wearout effects across
   the different themes of advertising and examine the interaction effects
   between the different themes using a Bayesian dynamic linear model
   (DLM). Such a response model can help managers decide on the optimal
   allocation of resources across the portfolio of ads as well as better
   manage their scheduling. We develop a model to show how our response
   model parameters can be used to improve the effectiveness of advertising
   budget allocation across different themes. We find that a reallocation
   of resources across different themes according to our model results in a
   significant improvement in demand.

AB We propose a framework to investigate consumers' brand choice and
   purchase incidence decisions across multiple categories, where both
   decisions are modeled as an outcome of a consumer's basket Utility
   maximization. We build the model from first principles by theoretically
   explicating a general model of basket utility maximization and then
   examining the reasonable restrictions that can be placed to make the
   solution tractable without sacrificing its flexibility. Comparing with
   prior models, we show why prior multicategory purchase incidence models
   overemphasize the role of the cross effects of a market mix of brands in
   other categories on the purchase incidence decision of a given category.
   Additionally, we show that prior singlecategory models are a special
   case of the proposed model when further restrictions are placed on the
   basket utility structure.
   We estimate the model on household basket data for the laundry family of
   categories. We show (i) why prior single-category and multicategory
   models would systematically bias the estimates of the own- and
   cross-price/promotional purchase incidence elasticities; and (ii) how
   the market mix of each brand in each category affects the purchases
   across all categories, which can help retailers make promotional
   decisions across a portfolio of products.

AB A sequence of bids in Internet auctions can be viewed as record-breaking
   events in which only those data points that break the current record are
   observed. We investigate stochastic versions of the classical
   record-breaking problem for which we apply Bayesian estimation to
   predict observed bids and bid times in Internet auctions. Our approach
   to addressing this type of data is through data augmentation in which we
   assume that participants (bidders) have dynamically changing valuations
   for the auctioned item, but the latent number of bidders "competing" in
   those events is unseen.
   We use data from notebook auctions provided by one of the largest
   Internet auction sites in Korea. We find significant variation in the
   number of latent bidders across auctions. Our other primary findings are
   as follows: (1) the latent bidders are significant in number relative to
   observed bidders, (2) the latent number of remaining bidders is
   considerably smaller than that of new entrants to the auction after a
   given bid, and (3) larger bid and time increments significantly
   influence the bidding participation behavior of the remaining bidders.
   As part of our substantive contribution, we highlight the model's
   ability to understand brand equity in an Internet auction context
   through a brand's ability to simultaneously bring in bidders, higher bid
   amounts, and faster bidding.

   materialized in a case study of an Australian product-harm crisis faced

   this crisis on base sales, and on own- and cross-brand short- and

AB While marketing activities increasingly involve personalizing product
   offers to individually elicited preferences, these unique specifications
   may not be universally important for product choice. Providing evidence
   of the limits of treating each customer differently, three experiments
   show that individuals who exhibit interdependent or collectivistic
   tendencies tend to be more receptive to recommendations that are not
   personalized to their own preferences, but instead to the collective
   preferences of relevant in-groups. However, we find that cultural
   orientation affects responses to personalized recommendations for only
   those products whose consumption or choice decision is subject to public
   scrutiny. We further demonstrate that the favorability of thoughts
   elicited by ads offering targeted versus personalized offers mediates
   the effect of cultural orientation on responses to personalization.
   Finally, both individualistic and collectivistic consumers respond more
   favorably to offers of targeted recommendations when they believe
   relevant others share their preferences and when their level of
   expertise is relatively low.

   in an optimal contract, even with a monopoly manufacturer and no
   information asymmetry. On the other hand, slotting allowances do not
   arise with a monopoly retailer and no information asymmetry, whether the
   manufacturer is a monopoly or not. We also show that more intense retail
   competition, higher retail bargaining power, larger retailer fixed
   costs, lower marginal costs of retailing, as well as larger relative
   retailer size (whether coming from a location or operating advantage),
   have a positive impact on the incidence and the magnitude of slotting

AB Even in mature markets, managers are expected to improve their brands'
   performance year after year. When successful, they can expect to
   continue executing on an established marketing strategy. However, when
   the results are disappointing, a change or turnaround strategy may be
   called for to help performance get back on track. In such cases,
   performance diagnostics are needed to identify turnarounds and to
   quantify the role of marketing policy shifts in this process. This paper
   proposes a framework for such a diagnosis and applies several methods to
   provide converging evidence for two main findings. First, contrary to
   prevailing beliefs, the performance of brands in mature markets is not
   always stable. Instead, brands systematically improve or deteriorate
   their performance outlook in clearly identifiable time windows that are
   relatively short compared to windows of stability. Second, these shifts
   in performance regimes are associated with the brand's marketing actions
   and policy shifts, as opposed to competitive marketing.
   Promotion-oriented marketing policy shifts are particularly potent in
   improving a brand's performance outlook.

AB W hen designing price contracts, one of the major questions confronting
   managers is how many blocks there should be in the contract. We
   investigate this question in the setting of a manufacturer-retailer dyad
   facing a linear deterministic consumer demand. Theoretical marketing
   models predict that the manufacturer's profits rise dramatically when
   the number of blocks in the contract is increased from one to two
   because both channel efficiency and its share of channel profits
   increase. However, increasing the number of blocks to three yields no
   incremental profits.
   We test these predictions experimentally and find that increasing the
   number of blocks from one to two raises channel efficiency but not the
   manufacturer's share of profits. Surprisingly, having three blocks in
   the contract increases channel efficiency even further and also gives
   the manufacturer a slightly higher share of profits. We show that these
   results can be explained by a quantal response equilibrium model in
   which the manufacturer accounts for noisy best response due to
   nonpecuniary payoff components in the retailer's utility. We also show
   that the retailer is sensitive to the counterfactual profits it could
   have earned if it were charged a lower marginal price for earlier blocks
   in the multiple-block contract.

AB Retailers and manufacturers believe that the mere presence of certain
   items in a retail assortment increases the sales volume of the whole
   assortment. This paper provides an empirical study of the role of every
   item in an assortment. Our results show that many items affect category
   sales over and above their own sales volume. After deconstructing the
   role of a stockout of individual items into three effects-lost own
   sales, substitution to other items, and the category sales impact-we
   find that the category impact has the largest magnitude. Interestingly,
   the disproportionate impact of individual items on category sales is not
   restricted to top-selling items, for almost every single individual item
   affects category sales. It seems that variety is indeed the price of

AB Following a successful idea generation exercise, a company might easily
   be left with hundreds of ideas generated by experts, employees, or
   consumers. The next step is to screen these ideas and identify those
   with the highest potential. In this paper we propose a practical
   approach to involving consumers in idea screening. Although the number
   of ideas may potentially be very large, it would be unreasonable to ask
   each consumer to evaluate more than a few ideas. This raises the
   challenge of efficiently selecting the ideas to be evaluated by each
   consumer. We describe several idea-screening algorithms that perform
   this selection adaptively based on the evaluations made by previous
   consumers. We use simulations to compare and analyze the performance of
   the algorithms as well as to understand their behavior. The
   best-performing algorithm focuses on the ideas that are the most likely
   to have been misclassified (as "top" or "bottom" ideas) based on the
   previous evaluations, and avoids discarding ideas too fast by adding
   random perturbations to the misclassification probabilities. We
   demonstrate the convergent validity of this algorithm using a field
   experiment, which also confirms the convergence pattern predicted by
   simulations.

AB Managers often have incentives to artificially inflate current-term
   earnings by cutting marketing expenditures, even if it comes at the
   expense of long-term profits. Because investors rely on current-term
   accounting measures to form expectations of future-term profits
   inflating current-term results can lead to enhanced current-term stock
   price. We present evidence that some firms engage in this type of
   "myopic marketing management" at the time of a seasoned equity offering
   (SEO). In particular, a greater proportion of firms than is typical
   report earnings higher than normal and marketing expenditures lower than
   normal at the time of their SEC. Although they realize that firms might
   be undertaking strategies to artificially inflate current-term earnings,
   the financial markets are not adequately identifying and properly
   valuing the firms doing so. Our results indicate that myopic firms are
   able to temporarily inflate their stock market valuation, but in the
   long run, as the consequences of cutting marketing spending become
   manifest, they have inferior stock market performance. We propose some
   actions that might reduce the incentives for myopic behavior.

   utility function represents a standard lexicographic rule, and each of
   the proposed variants, over a set of discrete attributes. They then: (i)
   characterize the measurement properties of the parameters in the
   representations; (ii) propose a nonmetric procedure for inferring each
   lexicographic rule from pairwise comparisons of multiattribute
   alternatives (iii) describe a method for distinguishing among different
   lexicographic rules, and between lexicographic and linear preference
   models; and (iv) suggest how individual lexicographic rules can be
   combined to describe hierarchical market structures. The authors
   illustrate each of these aspects using data on personal-computer
   preferences. They find that two-thirds of the subjects in the sample use
   some kind of lexicographic rule. In contrast only one in five subjects
   use a standard lexicographic rule. This suggests that lexicographic
   rules are more widely used by consumers than one might have thought in
   the absence of the lexicographic variants described in the paper. The
   authors report a simulation assessing the ability of the proposed
   inference procedure to distinguish among alternative lexicographic
   models, and between linear-compensatory and lexicographic models.

AB W e model the diffusion of innovations in markets with two segments:
   influentials who are more in touch with new developments and who affect
   another segment of imitators whose own adoptions do not affect the
   influentials. This two-segment structure with asymmetric influence is
   consistent with several theories in sociology and diffusion research, as
   well as many "viral" or "network" marketing strategies. We have four
   main results. (1) Diffusion in a mixture of influentials and imitators
   can exhibit a dip or "chasm" between the early and later parts of the
   diffusion curve. (2) The proportion of adoptions stemming from
   influentials need not decrease monotonically, but may first decrease and
   then increase. (3) Erroneously specifying a mixed-influence model to a
   mixture process where influentials act independently from each other can
   generate systematic changes in the parameter values reported in earlier
   research. (4) Empirical analysis of 33 different data series indicates
   that the two-segment model fits better than the standard
   mixed-influence, the Gamma/Shifted Gompertz, and the Weibull-Gamma
   models, especially in cases where a two-segment structure is likely to
   exist. Also, the two-segment model fits about as well as the
   Karmeshu-Goswami mixed-influence model, in which the coefficients of
   innovation and imitation vary across potential adopters in a continuous
   fashion.

AB The cross-product term in moderated regression may be collinear with its
   constituent parts, making it difficult to detect main, simple, and
   interaction effects. The literature shows that mean-centering can reduce
   the covariance between the linear and the interaction terms, thereby
   suggesting that it reduces collinearity. We analytically prove that
   mean-centering neither changes the computational precision of
   parameters, the sampling accuracy of main effects, simple effects,
   interaction effects, nor the R-2. We also show that the determinants of
   the cross product matrix X ' X are identical for uncentered and
   mean-centered data, so the collinearity problem in the moderated
   regression is unchanged by mean-centering. Many empirical marketing
   researchers commonly mean-center their moderated regression data hoping
   that this will improve the precision of estimates from ill conditioned
   collinear data, but unfortunately, this hope is futile. Therefore,
   researchers using moderated regression models should not mean-center in
   a specious attempt to mitigate collinearity between the linear and the
   interaction terms. Of course, researchers may wish to mean-center for
   interpretive purposes and other reasons.

AB Observing reality is especially valuable. However, without models, every
   situation at every time on every variable would be unpredictable.
   Assumptions allow models and theories to assert constancy. Assumptions
   distill and simplify reality by dismissing the conspicuous but
   irrelevant. Criticizing assumptions as unrealistic is absurd.
   Abstraction is the precise virtue of an assumption. For example, seldom
   are we prisoners facing interrogation, yet the prisoner's dilemma
   remains relevant. The adage "A bird in the hand is worth two in the
   bush" is relevant for more than birds. Unrealistic assumptions that deny
   current beliefs breed great new theories.
   Assumptions are analogous to the basic ingredients in a gourmet recipe.
   Only the final product of the recipe dictates whether the ingredients
   suffice. Similarly, assumptions are realistic when they produce good
   theories, satisfactory predictions, valuable implications, and correct
   recommendations. Output matters far more than input. Realism is only an
   issue when creatively diagnosing poorly performing models, not when
   judging model performance.
   Assumptions are the source of value in empirical analyses. If data sets
   were truly the source of value, empirical research studies would only
   greatly devalue the raw data by dramatically reducing rich observations
   to a few meager summary statistics or estimated parameters. Most
   empirical research makes a contribution by ignoring (assuming away) most
   information in the data.
   We must dramatically shift our attention far away from the hopeless
   pursuit and sophistry of realistic assumptions to the contribution those
   assumptions produce. There are scientific methods for evaluating model
   output (i.e., predictions, findings, implications, recommendation) on
   criteria such as accuracy, reliability, validity, robustness, and so on.
   No corresponding objective scientific methods exist for evaluating
   realism. Realism depends only on personal taste.

AB W e propose that the variety a brand offers often serves as a quality
   cue and thus influences which brand consumers choose. Specifically,
   brands that offer a greater variety of options that appear compatible
   and require similar skills tend to be perceived as having greater
   category expertise or core competency in the category, which, in turn,
   enhances their perceived quality and purchase likelihood. Six studies
   support this proposition and demonstrate that compared to brands which
   offer fewer products, (a) brands which offer increased compatible
   variety are perceived as having higher quality; (b) this effect is
   mediated by product variety's impact on perceived expertise; (c) the
   higher perceived quality produces a greater choice share of the higher
   variety brand, even among consumers who select options that multiple
   brands offer and (d) product variety also impacts post-experience
   perceptions of taste. The findings suggest that in addition to directly
   affecting brand choice share through influencing the fit with consumer
   preferences, product line length can also indirectly affect brand choice
   through influencing perceived brand quality.

   brand demand, wholesale prices, and retailer category-management
   considerations as drivers of retail prices. Interestingly, competitive
   retailer prices account for less than 10% of the over-time variation in

   demand are the main drivers of retail-price variation over time.
   Moreover, the influence of these price drivers on retailer pricing
   tactics is linked to retailer category margin. We find that demand-based
   pricing and category-management considerations are associated with
   higher retailer margins. In contrast, dependence on pricing history and

AB T he free-riding problem occurs if the presales activities needed to
   sell a product can be conducted separately from the actual sale of the
   product. Intuitively, free riding should hurt the retailer that provides
   that service, but the author shows analytically that free riding
   benefits not only the free-riding retailer, but also the retailer that
   provides the service when customers are heterogeneous in terms of their
   opportunity costs for shopping. The service-providing retailer has a
   postservice advantage, because customers who have resolved their
   matching uncertainty through sales service incur zero marginal shopping
   cost if they purchase from the service-providing retailer rather than
   the free-riding retailer. Moreover, allowing free riding gives the free
   rider less incentive to compete with the service provider on price,
   because many customers eventually will switch to it due to their own
   free riding. In turn, this induced soft strategic response enables the
   service provider to charge a higher price and enjoy the strictly
   positive profit that otherwise would have been wiped away by
   head-to-head price competition. Therefore, allowing free riding can be
   regarded as a necessary mechanism that prevents an aggressive response
   from another retailer and reduces the intensity of price competition.

AB Consumers often have to evaluate products comprising a combination of
   attributes that is not expected by them, given their beliefs about how
   attributes normally co-vary in the product category. Such an attribute
   combination implies that the claimed level of a product attribute is
   then different from what the consumer might infer, given the level of
   another attribute, resulting in what we call product incoherence. We
   develop a model to calibrate the effect of incoherence on perceptions,
   uncertainty, preference, and ultimately purchase. Our model can allow
   managers to determine consumers' acceptance for different positions in
   the multiattribute space, so they can optimize their product's
   positioning. Our model implies that a product that combines positively
   valued attributes might increase some elements of preference for the
   product, but if those attributes occur in unexpected combinations,
   incoherence will also increase uncertainty which in turn might lower
   other elements of preference. The net risk-adjusted preference for a
   product in our model accommodates both the benefit from the expected
   attribute levels and the uncertainty associated with incoherence. We
   derive implications from the model and provide an empirical test that
   supports those implications.

AB In this paper we define an embedded premium (EP) as an enhancement that
   involves a social cause added on to a product or service. We
   characterize EP as a sales promotion strategy and juxtapose it with
   traditional approaches, such as discounts and rebates. Across three
   experiments, using a nationwide Internet panel and employing stated
   measures and model-based inference, we find that at low denominations EP
   is more effective than an equivalent price discount. We describe how an
   EP's social association may influence consumer choice quite differently
   than price promotions and, contrary to the asymmetric price promotion
   effect documented in the promotions literature, we find that EP benefits
   an unknown brand more than a known brand. Our hierarchical Bayes
   approach uncovers heterogeneity in EP effectiveness that can be
   explained by affinity toward the focal charity, personal motivations,
   and demographic markers. An identifiable segment of individuals prefer
   the "other" over "self," suggesting possible EP optimization and
   segmentation strategies. Two such strategies, custornization and
   coverage, are empirically tested, and the former is shown to be very
   effective. Our findings have broad implications for brand managers with
   regard to resource allocation and EP program return on investment (ROI),
   as well as important social welfare implications.

AB Greedoid languages provide a basis to infer best-fitting noncompensatory

   such as consider-then-rank, consider-only, or choice data. Potential
   decision rules include elimination by aspects, acceptance by aspects,
   lexicographic by features, and a mixed-rule lexicographic by aspects
   (LBA) that nests the other rules. We provide a dynamic program that
   makes estimation practical for a moderately large numbers of aspects.
   We test greedoid methods with applications to SmartPhones (339
   respondents, both full-rank and considerthen-rank data) and computers
   (201 respondents from Lenk et al. 1996). We compare LBA to two
   compensatory benchmarks: hierarchical Bayes ranked logit (HBRL) and
   LINMAP. For each benchmark, we consider an unconstrained model and a
   model constrained so that aspects are truly compensatory. For both data
   sets, LBA predicts (new task) holdouts at least as well as compensatory
   methods for the majority of the respondents. LBXs relative predictive
   ability increases (ranks and choices) if the task is full rank rather
   than consider then rank. LBA's relative predictive ability does not
   change if (1) we allow respondents to presort profiles, or (2) we
   increase the number of profiles in a consider-then-rank task from 16 to
   32. We examine trade-offs between effort and accuracy for the type of
   task and the number of profiles.

AB T he Customer Equity and Lifetime Management (CELM) solution is based on
   a decision-support system that offers marketing managers a scientific
   framework for the optimal planning and budgeting of targeted marketing
   campaigns to maximize return on marketing investments. The CELM
   technology combines advanced models of Markov decision processes (MDPs),
   Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio optimization. MDPs are used to
   model customer dynamics and to find optimal marketing policies that
   maximize the value generated by a customer over a given time horizon.
   Lifetime value optimization is achieved through dynamic programming
   algorithms that identify which marketing actions, such as cross-selling,
   up-selling, and loyalty marketing campaigns, transition customers to
   better value and loyalty states. The CELM technology can also be used to
   simulate the financial impact of a given marketing policy using Monte
   Carlo simulation. This allows marketing managers to simulate several
   targeting scenarios to assess budget requirements and the expected
   impact of a given marketing policy. The benefits of the solution are
   illustrated with the Finnair case study, where CELM has been used to
   optimize marketing planning and budgeting for Finnair's frequent-flyer
   program (UP).

AB We quantified the net unit and profit impact of each promotion offered

   drivers of variation in this net impact. We used this analysis to
   identify the least effective promotions and conducted a controlled field
   test to demonstrate the impact of eliminating them before chainwide
   implementation. Our key findings are as follows. First, approximately
   45% of the gross lift from promotions is incremental for CVS. Further,
   for every unit of gross lift, 0.16 unit of some other product is
   purchased elsewhere in the store. Still, more than 50% of promotions are
   not profitable because the lower promotional margin is not sufficiently
   offset by incremental units. Second, there is substantial variation in
   net profit impact across categories. Our field test shows that
   eliminating promotions chainwide in 15 of the worst performing
   categories will decrease sales by about $7.8 million but will improve
   profit by approximately $52.6 million. This is very impressive given
   that CVS front store sales in 2003 were approximately $9 billion while
   the net profit impact of promotions was -$25.3 million.

AB The main objective of this report is to describe a decision-support
   system for dynamic retail pricing and promotion planning. Our weekly
   demand model incorporates price, reference price effects, seasonality,
   article availability information, features, and discounts. Building on
   previous research, we quantify demand interdependencies and integrate
   the resulting profit-lifting effects into the optimal pricing model. The
   methodology was developed and implemented at bauMax, an Austrian
   do-it-yourself retailer. Along with the practical requirements, an
   objective function was employed that can be used as a vehicle for
   implementing a retailer's strategy. Eight pricing rounds with thousands
   of different stock-keeping units have each served as a testing ground
   for our approach. Based on various benchmarking methods, a positive
   impact On profit was reported. The currently implemented marketing
   decision-support system increased gross profit on average by 8.1 and
   sales by 2.1%.

   peer-reviewed publication. The editorial starts by explaining the role
   of the players (the editors, the review team, the area editor). The
   editorial then covers each step in the review process, from how
   reviewers are selected to how authors should respond to different
   outcomes. The editorial ends by discussing citation metrics,
   appointments to the editorial board and copyrights. This article argues
   that (1) requesting more reviews yields a faster, more informative
   review process; (2) publishing more articles can raise citations per
   article; (3) for many submissions, some reviewers should evaluate
   procedures, whereas others should evaluate contribution; (4) reviewers
   should not micromanage revisions; (5) editors must, unfortunately, write
   overly cautious decision letters; and (6) it is important to reward
   reviewers with board appointments and published acknowledgments.

AB Polyhedral methods for choice-based conjoint analysis provide a means to
   adapt choice-based questions at the individual-respondent level and
   provide an alternative means to estimate partworths when there are
   relatively few questions per respondent, as in a Web-based
   questionnaire. However, these methods are deterministic and are
   susceptible to the propagation of response errors. They also assume,
   implicitly, a uniform prior on the partworths. In this paper we provide
   a probabilistic interpretation of polyhedral methods and propose
   improvements that incorporate response error and/or informative priors
   into individual-level question selection and estimation.
   Monte Carlo simulations suggest that response-error modeling and
   informative priors improve polyhedral question-selection methods in the
   domains where they were previously weak. A field experiment with over
   2,200 leading-edge wine consumers in the United States, Australia, and
   New Zealand suggests that the new question-selection methods show
   promise relative to existing methods.

AB Bias in the market for news is well-documented. Recent research in
   economics explains the phenomenon by assuming that consumers want to
   read (watch) news that is consistent with their tastes or prior beliefs
   rather than the truth. The present paper builds on this idea but
   recognizes that (i) besides "biased" consumers, there are also
   "conscientious" consumers whose sole interest is in discovering the
   truth, and (ii) consistent with reality, media bias is constrained by
   the truth. These two factors were expected to limit media bias in a
   competitive setting. Our results reveal the opposite. We find that media
   bias may increase when there are more conscientious consumers. However,
   this increased media bias does not necessarily hurt conscientious
   consumers who may be able to recover more information from multiple
   media outlets the more the outlets are biased. We discuss the practical
   implications of these findings for media positioning, media pricing,
   media planning, and the targeting of advertising.

AB Reverse auctions are fast becoming the standard for many procurement
   activities. In the past, the majority of such auctions have been solely
   price based, but increasingly attributes other than price affect the
   auction outcome. Specifically, the buyer uses a scoring function to
   compare bids and the bid with the highest score wins. We investigate two
   mechanisms commonly used for procurement in business-to-business
   markets, in a setting in which buyers' welfare is affected by exogenous
   nonprice attributes such as the quality, service, and past
   relationships. Under both mechanisms, bidders bid based on price, but in
   the "buyer-determined" mechanism, the buyer is free to select the bid
   that maximizes her surplus while in the "price-based" mechanism, the
   buyer commits to awarding the contract to the low price bidder. We find,
   both in theory and in the laboratory, that the "buyer-determined"
   mechanism increases the buyer's welfare only as long as enough suppliers
   compete. If the number of suppliers is small and the correlation between
   cost and quality is low, the buyer is better off with the "price-based"
   mechanism. These findings are intended to help procurement managers make
   better decisions in designing procurement mechanisms for a variety of
   settings.

   the likelihood function. We show that, once the data are collected,
   adhering to the likelihood principle leads to analysis where endogeneity
   becomes ignorable for estimation. The likelihood principle is implicit

   encroaches on the retailer's operations by selling directly to final
   consumers. We demonstrate that the retailer can benefit from
   encroachment even when encroachment admits no synergies and does not
   facilitate product differentiation or price discrimination. The retailer
   benefits because encroachment induces the encroaching supplier to reduce
   the wholesale price in order not to diminish unduly the retailer's
   demand for the manufacturer's wholesale product. The lower wholesale
   price and increased downstream competition mitigate double
   marginalization problems and promote efficiency gains that can secure

   differentiation can help foster collusion under some common models of

AB Dual process models conceptualize two systems of processing that are
   activated when presented with a decision task, the quick and affective
   System I and the deliberative and rule-based System 2. In this article,
   we explore whether the affective component of System 1 has the potential
   to interfere with the information integration component of System 2 by
   utilizing everyday consumer decision-making situations that require the
   integration of provided information to make optimal choices. We posit
   that if the provided information has an affective System I element, then
   the affective reaction serves as an input to the System 2 process of
   information integration. Such an affective input has the potential to
   cause improper information integration resulting in a biased mental
   representation, which in turn leads to suboptimal choices. Across three
   experiments, we test the interfering role of affect in information
   integration. Experiment I establishes the mediating role of the
   affective System I generating a preference for the suboptimal option and
   rules out the alternate account of analytical skills. Experiments 2 and
   3 provide converging evidence for the proposed account that System 1
   interferes with System 2 and argue against the alternate account of
   System 1 directly influencing choice.

AB This paper examines the effects of brand credibility, a central concept
   in information economics-based approaches to brand effects and brand
   equity, on consumer choice and choice set formation. We investigate the
   mechanisms through which credibility effects materialize, namely,
   through perceived quality, perceived risk, and information costs saved.
   The credibility of a brand as a signal is defined as the believability
   of the product position information contained in a brand, which depends
   on consumer perceptions of the willingness and ability of firms to
   deliver what they have promised. The choice set is defined as the
   collection of brands that have a nonzero probability of being chosen
   among those actually available for choice in a given context.
   Furthermore, we study the impact of brand credibility on the variance of
   the stochastic component of utility. Not only do choice model parameters
   capture the impact of systematic utility differences on choice
   probabilities, but also the magnitude of this systematic impact is
   moderated by the relative importance of the stochastic utility component
   in preference. We term this moderation phenomenon preference
   discrimination, which we conceptualize as the decision makers' capacity
   to effectively discriminate between products' utilities in choice
   situations.
   We estimate a discrete choice model of brand choice set formation and
   preference discrimination on experimental data in two categories-juice
   and personal computers-and find strong evidence for brand credibility
   effects and differential mechanisms through which brand credibility's
   impact materializes on brand choice conditional on choice set, choice
   set formation, and preference discrimination.

AB In communication, information, and other industries, three-part tariffs
   are increasingly popular. A three-part tariff is defined by an access
   price, an allowance, and a marginal price for any usage in excess of the
   allowance. Empirical nonlinear pricing studies have focused on consumer
   choice under two-part tariffs. We show that consumer behavior differs
   under three-part tariffs and assess how consumer demand uncertainty
   impacts tariff choice. We develop a discrete/continuous model of choice
   among three-part tariffs and estimate it using consumer-level data on
   Internet usage. Our model extends prior work in accommodating consumer
   switching to competitors, thereby capturing behavior in competitive
   industries more accurately Our empirical work shows that demand
   uncertainty is a key driver of choice among three-part tariffs.
   Consumers' expected bill increases with the variation in their usage,
   steering them toward tariffs with high allowances. Consequently, demand
   uncertainty decreases consumer surplus and increases provider revenue. A
   further analysis of consumers' responsiveness to the different elements
   of a three-part tariff under the provider's current pricing structure
   reveals that prices affect a consumer's tariff choice more than her
   usage quantity and that the allowance plays a strong role in consumer
   tariff choice. Based on our results, we derive implications for pricing
   with three-part tariffs.

AB Recent research studies have shown that, in the aggregate, survey
   participation is associated with increased purchase behaviors. Whereas
   selective customer response could be responsible for some of this
   correlation, we conclude that survey participation does cause changes in
   purchase behavior. On the basis of this conclusion, we investigate the
   possible differential impact of participating in a firm-sponsored
   satisfaction survey on (1) services purchases, (2) responsiveness to
   promotions, (3) interpurchase time, and (4) spending, across customers.
   We develop a joint model of these four customer behaviors and explicitly
   examine the role of customer characteristics and store-specific
   variables in moderating the effects of survey participation. We also
   study how these effects change over time.
   The data used for the analysis come from a longitudinal field study of
   customer satisfaction conducted by a U.S. automotive services firm. It
   contains two groups of customers. One group was administered a customer
   satisfaction survey and the other was not. Our results reveal a
   substantial positive relationship between satisfaction survey
   participation and all the customer behaviors studied. Assuming a causal
   relationship, we also find the effects of satisfaction survey
   participation to vary across customers and stores, and over time.

AB Despite warnings against inferring causality from observed correlations
   or statistical dependence, some articles do. Observed correlation is
   neither necessary nor sufficient to infer causality as defined by the
   term's everyday usage. For example, a deterministic causal process
   creates pseudorandom numbers; yet, we observe no correlation between the
   numbers. Child height correlates with spelling ability because age
   causes both. Moreover, order is problematic-we hear train whistles
   before observing trains, yet trains cause whistles.
   Scientific methods specifically prohibit inferring causal theories from
   specific observations (i.e., effects) because, in part, many credible
   causes are perfectly consistent with available observations. Moreover,
   actions inferred from effects have more unintended consequences than
   actions based on sound deductive causal theories because causal theories
   predict multiple effects. However, an often overlooked but key feature
   of these theories is that we describe the cause with more variables than
   the effect. Consequently, inductive processes might appear deductive as
   the number of effects increases relative to the number of potential
   causes. For example, in real criminal trials, jurors judge whether
   sufficient evidence exists to infer guilt. In contrast, determining
   guilt in criminal mystery novels is deductive because the number of
   clues (i.e., effects) is large relative to the number of potential
   suspects (i.e., causes). We can make inferential tasks resemble
   deductive tasks by increasing the number of effects (i.e., variables)
   relative to the number of potential causes and seeking a shared cause
   for all observed effects. Moreover, under some conditions, the method of
   seeking shared causes might approach deductive reasoning when the number
   of causes is strictly limited. At least, the resulting number of
   possible causal theories is far less than the number generated from
   repeated observations of a single effect (i.e., variable).

AB When faced with a choice of selecting one of several available products
   (or possibly buying nothing), according to standard theoretical
   perspectives, people will choose the option with the highest
   cost-benefit difference. However, we propose that decisions about free
   (zero price) products differ, in that people do not simply subtract
   costs from benefits but instead they perceive the benefits associated
   with free products as higher. We test this proposal by contrasting
   demand for two products across conditions that maintain the price
   difference between the goods, but vary the prices such that the cheaper
   good in the set is priced at either a low positive or zero price. In
   contrast with a standard cost-benefit perspective, in the zero-price
   condition, dramatically more participants choose the cheaper option,
   whereas dramatically fewer participants choose the more expensive
   option. Thus, people appear to act as if zero pricing of a good not only
   decreases its cost, but also adds to its benefits. After documenting
   this basic effect, we propose and test several psychological antecedents
   of the effect, including social norms, mapping difficulty, and affect.
   Affect emerges as the most likely account for the effect.

   test this thesis by an event analysis of abnormal returns to stock
   prices of firms whose new products are evaluated in The Wall Street
   Journal. Quality has a strong immediate effect on abnormal returns,
   which is substantially higher than that for other marketing events
   assessed in prior studies. Moreover, there are some important
   asymmetries in the effect. We discuss the research, managerial,
   investing, and policy implications.

AB When an improvable durable good (such as packaged software) saturates
   the market, the seller could be tempted to release new versions too
   frequently, hurting her profit. A novel contractual device, which I term
   as a Free New Version Rights warranty (free NVR warranty), can help the
   seller overcome this temptation. In a two-period game-theoretic model
   involving a monopolist firm facing heterogeneous consumers, I derive
   conditions under which a rational monopolist can act suboptimally: She
   could face a commitment problem and offer the new version, even if doing
   so lowers her overall profit. Profit is hurt because when consumers
   expect a new version, (a) fewer consumers buy the initial version, and
   (b) the monopolist is forced to charge a lower price for the initial
   version. I show how the free NVR warranty; which requires the monopolist
   to offer consumers the right to receive the new version for free for a
   limited period, can solve her commitment problem. This is a new,
   surprising finding: By bundling new-version rights with the initial
   version, the monopolist at first appears to be denying herself future
   revenue. I derive conditions under which this apparently unprofitable
   action is optimal, which is my main contribution. When free NVR is
   offered, consumer surplus decreases and social surplus increases. This
   work extends prior literature on durable goods and the Coase conjecture
   to innovative durable goods with network externalities. The findings
   have important practical implications for firms selling new versions of
   innovative durable goods subject to network effects, as well as for
   their consumers.

AB This paper examines optimal product positioning strategies of asymmetric
   firms in the context of retail outlet locations in the fast food
   industry. The relationships between profits and product differentiation
   reveal that both McDonald's and Burger King are better off avoiding
   close competition if the market area is large enough. However, in small
   market areas, McDonald's would prefer to be located together with Burger
   King rather than have the two outlets be only a slight distance apart.
   In contrast, Burger King's profits always increase with greater
   differentiation. Offsetting these incentives is the desirability of
   locating centrally to appeal to the most customers. The equilibrium
   depends on the market's size. In small markets, McDonald's locates near
   the center of the market, and Burger King locates to the side of the
   market. In larger markets, McDonald's and Burger King choose locations
   on opposite sides of the market, although McDonald's locates closer to
   the optimal central location than Burger King.
   I also show that the role of price competition on product positioning is
   fundamentally different under asymmetric competition than under
   symmetric competition. Price competition unambiguously induces symmetric
   firms toward differentiation. In contrast, with asymmetric firms, price
   competition shifts Burger King's incentives toward locating closer to
   McDonald's, even while price competition increases McDonald's desire for
   differentiation. As a result, equilibrium locations with asymmetric
   firms are approximately the same, regardless of whether prices adjust
   with location.

AB We propose and test a new approach for modeling consumer heterogeneity
   in conjoint estimation based on convex optimization and statistical
   machine learning. We develop methods both for metric and choice data.
   Like hierarchical Bayes (HB), our methods shrink individual-level
   partworth estimates towards a population mean. However, while HB samples
   from a posterior distribution that is influenced by exogenous parameters
   (the parameters of the second-stage priors), we minimize a convex loss
   function that depends only on endogenous parameters. As a result, the
   amounts of shrinkage differ between the two approaches, leading to
   different estimation accuracies. In our comparisons, based on
   simulations as well as empirical data sets, the new approach overall
   outperforms standard HB (i.e., with relatively diffuse second-stage
   priors) both with metric and choice data.

AB We offer a simple model of intertemporal choice to characterize how
   planned versus actual behaviors evolve for time-inconsistent smokers.
   Our results suggest that smokers' participation and cessation decisions
   are governed by the interplay between three effects. The cessation
   effect leads smokers to advance their plans to quit smoking, whereas the
   procrastination effect leads them to consecutively revise their planned
   quitting age upwards. Consequently, the duration of smoking is
   effectively governed by which one of these two effects is dominant.
   Finally, for certain consumer segments, a threshold effect causes an
   "all or nothing" type of extreme smoking behavior based on certain
   critical values of present-biased preferences. Our results provide some
   preliminary evidence that both marketing efforts by tobacco firms and
   public policy initiatives can have a significant influence on smoking
   behavior. In particular, we find that reductions in the age at which
   individuals start smoking may not only vastly extend their duration of
   smoking, but also convert potential "never smokers" into lifetime
   smokers. Finally, we estimate a hazard model using survey data from over
   800 smokers to provide evidence in support of our theoretical model.

AB In most marketing experiments, managerial decisions are not based
   directly on the estimates of the parameters but rather on functions of
   these estimates. For example, many managerial decisions are driven by
   whether or not a feature is valued more than the price the consumer will
   be asked to pay. In other cases, some managerial decisions are weighed
   more heavily than others. The standard measures used to evaluate
   experimental designs (e.g., A-efficiency or D-efficiency) do not
   accommodate these phenomena. We propose alternative "managerial
   efficiency" criteria (M-errors) that are relatively easy to implement.
   We explore their properties, suggest practical algorithms to decrease
   errors, and provide illustrative examples. Realistic examples suggest
   improvements of as much as 30% in managerial efficiency. We close by
   considering approximations for nonlinear criteria and extensions to
   choice-based experiments.

   forward-looking patient unit-demand bidders in a sequential auction
   market. Such a seller faces a fundamental choice between two selling
   regimes: adaptive selling that involves learning about remaining demand
   from early prices, and commitment selling that forgoes such learning and
   makes all selling decisions in the beginning of the game. A model of the
   game between the seller and the bidders is proposed to characterize the
   optimal regime choice. The model implies that the relative profitability
   of the two regimes depends on the expected gains from trade: when the
   expected gains from trade are low, commitment dominates adaptation, and
   vice versa.

AB IIA (independence of irrelevant alternatives) axiom states that the
   ratio of choice probabilities of any two brands will depend only on the
   utilities of the brands. However, even if the utilities of brands are
   assumed to be fixed, their choice probabilities will be affected by the
   similarity between them. This study and several other previous studies
   show that a more preferred (higher utility) brand benefits more in a
   high similarity situation than a less preferred (lower utility) brand,
   which is called the asymmetric similarity effect or simply the
   asymmetric effect in this study This study expands on the asymmetric
   effect that has been reported by many previous empirical studies and
   implied in choice modeling literature, by giving it an explicit
   mathematical formulation based on the analysis of the
   elimination-by-tree (EBT) model (Tversky and Sattath 1979). This study
   also provides an integrative theoretical summary showing how the
   asymmetric effect is related to the similarity effect, dominance effect,

AB Cross-brand pass-through implies that a retailer responds to wholesale
   promotional support from a target brand by changing the retail prices of
   competitive brands. Besanko et al. (2005) model a target brand's retail
   price as a function of its own and other brands' wholesale prices using
   780 observations (15 price zones x 52 weeks) and take the many
   significant coefficients for other brands' wholesale prices that they
   find as evidence of cross-brand pass-through. Because price zones do not
   react independently to wholesale prices when they set a brand's retail
   price, Besanko et al.'s (2005) estimation overstates the number of
   independent observations by a factor of 15. When we correct for this
   overstatement of independent observations, we find that the number of
   stable, significant coefficients for other brands' wholesale prices is
   lower than one would expect by chance. We conclude that there is no
   evidence of cross-brand pass-through in the 11 categories analyzed by
   Besanko et al. (2005).

AB A multinomial logit model of brand choice, calibrated on 32 weeks of
   purchases of regular ground coffee by 100 households, shows high
   statistical significance for the explanatory variables of brand loyalty,
   size loyalty, presence/absence of store promotion, regular shelf price
   and promotional price cut. The model is parsimonious in that the
   coefficients of these variables are modeled to be the same for all
   coffee brand-sizes. The calibrated model predicts remarkably well the
   share of purchases by brand-size in a hold-out sample of 100 households
   over the 32-week calibration period and a subsequent 20-week forecast
   period. The success of the model is attributed in part to the level of
   detail and completeness of the household panel data employed, which has
   been collected through optical scanning of the Universal Product Code in
   supermarkets.
   Three short-term market response measures are calculated from the model:
   regular (depromoted) price elasticity of share, percent increase in
   share for a promotion with a median price cut, and promotional price cut
   elasticity of share. Response varies across brand-sizes in a systematic
   way with large share brand-sizes showing less response in percentage
   terms but greater in absolute terms. On the basis of the model a
   quantitative picture emerges of groups of loyal customers who are
   relatively insensitive to marketing actions and a pool of switchers who
   are quite sensitive.

AB Channel coordination and, more generally, coordination of activities
   between interdependent economic agents is even more important today than
   when the paper was published more than 20 years ago. One reason is the
   trend toward globalization and outsourcing caused, in part, by the
   development of increasingly complex products and services that integrate
   many different competencies. Coordination today involves all the aspects
   of the marketing mix: product design coordination, price and service
   coordination (the focus of "Managing Channel Profits"), coordination of
   availability in highly hybrid distribution systems to better reach an
   increasingly complex and fragmented market, and coordination of
   communication with the target market. "Managing Channel Profits" argues
   a tendency toward a lack of coordination without explicit institutional
   arrangements and coordination mechanisms such as quantity discounts and
   contracts to solve the problem. The price and service coordination ideas
   of "Managing Channel Profits" have been successfully applied for 25
   years of developments in marketing of revenue- and cost-sharing
   arrangements between increasingly interdependent market participants.

AB A channel of distribution consists of different channel members each
   having his own decision variables. However, each channel member's
   decisions do affect the other channel members' profits and, as a
   consequence, actions. A lack of coordination of these decisions can lead
   to undesirable consequences. For example, in the simple
   manufacturer-retailer-consumer channel, uncoordinated and independent
   channel members' decisions over margins result in a higher price paid by
   the consumer than if those decisions were coordinated. In addition, the
   ensuing suboptimal volume leads to lower profits for both the
   manufacturer and the retailer.
   This paper explores the problems inherent in channel coordination. We
   address the following questions.
   What is the effect of channel coordination?
   What causes a lack of coordination in the channel?
   How difficult is it to achieve channel coordination?
   What mechanisms exist which can achieve channel coordination?
   What are the strengths and weaknesses of these mechanism?
   What is the role of nonprice variables (e.g., manufacturer advertising,
   retailer shelf-space) in coordination?
   Does the lackof coordination affect normative implications from in-store
   experimentation?
   Can quantity discounts be a coordination mechanism?
   Are some marketing practices actually disguised quantity discounts?
   We review the literature and present a simple formulation illustrating
   the roots of the coordination problem. We then derive the form of the
   quantity discount schedule that results in optimum channel profits.

   personal selling function, i.e., the use of employee ("direct")
   salespeople rather than manufacturers' representatives ("reps"). A
   hypothesized model is developed based on both transaction cost analysis
   and the sales force management literature. Data from 13 electronic
   component manufacturers covering 159 U.S. sales districts are used to
   estimate a logistic model of the probability of "going direct" in a
   given district. Results are shown to be stable across specification and
   estimation methods and to fit the data well. The transaction cost model
   is generally supported. The principal finding is that the greater the
   difficulty of evaluating a salesperson's performance, the more likely
   the firm to substitute surveillance for commission as a control
   mechanism, i.e., to use a direct sales force. Among other findings,
   direct sales forces are also associated with complex, hard-to-learn
   product lines and with districts that demand considerable nonselling
   activities. Several factors prove unrelated, including company size, the
   amount of travel a district requires, and the importance of key
   accounts.

AB For every new product and service entrant, there are usually many
   incumbents who must defend their positions in the market. Hence,
   defensive strategy is as least as critical as new-product strategy. Our
   1983 article argued that defensive strategy critically depends on the
   distribution of buyer preferences and the position of the new entrant
   relative to the position of the incumbent in a multidimensional
   attribute space. Since the appearance of our 1983 article in Marketing
   Science, research in defensive strategy has progressed in both
   prescriptive and descriptive directions. Subsequent research on
   defensive strategy has also addressed empirical, methodological,
   theoretical, and substantive issues. Today, defensive strategy is more
   important than ever, with shorter new-product life cycles, persistent
   service innovation, remarkable technological change, global competition,
   and the invention of new channels of distributions.

AB This paper analyzes how a firm should adjust its marketing expenditures
   and its price to defend its position in an existing market from attack
   by a competitive new product. Our focus is to provide usable managerial
   recommendations on the strategy of response. In particular we show that
   if products can be represented by their position in a multiattribute
   space, consumers are heterogeneous and maximize utility, and awareness
   advertising and distribution can be summarized by response functions,
   then for the profit maximizing firm:
   it is optimal to decrease awareness advertising,
   it is optimal to decrease the distribution budget unless the new product
   can be kept out of the market,
   a price increase may be optimal, and
   even under the optimal strategy, profits decrease as a result of the
   competitive new product.
   Furthermore, if the consumer tastes are uniformly distributed across the
   spectrum
   a price decrease increases defensive profits,
   it is optimal (at the margin) to improve product quality in the
   direction of the defending product's strength and
   it is optimal (at the margin) to reposition by advertising in the same
   direction.
   In addition we provide practical procedures to estimate (1) the
   distribution of consumer tastes and (2) the position of the new product
   in perceptual space from sales data and knowledge of the percent of
   consumers who are aware of the new product and find it available.
   Competitive diagnostics, such as the angle of attack, are introduced to
   help the defending manager.

   equilibrium distribution structures in a duopoly where each manufacturer
   distributes its goods through a single exclusive retailer, which may be
   either a franchised outlet or a factory store. Static linear demand and
   cost functions are assumed, and a number of rules about players'
   expectations of competitors' behavior are examined. It is found that for
   most specifications product substitutability does influence the
   equilibrium distribution structure. For low degrees of substitutability,
   each manufacturer will distribute its product through a company store;
   for more highly competitive goods, manufacturers will be more likely to
   use a decentralized distribution system.

   commodity with a short shelf or demand life. A hierarchical model is
   developed, and the results of the single period inventory model are used
   to examine possible pricing and return policies. The paper shows that
   several such policies currently in effect are suboptimal. These include
   those where the manufacturer offers retailers full credit for all unsold
   goods or where no returns of unsold goods are permitted. The paper also
   demonstrates that a policy whereby a manufacturer offers retailers full
   credit for a partial return of goods may achieve channel coordination,
   but that the optimal return allowance will be a function of retailer
   demand. Therefore, such a policy cannot be optimal in a multi-retailer
   environment. It is proven, however, that a pricing and return policy in
   which a manufacturer offers retailers a partial credit for all unsold
   goods can achieve channel coordination in a multi-retailer environment.

   performances. customer evaluations. customer spending and comparable

   The authors test the model using three matched samples of 1,615 retail
   employees, 57,656 customers, and 306 stores of a single retail chain.
   The authors find that three retail employee job perceptions
   (conscientiousness, perceived organizational justice, and organizational
   identification) have main and interactive effects on three dimensions of
   employee job performance (in-role performance, extra-role performance
   toward customers, and extra-role performance toward the organization).
   In turn, these performance dimensions exert influence on customer
   evaluations of the retailer (a satisfaction, purchase intent, loyalty,
   and word-of-mouth composite). The authors also show that employee
   perceptions exert a direct influence on customer evaluations, and that
   customer evaluations affect retail store performance (customer spending
   and comparable store sales growth).
   Finally, the authors conduct some simple simulations that show: (1) how
   changes in employee perceptions may raise average employee performances;
   (2) how changes in employee performances enhance average customer
   evaluations; and (3) how changes in customer evaluations raise average
   customer spending and comparable store sales growth. The authors then
   show that employee job perceptions and performances "ripple thru the
   system" to affect customer spending and store sales growth. The authors
   offer implications for theory and practice.

AB Firms frequently position themselves as specialists. An implication of
   specialization is that the firm has forgone alternative opportunities.
   In the context of effort-intensive categories, we show that a firm can
   signal quality to consumers by specializing. In the model, a firm must
   decide to provide one service offering or to market two services. By
   entering a single category, the form incurs an opportunity cost of not
   entering the secondary pro. table category, but may attain reduced
   costs. The net cost is the signaling cost that a high-quality type firm
   incurs to signal quality over a low-quality type firm. We show that in
   homogenous markets, a high-quality type firm signals its high-quality
   type by specializing in one category. When consumers are heterogeneous,
   the firm can signal its high-quality type by using prices alone in both
   the primary and secondary categories. However, specialization can be
   used as a secondary signal of quality in heterogeneous markets because
   of lower signaling costs. We also find that signaling using
   specialization is more likely in the presence of competition.

AB This research models the dynamics of customer relationships using
   typical transaction data. Our proposed model permits not only capturing
   the dynamics of customer relationships, but also incorporating the
   effect of the sequence of customer-firm encounters on the dynamics of
   customer relationships and the subsequent buying behavior. Our approach
   to modeling relationship dynamics is structurally different from
   existing approaches. Specifically, we construct and estimate a
   nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model to model the transitions among latent
   relationship states and effects on buying behavior. In the proposed
   model, the transitions between the states are a function of time-varying
   covariates such as customer-firm encounters that could have an enduring
   impact by shifting the customer to a different (unobservable)
   relationship state. The proposed model enables marketers to dynamically
   segment their customer base and to examine methods by which the firm can
   alter long-term buying behavior. We use a hierarchical Bayes approach to
   capture the unobserved heterogeneity across customers. We calibrate the
   model in the context of alumni relations using a longitudinal
   gift-giving data set. Using the proposed model, we probabilistically
   classify the alumni base into three relationship states and estimate the
   effect of alumni-university interactions, such as reunions, on the
   movement of alumni between these states. Additionally, we demonstrate
   improved prediction ability on a hold-out sample.

AB In dyadic business relationships, parties can be incorrect in reading
   their counterparts' relational closeness. For example, they can
   overestimate or underestimate the counterpart's commitment to their
   relationship. In the business-to-business (B2B) literature, the
   consequences of such inaccurate perceptions have not been empirically
   investigated. We advance and test the proposition that the impact of
   misreading the other party's relational closeness depends on the
   direction of the error. We propose that overestimating the counterpart's
   relational closeness (CRC) is beneficial, while underestimating the
   counterpart's relational closeness is detrimental for the relationship's
   functioning. Using original dyadic data in the service sector, we show
   that most companies underestimate their CRC, in which case becoming
   perceptually more accurate would improve their relationships. But the
   opposite holds for parties that overestimate their CRC, in which case
   becoming perceptually more accurate would actually make the relationship
   deteriorate. Furthermore, we show that even in long-standing
   relationships, companies do not know how accurate their perceptions are,
   even when they believe that they correctly perceive their CRC. We
   discuss managerial implications of our findings and encourage future
   research to determine why most decision makers underestimate their CRC,
   which can lead to impaired functioning of B2B relationships.

   cross-category promotional spillovers are asymmetric between the two

   more to bacon price than to egg price. Promoting bacon is found to have
   a bigger impact on egg profit than the impact of egg promotion on bacon
   profit. We decompose (1) the total retail profits, as well as (2) the
   cross-category profit impact of a price promotion, into its two
   components, and find that (1) 23% (67%) of the total retail profit
   impact of a promotion on bacon (eggs) arises on account of quantity
   effects, and (2) 40% (33%) of the increase in egg (bacon) profit from
   promoting bacon (eggs) is on account of quantity effects.

AB Existing evidence suggests that preferences are affected by whether a
   price is presented as one all-inclusive expense or partitioned into a
   set of mandatory charges. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a new
   mechanism whereby price partitioning affects a consumer's perception of
   the secondary (i. e., nonfocal) benefits derived from a transaction.
   Four experiments support the hypothesis that a partitioned price
   increases the amount of attention paid to secondary attributes tagged
   with distinct price components. Characteristics of the offered secondary
   attributes such as their perceived value, relative importance, and
   evaluability can therefore determine whether price partitioning
   stimulates or hinders demand. Beyond its descriptive and prescriptive
   implications, this theory contributes to the emerging notion that
   pricing can transform, as well as capture, the utility of an offer.

AB We study two main questions in this paper: (1) How do spillovers of
   knowledge created by manufacturers' investments in process innovation
   affect channel structure and effort investment incentives? (2) What are
   the interactions between organizational incentives to form joint
   ventures and strategic alliances with competitors, and coordinate
   decisions vertically with downstream channel members? We focus on
   situations where spillovers are involuntary, firms' innovative
   activities are nonoverlapping, and firms benefit directly from the
   results of competitors' innovations. Under these conditions, we find
   that spillovers in process knowledge increase the likelihood of
   observing decentralized channel structures. Surprisingly, decentralized
   manufacturers invest more in process innovation than perfectly
   coordinated manufacturers do when spillovers are large. Moreover, in
   industries where large spillovers exist, horizontal cooperation among
   manufacturers induces higher levels of process innovation investments
   than channel coordination does. From a public policy perspective,
   however, the desirability of such cooperative arrangements among
   competitors depends on channel structure: joint ventures among
   decentralized manufacturers are more likely to meet the regulators'
   criteria of raising effort investments than cooperation among integrated
   manufacturers would be. Investment incentives are best provided when
   firms share their process knowledge and are buffered from subsequent
   price competition by independent retailers.

AB Registrars' offices at most universities face the daunting task of
   allocating course seats to students. Because demand exceeds supply for
   many courses, course allocation needs to be done equitably and
   efficiently. Many schools use bidding systems in which student bids are
   used both to infer preferences over courses and to determine student
   priorities for courses. However, this dual role of bids can result in
   course allocations not being market outcomes, and in unnecessary
   efficiency loss, which can potentially be avoided with the use of an
   appropriate market mechanism. We report the result of field and
   laboratory studies that compare a typical course-bidding mechanism with
   the alternate Gale-Shapley Pareto-dominant market mechanism. Results
   from the field study (conducted at the Ross School of Business,
   University of Michigan) suggest that using the latter could vastly
   improve efficiency of course allocation systems while facilitating
   market outcomes. Laboratory experiments with greater design control
   confirm the superior efficiency of the Gale-Shapley mechanism. The paper
   tests theory that has important practical implications because it has
   the potential to affect the learning experience of very large numbers of
   students enrolled in educational institutions.

   interchangeably at the online and the of line stores in the same grocery
   chain and investigate their purchase behavior in specific product
   categories. Although nearly 90% of households in our sample shop both at
   online and of line stores, we find that, across 12 vastly different

   when they shop online than when they shop offline. Our analysis accounts
   for observed and unobserved household heterogeneity as well as price
   endogeneity. The results hold for large basket-share categories and
   small basket-share categories, for consumer packaged goods and
   nonpackaged goods, for categories that are more likely to be purchased
   online because of their bulkiness or heaviness, and for categories that
   are more likely to be purchased offline because of their "sensory"
   nature. Households' price sensitivities are also closely related to
   demographics and inversely related to how far the households are located
   from the offline stores. Reasons for the lower price sensitivities in

   Like the independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property, IPS

   used to address the small sample issues that arise in the absence of
   pooling. Even though the unpooled results render our inferences for
   specific cross-brand pass-through magnitudes reported in BDG as
   imprecise, consistent with McAlister (2007), we do find significant
   empirical support for cross-brand pass-through.
   We next assess the sensitivity of cross-brand pass-through estimates to
   pooling. This requires us to construct a much longer time series of 224
   weeks for the refrigerated orange juice category, in contrast with the
   52-week samples used in BDG and McAlister (2007). We find strong
   empirical support for the predictive power of wholesale prices of
   substitute products for retail shelf prices. In addition, we find
   evidence of nonzero own-and cross-brand pass-through elasticities for
   which our inferences are much more precise. These findings are robust to
   the separation of regular and promotional price weeks. However, the
   magnitudes of own-brand and cross-brand pass-through are quite different
   during promotional and regular price weeks. Our results clearly show
   that with longer data series and more robust models that can handle
   small sample sizes, there is evidence of cross-brand pass-through,
   substantiating the findings in BDG. Finally, we comment on why our
   results are entirely consistent with both the theoretical and empirical
   literatures on category pricing and retailer behavior.

AB Prior behavioral research has suggested that advertising can influence a
   consumer's quality evaluation through informative and transformative
   effects. The informative effect acts directly to inform a consumer of
   product attributes and hence shapes her evaluations of brand quality.
   The transformative effect affects the consumer's evaluation of brand
   quality by enhancing her assessment of her subsequent consumption
   experience. In addition, advertising may influence a consumer's utility
   directly, even without providing any explicit information-this is the
   persuasive effect.
   In this paper, we propose a framework that formally models the processes
   through which all three effects of advertisements impact consumers'
   brand evaluations and their subsequent brand choice decisions. In
   particular, we model source credibility, confirmatory bias, and bounded
   rationality on the part of consumers, by appropriately modifying the
   standard Bayesian learning approach. Our model conforms closely to prior
   behavioral literature and the experimental findings therein. In our
   empirical analysis, we get significant estimates of both informative and
   transformative effects across brands. We find interesting temporal
   patterns across the effects; for instance, the importance of
   transformative effects seem to grow over time, while that of informative
   effects diminishes. Finally, we conduct policy experiments to examine
   the impact of increased ad intensity on advertising effects, as well as
   the role played by consumption ambiguity.

AB For marketers, television remains the most important advertising medium.
   This paper proposes a two-sided model of the television industry. We
   estimate viewer demand for programs on one side and advertiser demand
   for audiences on the other. The primary objective is to understand how
   each group's program usage influences the other group.
   Four main conclusions emerge. First, viewers tend to be averse to
   advertising. When a highly rated network decreases its advertising time
   by 10%, our model predicts a median audience gain of about 25% (assuming
   no competitive reactions). Second, we find the price elasticity of
   advertising demand is - 2.9, substantially more price elastic than 30
   years ago.
   Third, we compare our estimates of advertiser and viewer preferences for
   program characteristics to networks' observed program choices. Our
   results suggest that advertiser preferences influence network choices
   more strongly than viewer preferences. Viewers' two most preferred
   program genres, Action and News, account for just 16% of network program
   hours. Advertisers' two most preferred genres, Reality and Comedy,
   account for 47% of network program hours.
   Fourth, we perform a counterfactual experiment in which some viewers
   gain access to a hypothetical advertisement avoidance technology. The
   results suggest that ad avoidance tends to increase equilibrium
   advertising quantities and decrease network revenues.

AB How can a standardized product survive in a mass-customized world? This
   requires understanding that consumers often experience problems
   predicting their future hedonic reactions to new experiences (such as
   custom products), leading to feelings of regret. This form of regret
   occurs not because the custom product differs from specifications, but
   because consumers miswanted the design they ordered. Our analytic model
   shows that regret aversion induces consumers to design custom products
   to reflect the attributes of the available standard products.
   Consequently, regret-averse consumers may choose the standard product
   rather than place a custom order. The number of available standard
   products, however, moderates both these effects. Two experiments
   empirically substantiate the key predictions of the analytical model:
   (a) the custom product's resemblance to the standard product grows with
   regret aversion associated with miswanting, (b) there exists a segment
   of "regretfully loyal consumers" for the standard product in a
   mass-customized world and it expands with regret aversion, (c) both the
   above effects are weakened by the presence of a second standard product,
   and (d) the custom product can increase its market share when the number
   of standard products increases.

AB Switching marketing channels is an expensive and sticky decision. While
   a number of theories suggest efficiency and strategic differences
   between channels, there is virtually no work on combining these ideas
   into an empirically workable methodology to assess the impact of a
   channel switch. In this study, we undertake to close this gap with an
   empirical study of the sports drink market, featuring competing
   producers and heterogeneous channels.
   We estimate demand and cost parameters for a number of alternative
   models of competitive interaction and use these estimates to study the
   switching of Gatorade from its extant (independent wholesaler) channel
   to the direct store delivery (DSD) channel belonging to Pepsi.
   Our initial results indicate the following: Pepsi should switch Gatorade
   to the DSD channel only if (i) the switch decreases Gatorade's
   manufacturing cost by at least 14%, or (ii) the switch increases the
   share of profit it can obtain by at least 13%, or (iii) the switch
   enhances demand by the equivalent of a price cut of 4.96 cent for a
   32-ounces package. Absent these increases, Pepsi should not switch. Our
   methodology and results speak to both managers contemplating a channel
   switch and antitrust authorities faced with the task of evaluating the
   consequences of a change in vertical structure.

AB There is substantial literature documenting the presence of state-
   dependent utility with packaged goods data. Typically, a form of brand
   loyalty is detected whereby there is a higher probability of purchasing
   the same brand as has been purchased in the recent past. The economic
   significance of the measured loyalty remains an open question. We
   consider the category pricing problem and demonstrate that the presence
   of loyalty materially affects optimal pricing. The prices of higher
   quality products decline relative to those of lower quality when loyalty
   is introduced into the model. Given the well- known problems with the
   confounding of state dependence and consumer heterogeneity, loyalty must
   be measured in a model which allows for an unknown and possibly highly
   nonnormal distribution of heterogeneity. We implement a highly flexible
   model of heterogeneity using multivariate mixtures of normals in a
   hierarchical choice model. We use an Euler equations approach to the
   solution of the dynamic pricing problem which allows us to consider a
   very large number of consumer types.

   We compare three algorithms cluster classification, Bayesian treed

   sequence of questions and predict online visitors' preferences. In an
   empirical study, stepwise componential regression, relying on many fewer
   and easier-to-answer questions, achieved predictive accuracy equivalent

AB T his paper studies a model in which consumers search among multiple
   competing firms for products that match their preferences at a
   reasonable price. We focus on how easier search, possibly due to the
   adoption of search-facilitating technologies such as the Internet,
   influences equilibrium prices, assortments, firm profits, and consumer
   welfare. Conventional wisdom suggests that easier search creates a
   competition-intensifying effect that puts pressure on firms to lower
   their prices and reduce assortments. However, in our model we
   demonstrate that search also exhibits a market-expansion effect that
   encourages firms to expand their assortment-easier search means that
   each firm is searched by more consumers. Because of broader assortments,
   consumers are more likely to find products that better match their ideal
   preferences, improving the efficiency of the market. In fact, we
   demonstrate that the market-expansion effect can even dominate the
   competition-intensifying effect potentially leading to higher prices,
   broader assortments, more profits, and expanded welfare.

AB Firms often carry a portfolio of multiple brands within a product
   category to target different quality tiers in the market. Furthermore,
   to satisfy heterogeneous consumer preferences within each quality tier,
   these firms also offer several variants for each brand. A natural
   outcome of this practice is interbrand variant overlap that could occur
   across tiers or within a tier. In this paper, we show that across-tier
   variant overlap is likely to diminish the preference of an upper-tier
   brand and enhance the preference of a lower-tier brand. We also find
   that variant overlap within a tier is likely to increase preferences of
   a brand belonging to the tier. Such variant overlap effects have
   important brand portfolio management implications for a multibrand firm.
   Specifically, we demonstrate that such a firm can enhance its portfolio
   profit under certain conditions by pruning its variants to reduce
   variant overlap. Because our paper relies on aggregate data, future
   research should investigate variant overlap at the individual level
   using panel or experimental data.

   might be different. Four stylized cases are identified according to this
   difference: parallel, convergent, divergent, and
   convergent-then-divergent. In general, the optimal mechanism cannot be
   interpreted as a conventional second-price auction. A reserve price is
   imposed for each object. Depending on which of the four stylized cases
   is considered, a higher-value bidder may be allocated a higher-ranked or
   lower-ranked object. There is also a positive probability that a
   higher-ranked object is not allocated while a lower-ranked one is
   allocated. In a departure from the extant mechanism-design literature,
   the individual-rationality constraint for a mid-range type of bidder can
   be binding.

   impacts strategic interaction in distribution channels. In this paper,

   retailer facing a product market characterized by short product life,
   uncertain demand, and price rigidity. Assuming the firms have asymmetric
   information about the demand volatility, we examine the potential
   benefits of sharing information and contracts that facilitate such
   cooperation. We conclude that under a wholesale price regime,
   information sharing might not improve channel profits when the retailer
   underestimates the demand volatility but the manufacturer does not.
   Although information sharing is always beneficial under a two-part
   tariff regime, it is in general not sufficient to achieve sharing, and
   additional contractual arrangements are necessary. The contract types we
   consider to facilitate sharing are profit sharing and buyback contracts.

AB W e develop a consumer response model to evaluate and plan pricing and
   promotions in durable-good markets. We discuss its implementation in the
   U. S. automotive industry, which "spends" about $45 billion each year in
   price promotions. The approach is based on a random effects multinomial
   nested logit model of product (e. g., a vehicle model, such as Hyundai
   Tucson), and transaction-type choice. Transaction types include
   combinations of acquisition types (e. g., purchase versus lease) and
   pricing instruments (cash rebates, reduced APR financing, lease payment
   discounts). We estimate the model using hierarchical Bayes methods to
   capture response heterogeneity at the local market level. We find key
   characteristics unique to durable-good markets. First, consumers are
   heterogeneous in both their brand and transaction-type preferences.
   Second, consumers differ in their overall price sensitivity as well as
   in their relative sensitivity to alternative pricing instruments ( e.
   g., cash discounts, reduced monthly payments). Third, the most effective
   pricing programs tend to be those in which automakers offer consumers a
   menu of options to choose from ( e. g., a choice among a cash discount,
   reduced interest rate financing, or a lease payment discount). We
   illustrate the model through an empirical application to a sample of
   data drawn from J.D. Power transaction records in the entry SUV segment

AB We develop a robust model for estimating, tracking, and managing brand
   equity for multicategory brands based on customer survey and financial
   measures. This model has two components: (1) offering value (computed
   from discounted cash flow analysis) and (2) relative brand importance
   (computed from brand choice models such as multinomial logit,
   heteroscedastic extreme value, and mixed logit). We apply this model to
   estimate the brand equity of Allstate - a leading insurance company -
   and its leading competitor, which compete in multiple categories. The
   model captures the brand's spillover effects from one category to
   another. In addition, we identify the dimensions that drive a brand's
   image, examine the relationships among advertising, brand equity, and
   shareholder value, and build a decision support simulator for the focal
   brand. Our model provides reliable estimates of brand equity, and our
   results show that advertising has a strong long-term positive influence
   on brand equity, which is significantly positively related to
   shareholder value. The model, the brand equity estimates, and the
   decision support simulator are used by key executives across multiple
   functional areas and have enabled the company to substantially gain by
   reallocating its advertising resources to improve brand equity and
   shareholder value, and by offering better guidance to analysts and
   investors.

AB Customer management activities at firms involve making consistent
   decisions over time, about: (a) which customers to select for targeting,
   (b) determining the level of resources to be allocated to the selected
   customers, and (c) selecting customers to be nurtured to increase future
   profitability. Measurement of customer profitability and a deep
   understanding of the link between firm actions and customer
   profitability are critical for ensuring the success of the above
   decisions. We present the case study of how IBM used customer lifetime
   value (CLV) as an indicator of customer profitability and allocated
   marketing resources based on CLV. CLV was used as a criterion for
   determining the level of marketing contacts through direct mail,
   telesales, e-mail, and catalogs for each customer. In a pilot study
   implemented for about 35,000 customers, this approach led to
   reallocation of resources for about 14% of the customers as compared to
   the allocation rules used previously (which were based on past spending
   history). The CLV-based resource reallocation led to an increase in
   revenue of about $20 million (a tenfold increase) without any changes in
   the level of marketing investment. Overall, the successful
   implementation of the CLV-based approach resulted in increased
   productivity from marketing investments. We also discuss the
   organizational and implementation challenges that surrounded the
   adoption of CLV in this firm.

AB Tele.ring is a mobile phone organization selling contracts and cell
   phones in the Austrian market. The market situation in 2005 was highly
   competitive and dynamic, resulting in relatively short tariff life
   cycles. Excessively long lead times made tele. ring's management feel
   dissatisfied with their new tariff development process. Furthermore, a
   new competitor had entered the market, posing a major threat, and it was
   unclear how to effectively safeguard tele. ring's position in the
   market. In cooperation with the management, we implemented and tested a
   new segmentation, targeting, and positioning tool, which provides
   managers with information on their target markets, customer preferences,
   competitors' strengths, and customer segments. It allows for the
   simultaneous visualization of these data on a single map and facilitates
   timely and accurate decision making. In particular, we report on the
   design and the implementation of a new pricing scheme, "Formel 10,"
   which became the most successful new tariff introduction in this
   competitive market. tele. ring's managers were very much impressed with
   our tool's ability to represent the market on a single map and with its
   capacity to allow for intuitive interpretation. In addition, the tool
   enhanced internal communication between its users and different
   stakeholders during the new tariff development process.

AB In recent years, the issue of copyright protection for intellectual
   properties such as computer software, music CDs, and videos has become
   increasingly important. It is often claimed that illegal copying of
   intellectual property costs companies billions of dollars in lost
   revenues and reduces firms' incentives to innovate. Some researchers
   have shown that copying can be beneficial to firms when there are strong
   network effects and copying expands the market. In this paper, we first
   examine the impact of illegal copying of software and other similar
   intellectual properties on firms' prices, profits, and quality choices,
   even when there are no network effects and the market is saturated. We
   show that contrary to the claims of manufacturers, there are conditions
   under which copying can increase firms' profits, lead to better quality
   products, and increase social welfare. This is because weaker copyright
   protection enables firms to reduce price competition by allowing
   price-sensitive consumers to copy. Thus, weaker copyright protection can
   serve as a coordination device to reduce price competition. We also
   examine how equilibrium copyright enforcement is affected by network
   externalities. In contrast to previous research, we show that strong
   network effects can sometimes lead to a firm choosing higher levels of
   copyright protection. Our results show that in the presence of strong
   network effects, stronger copyright enforcement by one firm can serve as
   a coordinating device to reduce price competition.

AB The motion picture industry is characterized by a dynamic market
   environment, limited shelf space and product category management, and
   consequently, complex channel contracts specifying the split of box
   office revenue between distributors and exhibitors. Although such a
   contracting practice creates a considerable administrative effort and
   channel conflict, it is not clear whether such complexity is necessary
   for superior channel performance. This study investigates this question
   by analyzing the impact of movie contract structure on movie scheduling
   and channel member profitability. We develop and analyze a
   game-theoretic model using the genetic algorithm approach and a decision
   support system, SilverScreener, to capture strategic behaviors of
   channel members in a complex market environment. We find that simpler
   two-part tariff or 50/50 split contracts perform as well as the current
   contracts. Thus, the complexity of the market environment need not be
   reflected in the complexity of the channel contracts. Channel contract
   structure has significant impact on channel member profitability and the
   exhibitor's movie-scheduling behavior. In particular, our results
   indicate that the. at rate contract structure represents an attractive
   alternative to the current practice for distributors.

AB While retailers have sales data to forecast demand, manufacturers have a
   broad understanding of the market and the coming trends. It is well
   known that pooling such demand information within a distribution channel
   improves supply chain logistics. However, little is known about how
   information-sharing affects wholesale pricing incentives. In this paper,
   we investigate a channel structure where a manufacturer and two
   retailers have private signals of the state of the demand. Our model
   identifies the presence of a pricing distortion, which we term the
   inference effect, when a manufacturer sets price to an uninformed
   retailer. Because of this inference effect, the manufacturer would like
   to set a low wholesale price to signal to the retailer that the demand
   is low. On the other hand, the manufacturer would like to set a high
   wholesale price so that he earns the optimal margin on each unit sold.
   Vertical information sharing benefits the manufacturer by eliminating
   the distortion caused by the inference effect, which is more profound in
   a channel whose retailer has a noisier signal. This result implies that
   when there is a cost associated with transmitting information, the
   manufacturer may choose to share information with only the less-informed
   retailer rather than with both.

AB Firms often use a pool or series of advertising themes in their
   campaigns. Thus, for example, a firm may employ some of its advertising
   to promote price-related themes or messages and other of its advertising
   to promote product-related themes. This study examines the
   interdependence that can occur between pairs of themes in a pool (i.e.,
   pooling effects), the impact of these pooling effects on the allocation
   of advertising expenditures, and the factors that can affect forgetting
   rates (or, conversely, carry-over rates) in a multitheme advertising
   environment. The study measures pooling, wear out, and forgetting
   (carry-over) effects for a campaign that uses five different advertising
   themes. To obtain these measures, I extend the linear Nerlove-Arrow (NA)
   (1962) model to a nonlinear model of advertising theme quality and
   goodwill and estimate the extended model using Markov chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) and particle filtering ideas. Particle filtering belongs to a
   class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods designed to estimate
   nonlinear/nonnormal state space models. Results show that forgetting (or
   carry-over) rates may be time varying and a function of prior goodwill
   (past advertising) and other advertising variables. Results show,
   moreover, that pooling effects can reduce theme wear out and, in turn,
   significantly improve advertising efficiency.

AB T his paper defines a unique type of product or service offering, termed
   probabilistic goods, and analyzes a novel selling strategy, termed
   probabilistic selling (PS). A probabilistic good is not a concrete
   product or service but an offer involving a probability of getting any
   one of a set of multiple distinct items. Under the probabilistic selling
   strategy, a multi-item seller creates probabilistic goods using the
   existing distinct products or services and offers such probabilistic
   goods as additional purchase choices. The probabilistic selling strategy
   allows sellers to benefit from introducing a new type of buyer
   uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in product assignments. First,
   introducing such uncertainty enables sellers to create a "virtual"
   product or service (i.e., probabilistic good), which opens up a creative
   way to segment a market. We find that the probabilistic selling strategy
   is a general marketing tool that has the potential to benefit sellers in
   many different industries. Second, this paper shows that creating buyer
   uncertainty in product assignments is a new way for sellers to deal with
   their own market uncertainty. We illustrate two such benefits: (a)
   offering probabilistic goods can reduce the seller's information
   disadvantage and lessen the negative effect of demand uncertainty on
   profit, and (b) offering probabilistic goods can solve the mismatch
   between capacity and demand and enhance efficiency. Emerging technology
   is creating exciting (previously unfeasible) opportunities to implement
   PS and to obtain these many advantages.

AB Existing literature discusses a number of possible pioneering cost
   advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we empirically test three
   different sources of long-term pioneering cost advantage - experience
   curve effects, preemption of input factors, and preemption of ideal
   market space - and three different sources of pioneering cost
   disadvantage - imitation, vintage effects, and demand orientation. We
   disentangle these sources by breaking total cost of a business unit into
   three different components - purchasing, production, and selling,
   general, and administrative (SG&A) costs - and identifying conditions
   that intensify or reduce the effect of the proposed source. Using two
   samples of business units, one for consumer goods and one for industrial
   goods, we find support for five of the six sources of pioneering cost
   advantage and disadvantage in both samples, while the advantage due to
   preemption of ideal market space is limited to the consumer goods
   sample. The unconditional analysis shows a pioneering purchasing cost
   advantage but even larger pioneering production and SG&A cost
   disadvantages. The complexity of our obtained findings suggests that
   managers need to think carefully about their particular conditions
   before making assumptions about the cost and, therefore, profit
   implications of a pioneering strategy.

AB Co-branding is often used by companies to reinforce the image of their
   brands. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which a
   brand's image is reinforced or impaired as a result of co-branding, and
   the characteristics of a good partner for a firm considering co-branding
   for image reinforcement. We address these issues by conceptualizing
   attribute beliefs as two-dimensional constructs: The first dimension
   reflects the expected value of the attribute, while the second dimension
   reflects the degree of certainty about the attribute. We argue that
   these parameters are updated after consumers are exposed to a
   co-branding activity, and we develop an analytical model that
   incorporates these notions. An analysis of the model leads to several
   propositions, which we test in an experiment. Our findings indicate that
   it is not necessarily in a brand's best interest to choose an alliance
   partner that is of the highest performance possible. Moreover, we find
   that, while expected values of the brand attributes may improve as a
   result of co-branding, under certain conditions the uncertainty
   associated with the brands increases through the alliance. Implications
   for co-branding researchers and practitioners are discussed.

AB A contract with K-class pricing divides a large set of goods or services
   into K classes and assigns a single price to any element of a class.
   While the literature has emphasized rationales based on screening, this
   paper looks at the implications of costly pricing. My analysis suggests
   that class pricing is more likely to be used when the number of buyers
   is smaller, the number of versions is larger, the variance in costs is
   smaller, and demand ex ante differs less between versions. Under simple
   conditions classes should be designed to minimize the sum of squared
   within-class cost deviations. In bilateral trades, the most efficient
   game form is that in which classes are designed by the player with fewer
   varied gains from trade, while the traded version is chosen by the other
   player. Decisions are thus made by the player who cares most about them,
   while the opponent prescribes a set of limits.

AB We model the commercial World Wide Web as a directed graph that emerges
   as the equilibrium of a game in which utility maximizing websites
   purchase (advertising) in- links from each other while also setting the
   price of these links. In equilibrium, higher content sites tend to
   purchase more advertising links (mirroring the Dorfman- Steiner rule)
   while selling less advertising links themselves. As such, there seems to
   be specialization across sites in revenue models: high content sites
   tend to earn revenue from the sales of content, whereas low content ones
   earn revenue from the sales of traffic (advertising). In an extension,
   we also allow sites to establish (reference) out- links to each other
   and find that there is a general tendency to establish reference links
   to sites with higher content. Finally, we explore network formation in
   the presence of search engines and find that the higher the proportion
   of people using them, the more sites have an incentive to specialize in
   certain content areas. Our results have interesting practical
   implications for search- engine optimization, the pricing of online
   advertising, and the choice of Internet business models. They also shed
   light on why Google can use the web's link structure to rank sites by

AB Critics have long faulted the wide-spread practice of trade promotions
   as wasteful. It has been estimated that this practice adds up to $ 100
   billion worth of inventory to the distribution system. Yet, the practice
   continues. In this paper, we propose a price discrimination model of
   trade promotions. We show that in a distribution channel characterized
   by a dominant retailer, a manufacturer has incentives to price
   discriminate between the dominant retailer and smaller independents.
   While offering all retailers the same pricing policy, price
   discrimination can be implemented through trade promotions because they
   induce different inventory-ordering behaviors on the part of retailers.
   Differences in inventory holding costs have been shown to be an
   important determinant of consumer promotions. Our analysis suggests that
   differences in holding costs are also potentially an important driver
   for the use of trade promotions. The implications from our model explain
   a number of anecdotal and/or empirically observed puzzles about how
   trade promotions are practiced. For example, our analysis explains why
   chain stores welcome trade promotions but independents do not. Our
   analysis outlines implications for managing trade promotions.

AB There is strong evidence that consumers learn from their brand
   consumption experiences and continuously update their brand purchase
   probabilities. However, in explaining why established competitive brands
   continuously compete through periodic price promotions, most of the
   existing theories do not attribute this phenomenon to underlying
   consumer learning. Yet, " try it, you will like it" is often the stated
   rationale of the practicing marketing manager in offering consumers a
   price promotion on a brand. This paper examines the connection between
   consumer learning and the offering of price promotions. The consumer
   model specified is Markovian in nature and encompasses in addition to
   consumer learning other empirical findings such as the increase in
   product class consumption in response to price reductions. The consumer
   models used in the existing game theoretic approaches to this problem
   are shown to be mostly special cases of the proposed model. It is
   demonstrated that for the commonly used price response functions the
   existence of consumer learning, at a level of intensity consistent with
   that identified in empirical works, makes it optimal for competing
   brands to periodically offer price promotions. Moreover, it is shown
   that the competing brands should promote in different periods as opposed
   to head to head.

AB Most supermarket firms choose to position themselves by offering either
   everyday low prices (EDLP) across several items or offering temporary
   price reductions (promotions) on a limited range of items. While this
   choice has been addressed from a theoretical perspective in both the
   marketing and economic literature, relatively little is known about how
   these decisions are made in practice, especially within a competitive
   environment. This paper exploits a unique store level data set
   consisting of every supermarket operating in the United States in 1998.
   For each of these stores, we observe the pricing strategy the firm has
   chosen to follow, as reported by the firm itself. Using a system of
   simultaneous discrete choice models, we estimate each store's choice of
   pricing strategy as a static discrete game of incomplete information. In
   contrast to the predictions of the theoretical literature, we find
   strong evidence that firms cluster by strategy by choosing actions that
   agree with those of its rivals. We also find a significant impact of
   various demographic and store/chain characteristics, providing some
   qualified support for several specific predictions from marketing
   theory.

AB Two widely recognized components, central to the calculation of customer
   value, are acquisition and retention propensities. However, while extant
   research has incorporated such components into different types of
   models, limited work has investigated the kinds of associations that may
   exist between them. In this research, we focus on the relationship
   between a prospective customer's time until acquisition of a particular
   service and the subsequent duration for which he retains it, and examine
   the implications of this relationship on the value of prospects and
   customers.
   To accomplish these tasks, we use a bivariate timing model to capture
   the relationship between acquisition and retention. Using a split-hazard
   model, we link the acquisition and retention processes in two distinct
   yet complementary ways. First, we use the Sarmonov family of bivariate
   distributions to allow for correlations in the observed acquisition and
   retention times within a customer; next, we allow for differences across
   customers using latent classes for the parameters that govern the two
   processes. We then demonstrate how the proposed methodology can be used
   to calculate the discounted expected value of a subscription based on
   the time of acquisition, and discuss possible applications of the
   modeling framework to problems such as customer targeting and resource
   allocation.

AB With $40 billion in annual gross merchandise volume, electronic auctions
   comprise a substantial and growing sector of the retail economy. Using
   unique data on Celtic coins, we estimate a structural model of buyer and
   seller behavior via Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC) with data
   augmentation. Results indicate that buyer valuations are affected by
   item, seller, and auction characteristics; buyer costs are affected by
   bidding behavior; and seller costs are affected by item characteristics
   and the number of listings. The model enables us to compute fee
   elasticities even though there is no variation in fees in our data. We
   find that commission elasticities exceed per item fee elasticities
   because they target high-value sellers and enhance their likelihood of
   listing. By targeting commission reductions to high-value sellers,
   auction house revenues can be increased by 3.9%. Computing customer
   value, we find that attrition of the largest seller would decrease fees
   paid to the auction house by $ 97. Given the seller paid $ 127 in fees,
   competitive effects offset only 24% of those fees. In contrast,
   competition offsets 81% of the buyer attrition effect. In both events,
   the auction house would overvalue its customers by neglecting
   competitive effects.

AB Multinational corporations (MNCs) often pursue global strategies that
   emphasize efficiency, flexibility, and learning, but globally developed
   strategies often clash with the environmental idiosyncrasies of MNC
   country subsidiary markets in which the strategy is actually
   implemented. Extant research pays little attention to the contingent
   efficacy of such global strategies from the perspective of MNC country
   subsidiary markets. We adopt the strategy-environment alignment
   principle and study how host country task-and institutional environments
   might influence the efficacy of global strategies for MNC subsidiary
   performance. We assess MNC subsidiary performance using subjective
   managerial judgments, and on the basis of recent research on human
   judgments, we theorize that these judgments embody information about
   judgment magnitude and uncertainty. A mean- variance function model
   simultaneously teases out the effects of the explanatory variables on
   the magnitude and uncertainty of MNC subsidiary performance judgments.
   To test the hypotheses, we analyze survey data from German and Japanese
   subsidiaries in the United States. The results support the use of the
   meanvariance function model and specific theory about the antecedents of
   performance judgment magnitude and uncertainty. Findings pertaining to
   interactions between global strategies and the facets of the local
   country environment reveal ways in which MNCs can adapt " global"
   strategies to navigate the complex array of country markets they face.

AB In several marketing contexts, strategic complementarity between the

   decisions to reach efficient outcomes. Yet coordination failure is a
   common occurrence. We show that the well-established psychological
   phenomenon of asymmetric dominance can facilitate coordination in two
   experiments. Thus, we demonstrate a counterintuitive result: A common
   bias in individual decision making can help players to coordinate their
   decisions to obtain efficient outcomes. Further, limited steps of
   thinking alone cannot account for the observed asymmetric dominance
   effect. The effect appears to be due to increased psychological
   attractiveness of the dominating strategy, with our estimates of the
   incremental attractiveness ranging from 3%-6%. A learning analysis

AB Brand salience-the extent to which a brand visually stands out from its
   competitors-is vital in competing on the shelf, yet is not easy to
   achieve in practice. This study proposes a methodology to determine the
   competitive salience of brands, based on a model of visual search and
   eye-movement recordings collected during a brand search experiment. We
   estimate brand salience at the point of purchase, based on perceptual
   features (color, luminance, edges) and how these are influenced by
   consumers' search goals. We show that the salience of brands has a
   pervasive effect on search performance, and is determined by two key
   components: The bottom-up component is due to in-store activity and
   package design. The top-down component is due to out-of-store marketing
   activities such as advertising. We show that about one-third of salience
   on the shelf is due to out-of-store and two-thirds due to in-store
   marketing. The proposed methodology for competitive salience analysis
   exposes the optimal visual differentiation level of a brand versus its
   competitors, and of each SKU versus the other SKUs of the same brand.
   The model of the visual search process and methodology for competitive
   salience analysis enable diagnostic analyses of the current levels of
   visual differentiation of brands and SKUs at the point of purchase, and
   provide directions for increasing these.

AB Reference groups influence product and brand evaluations, especially
   when the product is a publicly consumed luxury good. Marketers of such
   luxury goods need to carefully balance two important social forces: (1)
   the desire of leaders to distinguish themselves from followers and (2)
   the countervailing desire of followers to assimilate with leaders. In
   this paper, we examine the theoretical implications of these social
   forces for firm prices, product design, and target consumer selection.
   We show that the presence of reference group effects can motivate firms
   to add costly features, which provide limited or no functional benefit
   to consumers. Furthermore, reference group effects can induce product
   proliferation on one hand and motivate firms to offer limited editions
   on the other hand. We find that offering a limited edition can increase
   sales and profits. In some cases, reference group effects can even lead
   to a buying frenzy.

AB Online reverse auctions generate real-time bidding data that could be
   used via appropriate statistical estimation to assist the corporate
   buyer's procurement decision. To this end, we develop a method, called
   BidAnalyzer, which estimates dynamic bidding models and selects the most
   appropriate of them. Specifically, we enable model estimation by
   addressing the problem of partial observability; i.e., only one of N
   suppliers' bids is realized, and the other (N - 1) bids remain
   unobserved. To address partial observability, BidAnalyzer estimates the
   latent price distributions of bidders by applying the Kalman filtering
   theory. In addition, BidAnalyzer conducts model selection by applying
   multiple information criteria. Using empirical data from an automotive
   parts auction, we illustrate the application of BidAnalyzer by
   estimating several dynamic bidding models to obtain empirical insights,
   retaining a model for forecasting, and assessing its predictive
   performance in out-of-sample. The resulting one-step-ahead price
   forecast is accurate up to 2.95% median absolute percentage error.
   Finally, we suggest how BidAnalyzer can serve as a device for price
   discovery in online reverse auctions.

AB The two main influences leading to adoption at the individual consumer
   level are marketing communication and interpersonal communication.
   Although evidence of the effect of these two influences is abundant at
   the market level, there is a paucity of research documenting the
   simultaneous effect of both influences at the individual consumer level.
   Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to fill the gap in the
   literature by documenting the existence and magnitude of both influences
   at the individual customer level while controlling for unobserved
   temporal effects.
   The pharmaceutical industry provides an appropriate context to study
   this problem. It has been conjectured that adoption and usage patterns
   of a new drug by physicians-"contagion"-acts as a "consumption
   externality," as it allows a given physician to learn about the efficacy
   and use of the drug. In addition, pharmaceutical companies target
   individual physicians via marketing activities such as detailing,
   sampling, and direct-to-consumer advertising. Our data contain the
   launch of a new drug from an important drug category. We chose two
   unrelated markets (Manhattan and Indianapolis) for our empirical
   analysis. We model an individual physician's decision to adopt a new
   drug in a given time period as a binary choice decision. This decision
   is modeled as a function of temporal trends (linear and quadratic) and
   individual physician-level contagion and marketing activity ( both
   individual level and market level). Our contagion measure aggregates the
   adoption behavior of geographically near physicians for each physician
   in our sample.
   Our results from the Manhattan market indicate that both targeted
   communication and contagion have an effect on the individual physician's
   adoption decision. A major challenge is to rule out alternative
   explanations for the detected contagion effect. We therefore carry out a
   series of tests and show that this effect persists even after we control
   for the effects of time, individual salespeople, other marketing
   instruments, local market effects, and the effects of some institutional
   factors. We believe that our contagion effect arises because the
   consumption externality is stronger for geographically close physicians.
   We discuss some underlying processes that are probably giving rise to
   the contagion effect we detected.
   Finally, we compute the social multiplier of marketing and find it to be
   about 11%. We also use the estimated parameters to compare the relative
   effect of contagion and targeted marketing. We. nd that marketing plays
   a large (relative) role in affecting early adoption. However, the role
   of contagion dominates from month 4 onward and, by month 17 (or about
   half the duration of our data), asymptotes to about 90% of the effect.

AB With advances in technology, the collection of information from
   consumers at the time of purchase is common in many categories. This
   information allows a firm to straightforwardly classify consumers as
   either "new" or "past" consumers. This opens the door for firms to
   implement marketing that (a) discriminates between new and past
   consumers and (b) entails making offers to them that are significantly
   different. Our objective is to examine the competitive effects of
   marketing that tailors offers to consumers based on their past buying
   behavior. In a two-period model with two competing firms, we assume that
   each firm is able to commit about whether or not to implement
   behavior-based discrimination (BBD), i.e., to add benefits to its offer
   for past consumers in the second period. When the firms are identical in
   their ability to add value to the second-period offer, BBD generally
   leads to lower profits for both firms. Past customers are so valuable in
   the second period that BBD leads to cutthroat competition in the first
   period. As a result, the payoffs associated with the implementation of
   BBD form a prisoner's dilemma. Interestingly, when a firm has a
   significant advantage over its competitor (one firm has the capability
   to add more benefits for its past customers than the other), it can
   increase its profit versus the base case even when there is significant
   competition in the second period. Moreover, the firm at a disadvantage
   sometimes finds that the best response to BBD by a strong competitor is
   to respond with a uniform price and avoid the practice completely.

AB Choice-based conjoint analysis is a popular marketing research technique
   to learn about consumers' preferences and to make market share forecasts
   under various scenarios for product offerings. Managers expect these
   forecasts to be "realistic" in terms of being able to replicate market
   shares at some prespecified or "basecase" scenario. Frequently, there is
   a discrepancy between the recovered and base- case market share. This
   paper presents a Bayesian decision theoretic approach to incorporating
   base- case market shares into conjoint analysis via the loss function.
   Because de. ning the base-case scenario typically involves a variety of
   management decisions, we treat the market shares as constraints on what
   are acceptable answers, as opposed to informative prior information. Our
   approach seeks to minimize the adjustment of parameters by using
   additive factors from a normal distribution centered at 0, with a
   variance as small as possible, but such that the market share
   constraints are satisfied. We specify an appropriate loss function, and
   all estimates are formally derived via minimizing the posterior expected
   loss. We detail algorithms that provide posterior distributions of
   constrained and unconstrained parameters and quantities of interest. The
   methods are demonstrated using discrete choice models with simulated
   data and data from a commercial market research study. These studies
   indicate that the method recovers base- case market shares without
   systematically distorting the preference structure from the conjoint
   experiment.

AB This paper studies the pricing problem of a durable-goods monopolist. It
   finds that contrary to the existing literature, profits from selling
   durable goods might be higher than from leasing when the products
   exhibit network effects. Under the influence of network effects, there
   exist multiple self-fulfilling equilibria that would sustain different
   network sizes at the same price. By using the assumption that consumers
   are cautious about network growth, we find that consumption
   externalities among heterogeneous groups of consumers generate a
   discontinuous demand function, which requires a lessor to offer a low
   price if she wants to reach the mass market. In contrast, a seller
   enjoys a relative advantage in that she can build a customer base by
   setting a lower initial price and raise the price later in the mass
   market. Our finding that selling can be more pro. table than leasing
   holds when consumers are more cautious about the prospect of the
   product's success, which might be the case if, for example, the
   technology or manufacturer is relatively unknown.

   concentration in the auto rental industry. We assemble an original
   database that includes the number of auto rental operators and other
   exogenous demand and cost conditions at every commercial airport in the
   country. The data are interesting because we observe a large variation
   in market structure, ranging from more than 100 monopoly and duopoly
   markets to several competitive airports with more than eight firms. In
   addition, we collect daily rental prices in each market that are
   regressed against the number of operating firms and other control
   factors. Due to potential biases in treating market participants as
   exogenously assigned, we employ a two-stage estimation procedure in
   which an equilibrium model of endogenous market structure provides
   correction terms for the second-stage price regression. Results show
   that ignoring the endogeneity of market structure severely
   underestimates the impact of additional competitors on prices, with the
   competitive interaction parameters doubling in magnitude after the
   correction procedure. The downward bias in the competitive parameter can
   have important implications for horizontal mergers, which may
   incorrectly appear innocuous when using a model that ignores the
   endogeneity of market structure. More generally, our results serve as a
   warning on the potential biases to a large number of applications in
   marketing and economics that attempt to relate outcome variables such as
   prices, markups, or profits to the observed market structure.

   performance to firms' postlaunch marketing choices. We decompose the
   success of a new brand into its ultimate market potential and the rate
   at which it achieves this potential. To achieve this aim we formulate a

   growth and market potential are directly linked to the new brand's
   long-term advertising, promotion, distribution, and product strategy. We
   perform the analysis on 225 new-brand introductions across 22
   repeat-purchase product categories over five years to develop
   generalized findings about the correlates of new-brand success. We find
   that access to distribution breadth plays the greatest role in the
   success of a new brand, and that investments in distribution and product
   innovation lead to greater marginal increases in sales for new brands
   than either discounting, feature/display, or advertising. Moreover,
   distribution interacts with other strategies to enhance their
   effectiveness. These findings underscore the utility of extending
   marketing mix models of new-brand performance to include product and
   distribution decisions.

AB e study the dissociation between two common measures of value-monetary
   assessment of purchase options versus the predicted utility associated
   with owning or consuming those options, a disparity that is reflected in
   well-known judgment anomalies and that is important for interpreting
   market research data. We propose that a significant cause of this
   dissociation is the difference in how these two types of evaluations are
   formed-each is informed by different types of information. Thus,
   dissociation between these two types of measures should not be
   interpreted as failure to map utility onto money, as such mapping is not
   really attempted. We suggest that monetary assessment tends to focus on
   the transaction in which the purchase alternative would be acquired or
   forgone (e.g., how fair the transaction seems), failing to adequately
   reflect the purchase alternative itself (e.g., the expected pleasure of
   owning or consuming it), which is what informs predicted utility
   judgments. We illustrate the value of this idea by deriving and testing
   empirical predictions of disparities in the impact of different types of
   information and manipulations on the two types of value assessment.

AB In this paper, we propose and operationalize a new method for optimizing
   shelf arrangements. We show that there are important dependencies
   between the layout of the shelf and stock-keeping unit (SKU) sales and
   marketing effectiveness. The importance of these dependencies is further
   shown by the substantive profit gains we obtain with our proposed shelf
   optimization approach. The basis of our model is a standard sales
   equation that explains sales using item-specific marketing effect
   parameters and intercepts. In a Hierarchical Bayes (HB) fashion, we
   augment this model with a second layer that relates the effect
   parameters to shelf and SKU descriptors. We also take into account
   potential endogeneity of facings. After estimating the parameters of the
   two-level model using Bayesian methodology, we carefully investigate the
   dependencies of SKU sales and SKU marketing effectiveness on the shelf
   layout. Next, we search for the shelf arrangement that maximizes the
   expected total profit using simulated annealing (SA). We appear to be
   able to increase profits for all the stores analyzed, and our approach
   appears to outperform well-known rules of thumb.

AB We investigate biases in product valuation and usage decisions that
   arise when consumers consider a new generation of a product that offers
   an expanded set of capabilities of uncertain value. Two experiments
   using a novel computer game show evidence of a valuation-usage
   disparity: Participants display a high willingness to pay for a new
   version of the game that offers a new set of controls, but fail to fully
   exercise the option to use these controls after purchase. This
   discrepancy is attributed to a fundamental difference in how new
   capabilities are valued at the time of purchase versus use. Consumer
   usage decisions appear to be driven by such myopic concerns as a desire
   to avoid short-term learning costs, whereas purchase decisions often
   fail to take into account the factors that drive usage, and are further
   inflated by global optimism in the future usefulness of new
   capabilities. We show that this lack of foresight can be explained by an
   intertemporal judgment model in which consumers attempt to value the
   option to use new capabilities as would be prescribed by economic
   theory, but are prone to hyperbolic discounting in their temporal
   valuation of present versus future costs and benefits.

AB When a DVD title is announced prior to actual distribution, consumers
   can often preorder the title and receive it as soon as it is released.
   Alternatively, once a title becomes available (i.e., formally released),
   consumers can obtain it upon purchase with minimal delay. We propose an
   individual-level behavioral model that captures the aggregate
   preorder/postrelease sales of motion picture DVDs. Our model is based on
   an optimal stopping framework. Starting with the utility function of a
   forward-looking consumer, and allowing for consumer heterogeneity, we
   derive the aggregate preorder/postrelease sales distribution. Even under
   a parsimonious specification for the heterogeneity distribution, our
   model recovers the typically observed temporal pattern of DVD preorder
   and sales, a pattern which exhibits an exponentially increasing number
   of preorder units before the release, peaks at release, and drops
   exponentially afterward. Using data provided by a major Internet DVD
   retailer, we demonstrate a number of important managerial implications
   stemming from our model. We investigate the role of preorder timing
   through a policy experiment, estimate residual sales, and forecast
   post-release sales based only on preorder information. We show that our
   model has substantially better predictive validity than benchmark
   models.

   prices and advertising signal brand quality. Four quality signaling
   mechanisms are at work: (1) price signals quality, (2) advertising
   frequency signals quality, (3) advertising content provides direct (but
   noisy) information about quality, and (4) use experience provides direct
   (but noisy) information about quality. We estimate our proposed model
   using scanner panel data on ketchup. If price is important as a signal
   of brand quality, then frequent price promotion may have the unintended
   consequence of reducing brand equity. We use our estimated model to
   measure the importance of such effects. Our results imply that price is
   an important quality-signaling mechanism and that frequent price cuts
   can have significant adverse effects on brand equity. The role of
   advertising frequency in signaling quality is also significant, but it
   is less quantitatively important than price.

AB This paper develops a model that extends the traditional aggregate
   discrete-choice-based demand model (e.g. Berry et al. 1995) to account
   for varying levels of product availability. In cases where not all
   products are available at every consumer shopping trip, the observed
   market share is a convolution of two factors: consumer preferences and
   the availability of the product in stores. Failing to account for the
   varying degree of availability would produce incorrect estimates of the
   demand parameters. The proposed model uses information on aggregate
   availability to simulate the potential assortments that consumers may
   face in a given shopping trip. The model parameters are estimated by
   simulating potential product assortment vectors by drawing multivariate
   Bernoulli vectors consistent with the observed aggregate level of
   availability. The model is applied to the UK chocolate confectionery
   market, focusing on the convenience store channel. We compare the
   parameter estimates to those obtained from not accounting for varying
   availability and analyze some of the substantive implications.

AB In mature markets with competing firms, a common role for advertising is
   to shift consumer preferences towards the advertiser in a tug-of-war,
   with no effect on category demand. In this paper, we analyze the effect
   of such "combative" advertising on market power. We show that, depending
   on the nature of consumer response, combative advertising can reduce
   price competition to benefit competing firms. However, it can also lead
   to a procompetitive outcome where individual firms advertise to increase
   their own profitability, but collectively become worse off. This is
   because combative advertising can intensify price competition such that
   an "advertising war" leads to a "price war." Similar to price
   competition, advertising competition can result in a prisoner's dilemma
   where all competing firms make less profit even when the effect of each
   firm's advertising is to enhance consumer preferences in its favor.
   Given such procompetitive effects, we further show that cost of
   combative advertising could be a blessing in disguise-higher unit cost
   of advertising resulting in lower equilibrium levels of advertising,
   leading to higher prices and profits. We conduct a laboratory experiment
   to investigate how combative advertising by competing brands influences
   consumer preferences. Our experimental analysis offers strong support
   for our conclusions.

AB Media firms compete in two connected markets. They face rivalry for the
   sale of content to consumers, and at the same time, they compete for
   advertisers seeking access to the attention of these consumers. We
   explore the implications of such two-sided competition on the actions
   and source of profits of media firms. One main conclusion we reach is
   that media firms may charge higher content prices in a duopoly than in a
   monopoly. This happens because competition for advertisers can reduce
   the return per customer impression from the ad market, making each firm
   less willing to underprice content to increase demand. Greater
   competitive intensity may thus increase content profits and decrease ad
   profits. These findings are in sharp contrast to those in a regular
   one-sided product market, in which competition typically lowers product
   prices and profits. We extend the framework to examine competition
   across different media (e. g., between magazines and cable TV) and show
   that firms in a duopolistic medium may benefit from more intense
   competition from a monopolist in another medium. We characterize the
   conditions for each firm in the duopoly medium to bundle more ads and
   earn greater total profits than the rival firm in the monopoly medium.

AB An important role of informative advertising is to inform consumers of
   the simple fact that the shop that advertises sells a particular
   product. This information may help consumers to save on their search
   activities: instead of wandering around, a consumer can simply visit the
   shop that has advertised, knowing that there he can find the commodity
   he is looking for. The implications of this simple fact have not been
   studied before. Using game theoretic reasoning in a model that combines
   consumer search and firms' advertising we show that firms may find it
   optimal to advertise prices that are higher than nonadvertised prices.
   The important mechanism underlying this result is that advertising
   lowers the expected search cost for consumers. Through this analysis we

   We further decompose the value of a warranty into its insurance value
   and its price discrimination value, which are the two main rationales
   for warranty provision in the server market. We use structural modeling
   and counterfactual experiments to accomplish the empirical task. We
   derive our demand model from utility maximization, which accounts for a
   customer's risk aversion behavior and heterogeneity. We obtain our
   pricing model from the profit maximization behavior of manufacturers and
   downstream firms in indirect channels, accounting for the institutional
   realities in the server market. Our empirical analysis uses quarterly
   data from 1999 to 2004 on server wholesale prices, retail prices, and
   sales for direct and indirect channels in the U. S. market. We find that
   manufacturers and downstream firms benefit from warranty provision and
   from sorting across heterogeneous customers by offering a menu of
   warranties. Customers also benefit from manufacturer warranty provision
   as well as from the menu of warranties offered. The insurance value of
   warranties increases and the price discrimination value of warranties

AB Random effects or mixed logit models are often used to model differences
   in consumer preferences. Data from choice experiments are needed to
   estimate the mean vector and the variances of the multivariate
   heterogeneity distribution involved. In this paper, an efficient
   algorithm is proposed to construct semi-Bayesian D-optimal mixed logit
   designs that take into account the uncertainty about the mean vector of
   the distribution. These designs are compared to locally D-optimal mixed
   logit designs, Bayesian and locally D-optimal designs for the
   multinomial logit model and to nearly orthogonal designs (Sawtooth
   (CBC)) for a wide range of parameter values. It is found that the
   semi-Bayesian mixed logit designs outperform the competing designs not
   only in terms of estimation efficiency but also in terms of prediction
   accuracy. In particular, it is shown that assuming large prior values
   for the variance parameters for constructing semi-Bayesian mixed logit
   designs is most robust against the misspecification of the prior mean
   vector. In addition, the semi-Bayesian mixed logit designs are compared
   to the fully Bayesian mixed logit designs, which take also into account
   the uncertainty about the variances in the heterogeneity distribution
   and which can be constructed only using prohibitively large computing
   power. The differences in estimation and prediction accuracy turn out to
   be rather small in most cases, which indicates that the semi-Bayesian
   approach is currently the most appropriate one if one needs to estimate
   mixed logit models.

AB Two models of competition between high-end and low-end products
   benefiting the high-end firms are presented. One is a quantity
   competition model, and the other is a price competition model with
   product differentiation. The key factor is the existence of two
   heterogeneous consumer groups: those who demand only high-end
   (name-brand) products and those who care little whether products are
   high or low end. We show that, under certain conditions, the profits of
   firms in the high-end market are larger when there are firms producing
   low-end products than when there are not. The existence of
   price-sensitive consumers who care little about product quality
   intensifies competition among the high-end firms. The existence of
   low-end firms functions as a credible threat, which induces the high-end
   firms not to overproduce because price-sensitive consumers buy products
   from the low-end firms. The result provides a new theoretical mechanism
   concerning the profitability and pricing of national brand firms after
   the entry of private labels. It has an implication for pricing and

AB This paper seeks to quantify the long-term financial impact of negative
   word of mouth (NWOM), an issue that has long challenged extant research.
   We do so with real-world data on firm security prices. The developed
   time-series models innovatively uncover (1) short-and long-term effects
   of NWOM on cash flows, stock returns, and stock volatilities, and (2)
   NWOM's "wear-in" effects (i.e., it takes a number of months before the
   stock price impact of NWOM reaches the peak point) and "wear-out"
   effects (i.e., it takes several months after the peak before the stock
   price impact of NWOM dies out completely). In addition, the results
   related to endogeneity and feedback effects from the stock market are
   also interesting, supporting the idea that historical underperformance
   in stock prices may breed more harmful future buzz in a "vicious" cycle
   of NWOM. After controlling for competition, NWOM's long-term financial
   harm becomes more destructive in magnitude, kicks in more quickly, and
   haunts investors longer. Overall, these findings offer some unique
   implications for buzz management, time-series models quantifying the
   financial impact of word of mouth, and the marketing-finance interface.

AB Innovation research tends to consider only the post-commercialization
   period or examine a few innovations through case studies. In this study,
   we examine 29 radical innovations from initial concept to mass-market
   commercialization. We find that these innovations were developed over an
   average of at least 50 years and divide this long development period
   into four distinct stages-conceptualization, gestation, early
   incubation, and late incubation. We find that the duration of a stage is
   longer when different firms lead product development at the beginning
   and end of the stage. These changes in product development leaders
   happen frequently, e. g., 76% of firms that were first to commercialize
   an innovation failed to launch it in the broader market. We also find
   that the time-to-takeoff for a product category is significantly related
   to the duration of the preceding late incubation stage. In addition, we
   find four different ways in which radical innovations borrow from prior
   seemingly unrelated innovations. We report many other findings on when
   (duration times), by whom (product development leaders), and how
   (technology borrowing) radical innovations are developed.

AB In this paper, we extend the standard Hotelling model of product
   differentiation to incorporate a second dimension of consumer
   heterogeneity that relates to the quantity of the product consumers wish
   to buy. This extension allows us to derive optimal nonlinear pricing
   rules chosen by competing sellers when offering differentiated products
   in the marketplace. It also permits us to assess whether sellers find it
   optimal to offer quantity discounts in such a setting, and the
   implications of such discounts on their profitability. We find that
   offering quantity discounts corresponds, indeed, to equilibrium
   behavior. The extent of discounting declines the less differentiated the
   products. Surprisingly, when sellers offer to consumers a choice between
   two different-sized packages, their profits are, at most, as high as
   when such a choice is unavailable. Moreover, when utilizing nonlinear
   pricing rules is not feasible, the profits of the sellers actually
   decline when they offer consumers a choice between different-sized
   packages. A limited empirical investigation supports the comparative
   statics we derive in our theoretical model.

AB Virtual advisors often increase sales for those customers who find such
   online advice to be convenient and helpful. However, other customers
   take a more active role in their purchase decisions and prefer more
   detailed data. In general, we expect that websites are more preferred
   and increase sales if their characteristics (e. g., more detailed data)
   match customers' cognitive styles (e. g., more analytic). "Morphing"
   involves automatically matching the basic "look and feel" of a website,
   not just the content, to cognitive styles. We infer cognitive styles
   from clickstream data with Bayesian updating. We then balance
   exploration (learning how morphing affects purchase probabilities) with
   exploitation (maximizing short-term sales) by solving a dynamic program
   (partially observable Markov decision process). The solution is made
   feasible in real time with expected Gittins indices. We apply the
   Bayesian updating and dynamic programming to an experimental BT Group
   (formerly British Telecom) website using data from 835 priming
   respondents. If we had perfect information on cognitive styles, the
   optimal "morph" assignments would increase purchase intentions by 21%.
   When cognitive styles are partially observable, dynamic programming does
   almost as well-purchase intentions can increase by almost 20%. If
   implemented system-wide, such increases represent approximately $80
   million in additional revenue.

AB Present-biased preferences capture the idea that individuals may find
   immediate payoffs significantly more salient than any future payoffs,
   rather than simply discounting the future in a time-consistent manner.
   In this paper we show that consumers' present-biased preferences can
   generate slippage, and we explore whether this can explain firms' use of
   mail-in rebates. We assume that the consumer population comprises
   members who have various degrees of present bias. The model demonstrates
   that if consumers have homogeneous willingness to pay for a product (and
   thus rebates do not serve as a mechanism for traditional price
   discrimination) rebates may still profitably exploit slippage, but to do
   so they must generate very high slippage rates. This is, because the
   rebate must greatly exceed the price markup because the rebate must
   compensate consumers for the cost of redemption and the delay in
   receiving the rebate. The ability of rebate programs to take advantage
   of present-biased consumers is quite limited in settings where there is
   significant variance in the degree of present bias within the population
   unless the extent of consumers' present bias is highly correlated with
   their rebate redemption costs.

AB Product innovation is the key revenue driver in the motion picture
   industry. Because major studios typically launch fewer than 20 movies
   per year, the financial performance of a single release can have a major
   effect on the studio's profitability. In this paper we study how single
   movie releases impact the investor valuation of the studio. We analyze
   the change in postlaunch stock price and predict the direction and
   magnitude of excess returns based on the revenue expectation built up
   for a movie release. That expectation is set, in part, by media support;
   i.e., highly advertised movies are expected to draw larger audiences
   than others. By using an event-study methodology, we isolate the impact
   of a movie launch on studio stock price and track the determinants of
   that change.
   We examine a comprehensive data set comprising over 300 movies released
   by the largest studios. Our results indicate a clear interaction between
   the marketing support received by a movie and the direction and
   magnitude of its excess stock return post launch. Movies with above
   average prelaunch advertising have lower postlaunch stock returns than
   films with below average advertising. Our findings also suggest that
   movies that are hits at the box office may result in a lowering of stock
   price if they had high media support because of high performance
   expectations built up prior to launch. Thus prelaunch advertising plays
   a dual role of informing consumers about a movie's arrival as well as
   helping investors form expectations about the studio's profit
   performance.

AB We develop a testing methodology that can be used to predict the

   split-hazard model that makes use of a time transformation (a concept we
   call virtual time) to allow for the estimation of straightforward
   parametric hazard functions and generate early predictions of an
   individual campaign's performance (as measured by open and click
   propensities). We apply this pretesting methodology to 25 e-mail
   campaigns and find that the method is able to produce in an hour and
   fifteen minutes estimates that are more accurate and more reliable than
   those that the traditional method (doubling time) produces after 14
   hours. Other benefits of our method are that we make testing independent
   of the time of day and we produce meaningful confidence intervals. Thus,
   our methodology can be used not only for testing purposes, but also for
   live monitoring. The testing procedure is coupled with a formal decision

AB We consider a problem at the interface of auctions and bundling. Our
   revenue-maximizing seller seeking to auction one unit each of two
   complements or substitutes in the best-of-three formats: the auction of
   the bundle, separate auctions of the individual items, and a
   combinatorial auction. We draw on an analytical model to address the
   following questions: (i) Which of the auctioning strategies is optimal
   under the second-price, sealed-bid format? (ii) What is the optimal
   strategy for the bidders? (iii) When the objects are asymmetrically
   valued (e. g., Super Bowl ticket versus souvenir), what is the optimal
   auctioning sequence under the pure components strategy? Our results
   suggest that separate auctions of the two objects are superior to the
   auction of the bundle for most substitutes and even moderate complements
   when there are at least four bidders. The auction of the pure bundle is
   better suited for strong complements or with too few bidders. When the
   combinatorial auction is an available option, it weakly dominates the
   auction of the pure bundle but has domains of inferiority relative to
   the separate auctions. When the objects are asymmetric in value, it is
   optimal to auction the higher-valued object first.

AB In this paper, we propose an individual-level approach to diffusion and
   growth models. By zooming in, we refer to the unit of analysis, which is
   a single consumer (instead of segments or markets) and the use of
   granular sales data (daily) instead of smoothed (e. g., annual) data as
   is more commonly used in the literature. By analyzing the high
   volatility of daily data, we show how changes in sales patterns can
   self-emerge as a direct consequence of the stochastic nature of the
   process. Our contention is that the fluctuations observed in more
   granular data are not noise, but rather consist of accurate measurement
   and contain valuable information. By stepping into the noise-like data
   and treating it as information, we generated better short-term
   predictions even at very early stages of the penetration process. Using
   a Kalman-Filter-based tracker, we demonstrate how movements can be
   traced and how predictions can be significantly improved. We propose
   that for such tasks, daily data with high volatility offer more insights
   than do smoothed annual data.

AB Click fraud is the practice of deceptively clicking on search ads with
   the intention of either increasing third-party website revenues or
   exhausting an advertiser's budget. Search advertisers are forced to
   trust that search engines detect and prevent click fraud even though the
   engines get paid for every undetected fraudulent click. We find
   conditions under which it is in a search engine's interest to allow some
   click fraud.
   Under full information in a second-price auction, if x% of clicks are
   fraudulent, advertisers will lower their bids by x%, leaving the auction
   outcome and search engine revenues unchanged. However, if we allow for
   uncertainty in the amount of click fraud or change the auction type to
   include a click-through component, search engine revenues may rise or
   fall with click fraud. A decrease occurs when the keyword auction is
   relatively competitive because advertisers lower their budgets to hedge
   against downside risk. If the keyword auction is less competitive, click
   fraud may transfer surplus from the winning advertiser to the search
   engine. Our results suggest that the search advertising industry would
   benefit from using a neutral third party to audit search engines' click
   fraud detection algorithms.

AB In certain product categories, large discount retailers are known to
   offer shallower assortments than traditional retailers. In this paper,
   we investigate the competitive incentives for such assortment decisions
   and the implications for manufacturers' distribution strategies. Our
   results show that if one retailer has the channel power to determine its
   assortment first, then it can strategically reduce its assortment by
   carrying only the popular variety while simultaneously inducing the
   rival retailer to carry both the specialty and popular varieties. The
   rival retailer then bears higher assortment costs, which leads to
   relaxed price competition for the commonly carried popular variety. We
   also show that when the manufacturer has relative channel power, it
   chooses alternatively to distribute both product varieties through both
   retailers. Our analysis suggests, therefore, that when a retailer
   becomes dominant in the distribution channel, it facilitates retail
   segmentation into discount shops, carrying limited product lines, and
   specialty shops carrying wider assortments. We also illustrate how
   retailer power leading to strategic assortment reduction can lead to
   lower consumer surplus.

AB Many data sets, from different and seemingly unrelated marketing
   domains, all involve paths-records of consumers' movements in a spatial
   configuration. Path data contain valuable information for marketing
   researchers because they describe how consumers interact with their
   environment and make dynamic choices. As data collection technologies
   improve and researchers continue to ask deeper questions about
   consumers' motivations and behaviors, path data sets will become more
   common and will play a more central role in marketing research.
   To guide future research in this area, we review the previous
   literature, propose a formal definition of a path (in a marketing
   context), and derive a unifying framework that allows us to classify
   different kinds of paths. We identify and discuss two primary dimensions
   (characteristics of the spatial configuration and the agent) as well as
   six underlying subdimensions. Based on this framework, we cover a range
   of important operational issues that should be taken into account as
   researchers begin to build formal models of path-related phenomena. We
   close with a brief look into the future of path-based models, and a call
   for researchers to address some of these emerging issues.

AB Many brands today introduce limited edition ( LE) products as part of
   their product line. However, little is known about the conditions under
   which a brand should introduce an LE product or the competitive
   implications of doing so. We investigate this issue using a game
   theoretic model of a market where two brands compete for consumers who
   desire exclusivity. Our analysis shows that adding an LE product has a
   positive direct effect on brand profits through the increased
   willingness of consumers to pay for such a product, but also has a
   negative strategic effect by increasing price competition between
   brands. These effects result in different conclusions depending on the
   nature of brand differentiation. When brands differ in quality, we show
   that only the high-quality brand may gain in comparison to a scenario
   where there are no LE products. Although a low-quality brand may offer
   an LE product as a defensive strategy, its profits are lower than would
   be in a world without LE products because of the negative strategic
   effect. When we consider brands that are differentiated on a horizontal
   attribute such as taste, we find that the negative strategic effects
   cause lower equilibrium profits if both brands introduce LE products.
   Yet brands cannot avoid introducing LE products because they face a
   prisoners' dilemma.

AB This paper combines different aggregate-level data sets to identify new
   product demand in consumer packaged goods (CPG) categories. Our approach
   augments market-level time-series data with widely available summaries
   of household purchase behavior, i.e., brand penetration and purchase set
   size data. We show that this augmentation is helpful in the estimation
   of consumer heterogeneity. For instance, observing a brand with
   relatively large shares and low penetration typically indicates that
   preferences are dispersed, with relatively few customers liking the
   brand a lot. Whereas the combination of share and penetration is
   informative about heterogeneity with realistic sample sizes, in
   isolation neither variable may lead to precise estimates of
   heterogeneity. In addition, other widely available data, e. g., category
   penetration, is helpful in estimating the size of the total market.
   Using a large Monte Carlo study, the paper demonstrates the benefits of
   the proposed approach in estimating model parameters, price
   elasticities, and brand switching. Empirically, the approach is used to
   evaluate the launch of a new national brand, DiGiorno, in the frozen
   pizza category. The new brand is inferred to be very successful at
   expanding the category, while avoiding cannibalization of existing
   company share. Using only standard information, i.e., market shares, to
   estimate the demand model leads, in our data, to poor estimates of the
   degree of consumer taste variation and of switching to a new brand.

AB We model a duopoly in which ex ante identical firms must decide where to
   direct their innovation efforts. The firms face market uncertainty about
   consumers' preferences for innovation on two product attributes and
   technology uncertainty about the success of their research and
   development (R&D) investments. Firms can conduct costly market research
   before setting R&D strategy. We find that the value of market
   information to a firm depends on whether its rival is expected to obtain
   this information in equilibrium. Consequently, one firm may forgo market
   research even though its rival conducts such research and learns the
   true state of demand. We examine both vertical and horizontal demand
   structures. With vertical preferences, firms are a priori uncertain
   about which attribute all consumers will value more. In this case, a
   firm that conducts market research always attempts innovation on the
   attribute it discovers that consumers prefer and expends more on R&D
   than a rival that has not conducted market research. With horizontal
   preferences, distinct segments exist-each caring about innovation on
   only one attribute-and firms are a priori uncertain how many consumers
   each segment contains. In this case, a firm that conducts market
   research may follow a niche strategy and attempt innovation to serve the
   smaller segment to avoid intense price competition for the larger
   segment. A firm that conducts market research may therefore invest less
   in R&D and earn lower postlaunch profits than a rival that has forgone
   such research.

AB When a firm allows the return of previously purchased merchandise, it
   provides customers with an option that has measurable value. Whereas the
   option to return merchandise leads to an increase in gross revenue, it
   also creates additional costs. Selecting an optimal return policy
   requires balancing both demand and cost implications. In this paper, we
   develop a structural model of a consumer's decision to purchase and
   return an item that nests extant choice models as a special case. The
   model enables a firm to both measure the value to consumers of the
   return option and balance the costs and benefits of different return
   policies.
   We apply the model to a sample of data provided by a mail-order catalog
   company. We find considerable variation in the value of returns across
   customers and categories. When the option value is large, there are
   large increases in demand. For example, the option to return women's
   footwear is worth an average of more than $15 per purchase to customers
   and increases average purchase rates by more than 50%. We illustrate how
   the model can be used by a retailer to optimize his return policies
   across categories and customers.

AB New product launches are often accompanied by extensive marketing
   communication campaigns. Firms' allocation decisions for these marketing
   communication expenditures have two dimensions-across consumers and over
   time. This allocation problem is different relative to the problem of
   allocation of resources for existing products. In the case of new
   products, consumers are uncertain about their quality and learn about
   the products through marketing communication. Furthermore, different
   consumers may have different rates of learning about product quality;
   i.e., there may be heterogeneous learning. Thus, consumer responsiveness
   to marketing communication could vary along two dimensions. For each
   consumer, this responsiveness would vary over time, as she learns about
   product quality. Across consumers, there would be differences in
   responsiveness in each time period. For optimal allocation of marketing
   communication across both consumers and time, firms would need estimates
   of how consumer responsiveness varies across consumers and over time.
   Past studies have typically focused on one of these two dimensions in
   which responsiveness varies. They have either looked at heterogeneity in
   responsiveness across agents or the variation in responsiveness over
   time. In the context of new products, past research has looked at how
   consumer learning about product quality causes responsiveness to vary
   over time. In this study, we build a model that allows for heterogeneous
   learning rates and obtain individual-level learning parameters for each
   consumer. We use a novel and rich panel data set that allows us to
   estimate these model parameters.
   To obtain individual-level estimates of learning, we add a hierarchical
   Bayesian structure to the Bayesian learning model. We exploit the
   natural hierarchy in the Bayesian learning process to incorporate it in
   the hierarchical Bayesian model. We use data augmentation, coupled with
   the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to make inferences about
   individual-level parameters of learning. We conduct this analysis on a
   unique panel data set of physicians where we observe prescription
   decisions and detailing (i.e., sales-force effort) at the individual
   physician level for a new prescription drug category.
   Our results show that there is significant heterogeneity across
   physicians in their rates of learning about the quality of new drugs. We
   also find that there are asymmetries in the temporal evolution of
   responsiveness of physicians to detailing-physicians who are more
   responsive to detailing in early periods are less responsive later on
   and vice versa. These findings have interesting implications for the
   targeting of detailing across physicians and over time. We find that
   firms could increase their revenue if they took these temporal and
   cross-sectional differences in responsiveness into account while
   deciding on allocations of detailing.

AB Critics often decry an earnings-focused short-term orientation of
   management that eschews spending on risky, long-term projects such as
   innovation to boost a firm's stock price. Such critics assume that stock
   markets react positively to announcements of immediate earnings but
   negatively to announcements of investments in innovation that have an
   uncertain long-term pay off. Contrary to this position, we argue that
   the market's true appreciation of innovation can be estimated by
   assessing the total market returns to the entire innovation project. We
   demonstrate this approach via the Fama-French 3-factor model (including
   Carhart's momentum factor) on 5,481 announcements from 69 firms in five
   markets and 19 technologies between 1977 and 2006.
   The total market returns to an innovation project are $643 million, more
   than 13 times the $49 million from an average innovation event. Returns
   to negative events are higher in absolute value than those to positive
   events. Returns to initiation occur 4.7 years ahead of launch. Returns
   to development activities are the highest and those to commercialization
   the lowest of all activities. Returns to new product launch are the
   lowest among all eight events tracked. Returns are higher for smaller
   firms than larger firms. Returns to the announcing firm are
   substantially greater than those to competitors across all stages. We
   discuss the implications of these results.

AB This study investigates the effects of turning terabytes of raw retail
   data into managerial insights (i.e., downstream information acquisition)
   in a strategic channel setting. Two effects of information acquisition
   are identified-the efficiency effect that improves retail pricing
   decision making in an uncertain environment, and the strategic effect
   whereby the retailer voluntarily discloses the acquired private
   information to influence the upstream manufacturer's wholesale pricing
   behavior. It is shown that the efficiency effect benefits the retailer
   without affecting the manufacturer, while the strategic effect works to
   the detriment of the retailer but to the advantage of the manufacturer.
   Nevertheless, unobservable information acquisition can mitigate the
   retailer's loss and the manufacturer's benefit from the strategic effect
   of information disclosure. Moreover, an increasing expected information
   acquisition cost may benefit the retailer, when that cost is low and
   information acquisition is unobservable to the manufacturer. The
   implications of this paper can shed light on how firms interact in a
   channel where the downstream market is data intensive, but information
   gleaning is costly.

AB Consumers cannot purchase a prescription drug without a prescription

   with the help of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising. In this paper, we
   propose and test a competitive model of DTC advertising. We find that
   the brand specificity of DTC advertising can have an inverted U-shaped
   relationship with detailing, DTC advertising, and profits. Furthermore,
   an increase in the cross-price sensitivity between competing
   prescription drugs is not always detrimental to firm profits. A

   predictions. We also discuss potential implications of DTC advertising

AB Marketers disclose quality information directly to potential consumers
   using a variety of communication channels. This study investigates how
   competition may influence duopoly firms' incentive to voluntarily reveal
   quality information. We show that firms in competitive markets reveal
   less information than a monopoly firm. In addition, sequential
   disclosure leads to asymmetric equilibrium disclosure behavior: the
   disclosure leader reveals unambiguously less information than in the
   simultaneous disclosure case, whereas the follower ex ante reveals less
   (more) private information than that released by the leader or by the
   firms in the simultaneous case when the disclosure cost is sufficiently
   low (high). We also examine the equilibrium firm profits and social
   welfare. We demonstrate that there may be a U-shaped relationship
   between equilibrium monopoly profits (or social welfare under both
   monopoly and duopoly) and the disclosure cost. Moreover, in comparison
   to the simultaneous disclosure case, sequential disclosure can lead to
   increasingly softened competition, improving both firm profitability and
   social welfare.

AB Standardizing performance expectations across different outlets within a

   nature of competition they face, can be an onerous task. We develop an
   integrated, nonlinear, block group-level market share model of store
   expectations that draws upon the existing trade area as well as store
   performance literatures. By incorporating and normalizing a large number
   of external and internal factors impacting performance, we are able to
   offer a means for the retailer to determine equitable standards. The
   model is estimated using a variation of the maximum-likelihood
   estimation, on a data set fashioned from several sources and aggregated
   at the block group and store levels. Finally, we propose a set of
   indices that allows us to evaluate relative performances of stores and
   regions given the competitive environments they face. We find that a
   block group-level model offers a better fit, as well as significantly
   richer implications, than a traditional store-level model. Results show
   that a significant number of stores operate well below their expected
   levels, an insight not obvious from the raw numbers used to report store

AB We investigate price competition between firms in markets characterized
   by consumer variety seeking. While previous research has addressed the
   effect of consumer inertia on prices, there exists no research on the
   effects of variety seeking on price competition. Our study fills this
   gap in the literature. Using a two-period duopoly framework as in
   Klemperer's analysis of inertial markets, we show that the
   noncooperative pricing equilibrium in a market with consumer variety
   seeking may be the same as the collusive outcome in an otherwise
   identical market without variety seeking. Specifically, our
   variety-seeking model implies tacit collusion between firms in both
   periods, unlike the inertia model of Klemperer that implies tacit
   collusion between firms only in the second period but implies fierce
   price competition in the first period. When consumers are assumed to
   have rational expectations about future prices, the implied first-period
   prices increase further, which is consistent with what Klemperer finds
   in an inertial market. To summarize, while our variety-seeking analyses
   support two key results (pertaining to second-period prices and rational
   expectations) previously derived for inertial markets by Klemperer, they
   depart from one key result (pertaining to first-period prices).

   finances production costs not only by the conventional funding from an
   institutional investor, but also by "Internet funding," financing
   through the Internet from so-called netizen investors. In Internet
   funding, netizen investors engage in word-of-mouth activities. Assuming
   that information asymmetry exists between the producer and investors, we
   investigate how the Internet funding size varies with the word-of-mouth
   effect, the monitoring effect of the institutional investor, and the
   bargaining power of the producer over investors. When the producer has
   no bargaining power, the Internet funding size is determined by
   balancing the word-of-mouth effect with the monitoring effect by the
   institutional investment. If there is no word-of-mouth effect, there may
   be no Internet funding, because netizen investors interpret Internet
   funding as an indicator of a negative profit. When the producer has high
   bargaining power, full Internet funding is possible if the information
   asymmetry of the film quality is resolved. We discuss how information
   asymmetry can be resolved by the monitoring of the film quality, the
   producer's reputation, or the insurance on investment returns. Our model
   helps to capture several interesting aspects of Internet funding in the
   Korean film industry.

AB This research extends a Pareto/NBD model of customer-base analysis using
   a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) framework to suit today's customized
   marketing. The proposed HB model presumes three tried and tested
   assumptions of Pareto/NBD models: (1) a Poisson purchase process, (2) a
   memoryless dropout process (i.e., constant hazard rate), and (3)
   heterogeneity across customers, while relaxing the independence
   assumption of the purchase and dropout rates and incorporating customer
   characteristics as covariates. The model also provides useful output for
   CRM, such as a customer-specific lifetime and survival rate, as
   by-products of the MCMC estimation.
   Using three different types of databases-music CD for e-commerce, FSP
   data for a department store and a music CD chain, the HB model is
   compared against the benchmark Pareto/NBD model. The study demonstrates
   that recency-frequency data, in conjunction with customer behavior and
   characteristics, can provide important insights into direct marketing
   issues, such as the demographic profile of best customers and whether

AB We analyze firms' decisions to invest in customer relationship
   management (CRM) initiatives such as acquisition and retention in a
   competitive context, a topic largely ignored in past CRM research. We
   characterize each customer by her intrinsic preference towards each
   firm, the contribution margin she generates for each firm, and her
   responsiveness to each firm's retention and acquisition efforts. We show
   that a firm should invest most heavily in retaining those customers that
   exhibit moderate responsiveness to its CRM efforts. Further, a firm
   should most aggressively seek to attract those customers that exhibit
   moderate responsiveness to their provider's CRM efforts and those that
   are moderately profitable for their current provider. Investing more in
   customers that are more responsive does not always lead to higher firm
   profits, because stronger competition for such customers tends to erode
   the effects of higher CRM efforts of an individual firm. When firms
   develop a customer relationship over time to generate higher
   contribution margin or customer responsiveness, we show that such
   developments may not always be desirable, because sometimes these future
   bene fits may lead to more intense competition and hence lower profits
   for both firms.

   (TSP) as a normative frame of reference. We define the TSP-path for each
   shopper as the shortest path that connects all of his purchases. We then
   decompose the length of each observed path into three components: the
   length of the TSP-path, the additional distance because of order
   deviation (i.e., not following the TSP-order of category purchases), and
   the additional distance because of travel deviation (i.e., not following
   the shortest point-to-point route). We explore the relationship between
   these deviations and different aspects of in-store shopping/purchase
   behavior. Among other things, our results suggest that (1) a large
   proportion of trip length is because of travel deviation; (2) paths that
   deviate substantially from the TSP solution are associated with larger
   shopping baskets; (3) order deviation is strongly associated with
   purchase behavior, while travel deviation is not; and (4) shoppers with
   paths closer to the TSP solution tend to buy more from frequently
   purchased product categories.

   influenced by the judgements of wine critics; a 10% rise in newspapers'
   scores in Norway was accompanied by an average increase of 16%-18% in
   sales figures for table wines. The effect of wine reviews varied
   somewhat from newspaper to newspaper. It proved difficult to establish
   criteria for a good wine buy that are objective and independent of the
   person making the judgement. The journalists gave no unanimous

AB Price-matching guarantees (PMGs) are offers to match a competitor's
   price on a specific item. Such guarantees are extremely common in U. S.
   retail practice, and their impact has been studied in several published
   papers. The existing analytic literature models each retailer as a
   single-product seller; most work assumes that each retailer's product is
   identical with (or completely substitutable for) the competitor's
   product. In reality, competing retailers often sell multiple products,
   and these products do not always overlap, or may overlap partially but
   not totally. Furthermore, retailers that offer PMGs routinely exclude
   certain offerings from PMG coverage. This raises the interesting
   question of how product variety and product-stocking factors affect
   retailer decisions about offering PMGs.
   In this paper, we simultaneously consider three factors of retailing
   importance that imply results consistent with PMG use and nonuse: the
   ability to choose to stock the same product as, or a product
   differentiated from, a competitor's offering; the possibility of
   shelf-space limitations on the ability to stock complete variety; and
   the category-demand-enhancing effect of variety. These are sensible and
   realistic descriptive factors shaping retailers' product and pricing
   decisions, and because they have not been considered jointly in the
   prior literature on PMGs, their joint consideration helps to expand our
   understanding of the drivers of PMG implementation and impact. In the
   presence of these three factors, we examine retailers' decisions about
   whether to offer a PMG, what product(s) to stock, and how to price the
   product(s) stocked.
   Our results show that shelf-space limitations have an important
   influence on PMG provision: in particular, when retailers are
   shelf-space constrained, and product substitutability in the category is
   sufficiently large, choosing to use PMGs (which by definition also
   requires stocking identical products) is strictly less profitable than
   enduring Bertrand (price) competition but enjoying retail product
   differentiation. The result that PMGs can be profit-reducing relative to
   head-to-head retail competition is a novel one, driven in our model by
   the opportunity costs of stocking identical products, i.e., the
   inability to benefit from the demand-enhancing effects of variety and
   the differential (small or large) between Bertrand pricing and PMG
   pricing levels. We further show that under asymmetric shelf-space
   availability, either product variety will be severely limited or
   retailers will offer a different array of products. Weak substitution
   between products leads to the latter, with pricing between the
   differentiated products Bertrand and monopoly levels; strong
   substitution leads to the former, with pricing at the monopoly level.
   Our results also show that with unlimited shelf space, both competing
   retailers offer PMGs, stock the entire available product line, and enjoy
   monopoly pricing. Given our focus on product variety issues, we also
   relate our results to the literature on branded variants.
   Our results demonstrate that the nature of product variety, the
   availability of retail shelf space, and the category-demand-enhancing
   effect of variety are key market characteristics that jointly and
   strongly affect the optimality of PMGs and the resulting pricing and
   profitability characteristics of the market.

AB When researchers from different fields with different norms collaborate,
   the question arises of how name-ordering conventions are chosen and how
   they affect contribution credits. In this paper, we answer these
   questions by studying two disciplines that exemplify the two
   cornerstones of name-ordering conventions: lexicographical ordering
   (i.e., alphabetical ordering, endorsed in economics) and
   nonlexicographical ordering (i.e., ordering according to individual
   contributions, endorsed in psychology). Inferences about credits are
   unambiguous in the latter arrangement but imperfect in the former,
   because alphabetical listing can reflect ordering according to
   individual contributions by chance.
   We contrast the fields of economics and psychology with marketing, a
   discipline heavily influenced by both. Based on archival data,
   consisting of more than 38,000 journal articles, we show that the three
   fields have different ordering practices. In two empirical studies with
   351 faculty and graduate student participants from all three
   disciplines, as well as in a computer simulation, we show that ordering
   practices systematically affect and shape the allocation of perceived
   contributions and credit. Whereas strong disciplinary norms in economics
   and psychology govern the allocation of contribution credits, a more
   heterogeneous picture emerges for marketing. This lack of strong norms
   has detrimental effects in terms of assigned contribution credits.

AB Many services are delivered to a (large) number of customers
   simultaneously within a confined zone (e. g., restaurants, resorts,
   trains, and airplanes). Under unexpected high demand, customers
   experience discomfort from two major sources: (a) the sardine effect
   that arises when too many customers (i.e., sardines) compete for space
   and service resources, and (b) the captivity effect that results from an
   exit cost incurred by customers who self-select to "escape" the
   unpleasant service. This paper investigates the optimal compensation and
   pricing policies under these two effects. We find that offering
   compensation to sardines can improve profit and social welfare. However,
   consumers do not benefit when compensated for the discomfort from
   crowding. This paper also provides insights by exploring the impact of
   changes in the two effects on price and profit.

AB We examine the problem of how a content provider, specifically the
   National Academies Press (NAP), can optimally price the different forms
   of its product-print and PDF-that it sells online. Whereas products in
   the traditional product line generally tend to be substitutes, the
   different content product forms could range from being substitutes to
   being complements across customers. Thus the content provider can
   possibly sell bundles of the product forms, leading to additional
   revenue. We first discuss NAP's decision context and describe the model
   we proposed for developing NAP's optimal pricing policies for its
   different forms. We describe the choice experiment we conducted on the
   publisher's website that maximally uses the online interface to collect
   relevant data needed to estimate our model. We show how NAP embraced the
   results from the model for developing a new business model and how it
   used the insights derived from the study to set pricing policies and
   monitor sales performance as a function of pricing. Finally, we perform
   validation of the model and the implemented policies using dynamic
   modeling of sales data from NAP's website. The paper illustrates how
   e-commerce technologies can lead to the development of optimal policies
   using marketing models.

AB In addition to retailing new vehicles, automotive manufacturers in the
   United States sell millions of vehicles through leasing and to fleet
   customers every year. The majority of these vehicles are returned to the
   automotive manufacturers at the end of the contracted term and must be
   "remarketed." In 2007, about 10 million used vehicles were sold at more
   than 400 auctions in the United States. Large consigners face decisions
   every day about when, where, and at what price to offer these vehicles,
   which has significant financial implications for their profitability.
   To address the challenges of the distribution process, Power Information
   Network (PIN), a division of J.D. Power and Associates, developed the
   PIN Optimal Distribution of Auction Vehicles System (ODAV), an automated
   decision optimization system that helps remarketers maximize profits
   through the most advantageous distribution of their auction vehicles. At
   the core of the system is a combination of three models that determine
   the distribution of the vehicles on a daily basis: a nearest neighbor
   linear regression model for short-term auction price forecasting; an
   autoregressive integrated moving average time-series analysis model for
   volume-price elasticity; and a genetic algorithm optimizer for vehicle
   distribution.
   Since its launch in 2003, PIN has been providing ODAV services on a
   daily basis, and to date, more than two million vehicles have been
   distributed through this system. In this paper, we will describe the PIN
   ODAV System, its implementation, and the business impact by using as an
   example the experience with our largest client, Chrysler Group LLC.

AB Procter & Gamble (P&G) Asia-Pacific is interested in managing value
   growth. Only after fully understanding the true effects of the
   marketing-mix variables can P&G managers make strategic decisions
   answering questions such as the following: (1) Are the P&G brands in the
   detergent market inelastic or elastic with respect to price? How has the
   price elasticity changed over time? Can P&G increase the price of its
   brands to gain value growth? (2) What are the price, distribution, and
   sizing combinations needed to achieve the desirable value growth? (3)
   How can P&G gain market share from its competitors without cannibalizing
   its own brands? P&G Asia-Pacific approached us to develop a value growth
   framework to answer these questions. To generate the answers for the
   above questions, we develop a three-step weighted random coefficient
   estimator that captures the heterogeneity across cross sections
   (different stock-keeping units and states) and the endogeneity of
   distribution. Based on the parameter estimates, we provide strategic
   recommendations to P&G for a field test to validate our suggestions. We
   developed a simulator for P&G managers so that they can generate
   appropriate marketing-mix strategies for achieving the desired value
   growth. As a result, P&G gained over $39 million in value growth over a
   one-year period by implementing the recommendations from our modeling
   approach.

AB We study how market structure within a product category varies across
   retail formats. Building on the literature on internal market structure,
   we estimate a joint store and brand choice model where the loading
   matrix of brand attributes are allowed to be retail format specific. The
   approach allows us to recover brand maps for different retail formats
   while controlling for the short-term marketing mix activities at these
   stores and the self-selection of households that frequent a particular
   format. The model is applied to consumer panel data from two product
   categories, where households are observed to make purchases across three
   store types: high-end grocery store, traditional supermarket, and large
   everyday low pricing (EDLP) formats. Our results show strong
   correlations between the marketing mix sensitivities, store format
   preference, and unobserved brand attributes. These correlations
   translate into significant differences in market structure across retail
   formats and in the direction and size of preference vectors for
   unobservable brand attributes. We find a tight clustering of brands at
   the EDLP format, whereas brands are found to compete in distinct
   subgroups at other stores. Results show that failure to account for
   retail format effects can substantially bias the understanding of
   underlying market structure and could lead to incorrect implications in
   applications such as new product entry.

AB In the last few decades, the measurement of marketing constructs has
   improved tremendously. Our discipline has also started to systematically
   catalogue our measurement knowledge in influential handbooks of
   marketing scales. However, at least two important issues remain. First,
   existing scales are often too long for administration in nonstudent
   samples or in applied studies. Second, existing (U. S.-developed) scales
   may contain items that are not informative about the underlying
   construct in particular countries, whereas relevant items tapping into
   local cultural expressions of the construct in question may be missing.
   To address these issues, we propose a new model that yields
   country-specific yet fully cross-nationally comparable short forms of
   unidimensional marketing scales. The procedure is based on hierarchical
   item response theory and optimal test design. The procedure is flexible
   in the sense that the researcher can specify various constraints on item
   content, scale length, and measurement precision. Because our procedure
   allows inclusion of country-specific (or "emic") items in standardized
   (or "etic") scales, it presents an important step toward resolving the
   emic-etic dilemma that has plagued international marketing research for
   decades.

AB Prior marketing literature has overlooked the role of regulatory regimes
   in explaining international sales growth of new products. This paper
   addresses this gap in the context of new pharmaceuticals (15 new
   molecules in 34 countries) and sheds light on the effects of regulatory
   regimes on new drug sales across the globe. Based on a time-varying
   coefficient model, we find that differences in regulation substantially
   contribute to cross-country variation in sales. One of the regulatory
   constraints investigated, i.e., manufacturer price controls, has a
   positive effect on drug sales. The other forms of regulation such as
   restrictions of physician prescription budgets and the prohibition of
   direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) tend to hurt sales. The effect of
   manufacturer price controls is similar for newly launched and mature
   drugs. By contrast, regulations on physician prescription budgets and
   DTCA have a differential effect for newly launched and mature drugs.
   Whereas the former hurts mature drugs more, the latter has a larger
   effect on newly launched drugs. In addition to these regulatory effects,
   we find that national culture, economic wealth, and lagged sales also
   affect drug sales. Our findings may be used as input by managers for
   international launch and marketing decisions. They may also be used by
   public policy administrators to assess the role of regulatory regimes in
   pharmaceutical sales growth.

AB We propose a dynamic programming framework for retailers of frequently
   purchased consumer goods in which the prices affect both the profit per
   visit in the current period and the number of visitors (i.e., store
   traffic) in future periods. We show that optimal category prices in the
   infinite-horizon problem also maximize the closed form sum of a
   geometric series, allowing us to derive meaningful analytical results.
   Modeling the linkage between category prices and future store traffic
   fundamentally changes optimal pricing policy. Optimal pricing must
   balance current profits against future traffic; under general
   conditions, optimal long-run prices are uniformly lower across all
   categories than those that maximize current profits. This result
   explains the empirical generalization that category demand in grocery
   stores is inelastic. Parameterizing profit per visit and store traffic
   reveals that, as future traffic becomes more sensitive to price,
   retailers should increasingly lower current prices and sacrifice current
   profits. We also determine how the burden of drawing future traffic to
   the store should be distributed across categories; this is the
   foundation for a new taxonomy of category roles.

AB In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of a firm's proactive
   management of customer-to-customer communication. We are particularly
   interested in understanding how, if at all, the firm should go about
   effecting meaningful word-of-mouth (WOM) communications. To tackle this
   problem, we collect data from two sources: (1) we implement a
   large-scale field test in which a national firm created word of mouth
   through two populations: customers and noncustomers, and (2) we collect
   data from an online experiment. We break our theoretical problem into
   two subproblems. First, we ask: "What kind of WOM drives sales?"
   Motivated by previous research, we hypothesize that for a product with a
   low initial awareness level, WOM that is most effective at driving sales
   is created by less loyal (not highly loyal) customers and occurs between
   acquaintances (not friends). We find support for this in the field test
   as well as in an experimental setting. Hence, we demonstrate the
   potential usefulness of exogenously created WOM: conversations are
   created where none would naturally have occured otherwise. Then, we ask:
   "Which agents are most effective at creating this kind of WOM?" In
   particular, we are interested in evaluating the effectiveness of the
   commonly used opinion leader designation. We find that although opinion
   leadership is useful in identifying potentially effective spreaders of
   WOM among very loyal customers, it is less useful for the sample of less
   loyal customers.

   (2) whether differential and dynamic effects of permanent price cuts
   occur for different types of consumers, and (3) the implications of
   publicly announced permanent price cuts on consumer brand switching

   behaviors before and after this permanent price cut. Using unique
   consumer panel data pertaining to cigarette purchases before and after

   drastic and permanent price cut represented an effective step to
   encourage brand switching for an addictive product and a necessary step
   for Philip Morris to combat the growing market share of generic brands.

AB This research has three objectives: (i) to compile analytical results on

   models, (ii) to assess the external validity of those results and thus
   the applicability of the results to practice, and (iii) to identify
   avenues for further research on national brand and store brand
   competition.
   A total of 44 analytical results (29 related to retailer strategies and
   15 related to manufacturer strategies) are compiled from a survey of
   literature published between 1966 and 2006. Three criteria are then used
   to assess the external validity of these results-robustness (R),
   empirical support (E), and credibility (C) (collectively, REC). Each
   result is quantitatively assessed (scored) using these three criteria.
   Robustness is measured as the total number of relevant market conditions
   for which the result has been shown to hold. Empirical support is
   measured as the number of independent empirical studies in which the
   findings are consistent with the analytical result. Credibility is
   measured as the believability of the theoretical result as perceived by
   experienced brand managers and retail executives.
   Thus, the REC scoring approach represents a triangulation of
   perspectives-robustness (modeler perspective), empirical support
   (empiricist perspective), and credibility (managerial perspective). In
   particular, this research serves in part as a bridge between scholars
   and practitioners in the context of national brand and store brand
   marketing.

AB We use data on all manufacturer funding and promotion activity by a
   major U.S. retailer during a two-year period to compute promotion
   pass-through and assess its magnitude. Then, we estimate a two-tiered
   probit and lognormal regression model to study drivers of the large
   variation we observe in pass-through rates.
   Although our analysis is based on data from a single retailer, it
   provides a much more complete picture of the magnitude and variability
   of pass-through than has been available to date. Some key insights from
   our work are as follows. First, the retailer passes through more than
   100% of the total manufacturer funding it receives in aggregate, but the
   median pass-through rate for individual manufacturers is much lower than
   100%. Second, some manufacturers are promoted even without funding. This
   is more likely for private label and high-share manufacturers in
   high-lift and high-margin categories. Third, a small number of
   manufacturer and category characteristics explain a significant amount
   of the variation in pass-through. In particular, pass-through is higher
   for private label. It increases with the share of the manufacturer in
   the focal category but also with the sales of that manufacturer in other
   categories. Categories with high sales, high promotion lift, low
   concentration, and low margin get more pass-through.
   We corroborate some recent conclusions in the literature, e. g., that
   some pass-through rates are much higher than 100% and that high-share
   manufacturers get more pass-through. We add several new insights, e. g.,
   on the magnitude of aggregate pass-through, on cross-pass-through across
   and within categories, on pass-through for private label, and on the
   category drivers of pass-through.

AB We consider a marketer of components who can select one of three
   alternative pricing strategies: (1) a pure component strategy (i.e., the
   customer can only buy the components individually), (2) a pure bundling
   strategy (i.e., the components must be purchased together), or (3) a
   mixed bundling strategy (i.e., the customer may buy a component
   individually, or buy the bundle). We consider a market where customer
   knowledge of components varies and propose that a high-knowledge
   customer can determine with greater certainty whether a given component
   is useful to her. Consequently, more knowledgeable customers have higher
   variability in their reservation price of a component. Using an
   analytical model, we identify the conditions under which each of the
   three pricing strategies maximizes profit and show that three factors
   determine the optimal strategy: marginal costs of components,
   distribution of knowledge over the customer population, and relative
   sizes of customer segments where each segment is interested in the same
   subset of components. Managerial implications and directions for future
   research are discussed.

AB We investigate the association between information contained in the
   American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) metric and future stock
   market performance. Some past research has provided results suggesting
   that the financial markets misprice customer satisfaction; i.e., firms
   advantaged in customer satisfaction are posited to earn positive
   future-period abnormal stock returns. We reexamine this relationship and
   find that statistically significant evidence of financial market
   mispricing of customer satisfaction is limited to firms in the computer
   and Internet sector. The results suggest that the mispricing anomaly
   reported in past research appears not to stem from a systemic failure of
   the financial markets to impound the financial implications of customer
   satisfaction into current stock price, but rather from abnormal returns
   achieved by a small group of satisfaction leaders in the computer and
   Internet sector over the period of study. Analyses based on
   unconditional risk covariates and analyses using conditional risk
   covariates estimated from short-window, high-frequency data support this
   finding.

AB According to Jacobson and Mizik [Jacobson, R., N. Mizik. 2009. The
   financial markets and customer satisfaction: Reexamining possible
   financial market mispricing of customer satisfaction. Marketing Sci.
   28(5) 810-819], excess stock portfolio returns for firms with strong
   customer satisfaction are small and statistically insignificant, and if
   there is any above-market performance at all, it is due to a small set
   of firms in the computer and Internet industries. But their data seem to
   suggest the opposite. The returns are actually both exceptionally large
   and significant. Using monthly data, their portfolio consisting of
   strong American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) firms outperformed
   the market by 0.0053, corresponding to 6.4% cumulative risk-adjusted
   above-market returns on an annual basis over a 10-year period-a
   performance that would beat at least 99% of all large-cap U. S. stock
   funds tracked by Morningstar. Using a different treatment of risk, their
   annualized risk-adjusted return is a whopping 8.4% better than market.
   After eliminating computer, Internet, and utility companies, they find
   that the monthly risk-adjusted abnormal returns drop to 0.0045, which
   corresponds to an annual above-market return of 5.4%. This too is better
   than 99% of all actively managed stock funds in the population. Yet
   Jacobson and Mizik conclude that these returns are not statistically
   significant and that there is no evidence that stock returns from firms
   with strong customer satisfaction outperform the market over the long
   run.
   The failure to reject the null hypothesis is probably due to a lack of
   statistical power in Jacobson and Mizik's analysis. We discuss why this
   is likely the case and then present new data updating the results from
   our original article [Fornell, C., S. Mithas, F. Morgeson III, M. S.
   Krishnan. 2006. Customer satisfaction and stock prices: High returns,
   low risk. J. Marketing 70(1) 3-14]. The above-market returns persist and

AB A number of recent marketing studies examine the stock market's response
   to the release of American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) scores.
   The broad purpose of these studies is to investigate the stock market's
   valuation of customer satisfaction. However, a key focus is on whether
   customer satisfaction information predicts long-run returns. We provide
   evidence on the market's pricing of ACSI information using a more
   comprehensive set of well-established tests from the accounting and
   finance literatures. We find that ACSI scores provide some incremental
   information on future operating income and that the market quickly
   responds to the release of information on large increases in
   satisfaction. However, we find no evidence that ACSI predicts long-run
   returns. These results suggest that customer satisfaction information is
   value relevant, but they are also consistent with Jacobson and Mizik's
   conclusion [Jacobson, R., N. Mizik. 2009. The financial markets and
   customer satisfaction: Reexamining possible financial market mispricing
   of customer satisfaction. Marketing Sci. 28(5) 810-819] that mispricing

AB As high-tech markets mature, replacement purchases inevitably become the
   dominant proportion of sales. Despite the clear importance of product
   replacement, little empirical work examines the separate roles of
   adoption and replacement. A consumer's replacement decision is dynamic
   and driven by product obsolescence because these markets frequently
   undergo rapid improvements in quality and falling prices. The goal of
   this paper is to construct a model of consumer product replacement and
   to investigate the implications of replacement cycles for firms.
   To this end, I develop and estimate a dynamic model of consumer demand
   that explicitly accounts for the replacement decision when consumers are
   uncertain about future price and quality. Using a unique data set from
   the PC processor industry, I show how to combine aggregate data on sales
   and product ownership to infer replacement behavior. The results reveal
   substantial variation in replacement behavior over time, and this
   heterogeneity provides an opportunity for managers to tailor their
   product introduction and pricing strategies to target the consumers of a
   particular segment that are most likely to replace in the near future.

AB In a market of consumers with varying willingness to pay, using product
   line as a discrimination tool may extract higher profits than serving
   all consumers with a single product. Local context effects, however,
   point to yet another consideration in designing product lines: how the
   appeal of a product changes with the context provided by other products
   in the choice set.
   I present a model of product line design that incorporates both
   discrimination and context management goals and offers recommendations
   for the variety and positioning of products. To this end, the model
   makes use of a framework that allows preferences to be choice set
   dependent. Given this framework, I study how the firm manages
   externalities between products created by such dependencies. The firm
   creates distortions above and beyond those resulting from discrimination
   motives alone. For example, in a vertically differentiated market for
   quality, quality distortions exist even for the consumers with the
   highest valuations. The range of quality provisions, given the number of
   products, is compressed as the relative importance of unfavorable
   comparisons among products increases. Surprisingly, this compression may
   even lead the firm to forego discrimination among consumers regardless
   of the cost of offering distinct products.

AB In this paper, we study the standardization and customization decisions
   of two firms in a competitive setting, along with variety, lead time,
   and price decisions. We incorporate consumer heterogeneity both in firm
   preference (or store convenience) and in product attribute preferences.
   We find that the equilibrium outcome depends on the cost efficiencies of
   the production technologies as well as the consumer sensitivity to
   product fit and lead time. We develop an index that signifies the
   relative attractiveness of the standardization and customization
   strategies, and the potential outcomes. We identify the strategic roles
   of product variety and lead time in the competition. In contrast to the
   previous literature, we find that increasing the variety will not
   intensify the price competition if there is sufficient firm
   differentiation. Rather, it relieves the price pressure for the firm as
   it satisfies consumer needs better and enables higher price premiums. We
   also analyze the impact of asymmetric variable costs, fixed costs, and
   brand reputation on the equilibrium decisions.

AB Although previous research demonstrates the profitability of partial
   refund policies in a monopoly setting, there is a certain lack of
   ubiquity in practice about these refunds in competitive service markets.
   This raises the question of how a partial refund policy may work and
   whether it is even sustainable in a competitive environment. This study
   investigates how competition may influence the profitability and the
   equilibrium choice of refund policies. It is shown that partial refunds
   may endogenously change the nature of strategic interaction between
   service providers from local monopolies into a competition regime, which
   moderates the gains from exploiting the efficiency-enhancing effect of
   partial refunds. A whole range of pure-strategy equilibria can be
   obtained as a result of the interplay between the efficiency-improving
   and the competition-intensifying effects. When the capacity is small
   (large) such that the efficiency-improving (the
   competition-intensifying) effect is dominant, both firms in equilibrium
   follow identical partial (zero) refund policies. Moreover,
   interestingly, the symmetric firms may end up in an asymmetric
   equilibrium in which one firm follows a partial refund policy and the
   other adopts a zero refund policy.

AB In spite of the fact that many durable products are sold through
   dealers, the literature has largely ignored the issue of how product
   durability affects the interactions between a manufacturer and her
   dealers. We seek to fill this gap by considering a durable goods
   manufacturer that uses independent dealers to get her product to
   consumers. In contrast to much of the literature, we specifically
   consider the possibility that if the manufacturer sells her product,
   then the dealers can either sell or lease it to the final consumer. One
   of our more interesting findings is that, when the level of competition
   among dealers is high, the manufacturer prefers to use a lease-brokering
   arrangement in which the dealers earn a margin for brokering leases
   between the manufacturer and end consumers, instead of selling her
   product to the dealers. This complements existing results that show that
   when suppliers of durable goods interact directly with consumers,
   selling is the dominant strategy for high levels of competitive
   intensity.

AB The act of trading in a used car as partial payment for a new car
   resonates with practically all consumers. Such transactions are
   prevalent in many other durable goods markets, ranging from golf clubs
   to CT scanners. What roles do trade-ins play in these markets? What
   motivates the seller to set up a channel to facilitate trade-ins?
   Intuitively, accepting a trade-in would appear to stimulate demand for
   the producer's product, but facilitating the resale of these used goods
   that substitute for new goods might also increase cannibalization.
   Although such transactions involve billions of dollars, we know
   relatively little about this practice from the extant research
   literature.
   This paper develops an analytical model that incorporates key features
   of real-world durable goods markets: (i) coexistence of new and used
   goods markets, (ii) consumer heterogeneity with respect to quality
   sensitivity, (iii) firms that anticipate the cannibalization problem
   arising from the coexistence of new and used goods, and (iv) lemon
   problems in resale markets, whereby sellers of used goods are better
   informed than buyers about the quality of their particular item.
   In our analysis, a trade-in policy amounts to an intervention by the
   firm in the used goods market, which reduces inefficiencies arising from
   the lemon problem. It motivates owners to purchase new goods and reduces
   their proclivity to hold on to purchased goods because of the low price
   the latter would fetch in a lemon market.
   We also show that trade-in programs are more valuable for less reliable
   products, as well as for products that deteriorate more slowly. Our
   analysis shows that producers in durable goods markets should consider
   trade-in programs as a matter of routine. Despite cannibalization
   concerns arising from a more active resale market, a producer's profits
   will inevitably rise from introducing trade-ins, given pervasive lemon
   problems. We test the key predictions of the model about price and
   volume of trade by assembling a data set of transactions of U. S.
   automobile consumers and find broad support for our model.

   developed that identifies latent logo clusters while accounting for
   heterogeneity in evaluations. The concomitant variable approach allows
   cluster probabilities to be country specific. Rather than a priori
   defined clusters, our procedure provides a posteriori cross-national
   logo clusters based on consumer response similarity. Our model reduces
   the 10 countries to three cross-national clusters that respond
   differently to logo design dimensions: the West, Asia, and Russia. The
   dimensions underlying design are found to be similar across countries,
   suggesting that elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony are universal
   design dimensions. Responses (affect, shared meaning, subjective
   familiarity, and true and false recognition) to logo design dimensions
   (elaborateness, naturalness, and harmony) and elements (repetition,

AB In his July-August 2007 editorial of Marketing Science, Steven Shugan
   argues that the realism of assumptions does not matter as long as a
   theory or model produces satisfactory predictions and claims further
   that unrealistic assumptions breed good theories. This commentary
   discusses the problems of his argument and presents a very different
   view about the realism of assumptions.
   Assumptions need not be realistic if the only goal of science is
   prediction. However, a major function of theory is also to explain and
   not just to predict. The role of explanation is more important in the
   social sciences because it is far more difficult to produce accurate
   predictions in the social than the natural sciences. Assumptions,
   especially core assumptions, often constitute the foundation of the
   mechanismic explanations provided by a theory. Unrealistic assumptions
   may lead to faulty explanations and false predictions.
   Contrary to Shugan's view, the realism of an assumption cannot be
   assessed just based on the output of a theory. It has to be tested
   independently of or in conjunction with the hypotheses of the theory.
   Also, contrary to Shugan's claim, more realistic assumptions result in
   better theories. As theory development advances, efforts should be
   directed toward making assumptions more realistic.

AB Remember James Boswell, ninth Laird of Auchinleck, author of the famous
   maxim that the road to hell is paved with good intentions? Trying to
   build realistic theories differs dramatically from having correct
   explanatory theories tested on objective criteria, e. g., veri. able
   prediction. Evaluating theories on whether assumptions are realistic is
   potentially subjective, biased, and arbitrary. A theory's domain
   determines whether its assumptions are sufficiently realistic and when
   assumptions must hold and to what degree, so testing assumptions in
   isolation puts an unnecessary burden on the assumptions (i.e., they must
   hold everywhere). For theories explaining cooperation and information
   exchange, predictions reveal that the prisoner's dilemma assumptions
   (only two prisoners, four possible outcomes, two possible actions, etc.)
   are sufficiently realistic. For theories explaining prisoner sentencing
   guidelines and probation policy, predictions might suggest otherwise.
   Scientific methods allow the evaluation of theories on criteria such
   predictive accuracy, reliability, validity, and robustness-not based on
   realism. When multiple explanatory theories survive initial testing, one
   derives conflicting predictions. For example, a theory that people are
   broccoli produces correct predictions (people are mortal) and incorrect
   predictions (people are biennial). Tragic consequences can occur when
   theory adoption depends on whether assumptions are disliked, unpopular,
   or exclude a favorite variable. Denounce journals that reject models
   with insightful new implications because the assumptions are too simple
   or merely disliked. The term "unrealistic" sometimes means personally
   disliked.

AB In the response to my commentary on his 2007 editorial entitled "It's
   the Findings, Stupid, Not the Assumptions," Steven Shugan raises a
   number of thought-provoking ideas. In this rejoinder, I focus on three
   issues that Shugan and I hold the most divergent views.
   First, while Shugan uses the terms "realistic" and "realism" in several
   different meanings, I de. ne the realism of an assumption as the extent
   to which it corresponds with the real world. Second, Shugan makes a
   strong claim that predictions can be objectively evaluated whereas
   assumptions cannot. I refute his claim by arguing that testing
   predictions and testing assumptions follow the same research process of
   checking whether the proposition concerned corresponds with reality.
   Third, Shugan maintains that given predictive accuracy, assumptions need
   not be realistic. I hold an opposite view for the obvious reason that
   the same prediction may be generated by completely different mechanisms,
   which in turn are based on different assumptions. Last but not least,
   the example of socialist economic planning shows that unrealistic
   assumptions can generate dangerous theories.

AB Eric Tsang's response makes the legitimate point that prediction and
   explanation can be different goals. However, his arguments also suffer
   from several errors in logic, most often the converse error. I do not
   claim that unrealistic assumptions breed good theories. I only claim
   that breakthrough theories usually have assumptions deemed unrealistic.
   Hence, unrealistic assumptions breed both good and bad theories. That is
   why science tests theories, not assumptions.
   Moreover, one can easily prove that realistic assumptions are not
   required. Consider situations when one of two competing theories must be
   correct. For example, in criminal cases, the prosecution's theory is
   that the accused committed the crime. The defense's theory is that the
   accused is innocent. One theory is correct despite the fact that both
   could make obviously unrealistic assumptions. For example, the
   prosecution might unrealistically assume that unreliable eyewitness
   testimony is sufficient to convict. The defense might unrealistically
   assume that a dubious alibi is sufficient to acquit. Juries decide on
   all the evidence and not each assumption. I now answer some of Eric
   Tsang's questions.

AB In this research, we show that the interaction between territory
   allocation and sales force compensation-two key drivers of sales
   productivity-strongly affects the firm's profitability. We analyze an
   agency-theoretic model that jointly considers the degree of negative or
   positive correlation across territory outcomes, differences in
   territories' sales potentials, the agency problem with risk-averse
   salespeople, and the availability of both own-territory compensation
   elements, such as commission, and elements dependent on the performance
   of others, such as group commissions or tournaments.
   We find that allocating salespeople to negatively correlated sales
   territories beneficially diversifies each salesperson's portfolio of
   sales outcomes when this allocation includes a group commission pay
   component, and can improve profitability even with a decrease in average
   territory sales performance. In a larger sales force, a balanced
   allocation of salespeople, coupled with a group commission, dominates an
   imbalanced allocation. Comparing piece-rate compensation (with or
   without a group commission component) to tournaments alongside the
   allocation problem, we find that tournaments are favored over piece-rate
   plans when territories are highly positively correlated, territory sales
   potentials are similar, and salespeople have a low disutility for effort
   and are not very risk-averse. A piece-rate plan conversely dominates a
   tournament when these conditions are reversed.

AB Consumers set goals to achieve a variety of objectives such as losing
   weight, saving for retirement, and achieving better health. A large body
   of literature in psychology and consumer behavior shows that goals can
   help consumers achieve these objectives. However, there is almost no
   research that examines how we should set optimal goals. The purpose of
   this paper is to develop a parsimonious framework that examines how
   goals can help performance and how we should set optimal goals. We use
   the literature on hyperbolic discounting to model these issues. Our
   results show that goals can often increase performance but can also
   sometimes encourage procrastination. We show that some goals are worse
   than having no goals, even when the goals are achieved and the consumer
   exerts more effort because of the goal. We also find that the presence
   of goals can lead to myopic consumers behaving as if they were
   hyperopic. Our results also show that the most difficult goals should be
   assigned to consumers with moderate levels of motivation and
   self-control problems. We also find that it is sometimes optimal to set
   goals that are never achieved.

AB Prices for goods such as blades for razors, ink for printers, and
   concessions at movies are often set well above cost. Theory has shown
   that this could yield a profitable price discrimination strategy often
   termed "metering." The idea is that a customer's intensity of demand for
   aftermarket goods (e.g., the concessions) provides a meter of how much
   the customer is willing to pay for the primary good (e.g., admission).
   If this correlation in tastes for the two goods is positive, a high
   price on the aftermarket good allows firms to extract a greater total
   price (admissions plus concessions) from higher-type customers. This
   paper develops a simple aggregate model of discrete-continuous demand to
   motivate how this correlation can be tested using simple regression
   techniques and readily available firm data. Model simulations illustrate
   that the regressions can be used to predict whether aftermarket prices
   should be above, below, or equal to their marginal cost. We then apply
   the approach to box office and concession data from a chain of Spanish
   theaters and find that high-priced concessions do extract more surplus
   from customers with a greater willingness to pay for the admission
   ticket.

AB The concept of one-to-one marketing is intuitively appealing, but there
   is little research that investigates the value of individual-level
   marketing relative to segment-level or mass marketing. In this paper, we
   investigate the financial benefits of and computational challenges
   involved in one-to-one marketing. The analysis uses data from an online
   grocery and drug retailer. Like many retailers, this firm uses multiple
   promotional instruments including discount coupons, free shipping
   offers, and a loyalty program. We investigate the impact of customizing
   these promotions on the two most important consumer decisions: the
   decision to buy from the store and expenditure. Our modeling approach
   accounts for two sources of heterogeneity in consumers' responsiveness
   to various marketing mix elements: cross-sectional differences across
   consumers and temporal differences within consumers based on the
   purchase cycle. The model parameter estimates are fed into a dynamic
   programming model that determines the optimal number, sequence, and
   timing of promotions to maximize retailer profits. A series of policy
   simulations show that customizing promotions leads to a significant
   increase in profits relative to the firm's current practice of uniform
   promotions. However, the effectiveness of various promotions varies
   because of both cross-sectional differences in consumers as well within
   consumer heterogeneity due to purchase cycle factors. For instance, we
   find that free shipping tends to be the preferred instrument for
   re-acquiring lapsed customers, whereas an across-the-board price cut
   (via a discount coupon) is the most effective tool for managing the
   segment of most active customers. Interestingly, we find that
   customizing based on within-customer temporal heterogeneity contributes
   more to profitability than exploiting variations across consumers. This
   is important because the computational burden of implementing the
   dynamic optimization to account for cross-sectional heterogeneity is far
   greater than accounting for temporal heterogeneity. Furthermore,
   targeting promotions based only on timing rather than the nature and
   magnitude of the offers across consumers alleviates the public relations
   risks of price discrimination. Implications for marketing managers are
   also discussed.

AB Online retailing boasts two major advantages: convenience of home
   shopping and easy access to information. In this paper, I argue that
   these two features have important implications for retailers' channel
   and advertising decisions. Two major questions are addressed: When
   should a conventional bricks-and-mortar retailer adopt a multichannel
   strategy? When should a multichannel retailer use its website to
   advertise offline prices? Analysis shows that the answers hinge on the
   nature of the product, the retailer's costs, and the competitors'
   strategies as well as the competitiveness of the market. Multichannel
   retailing is not necessarily the best strategy for all retailers; no
   adoption, asymmetric adoption, and symmetric adoption of the strategy
   are all possible equilibria. Advertising the in-store prices online is
   not always optimal. Price advertising in multichannel retailing has a
   different effect when compared with conventional single-channel
   retailing. It helps coordinate the channels by shifting the sales from
   online to offline, which is particularly useful when margins online are
   relatively low. The finding that multichannel retailers can benefit from
   drawing consumers back to physical stores highlights the risk of
   boosting online sales without considering the adverse effect on the
   offline channel and indicates a shifting role of the Web in retailers'
   businesses.

AB Brands often form alliances to enhance their brand equities. In this
   paper, we examine the alliances between professional athletes (athlete
   brands) and sports teams (team brands) in the National Basketball
   Association (NBA). Athletes and teams match to maximize the total added
   value created by the brand alliance. To understand this total value, we
   estimate a structural two-sided matching model using a maximum score
   method. Using data on the free-agency contracts signed in the NBA during
   the four-year period from 1994 to 1997, we find that both older players
   and players with higher performance are more likely to match with teams
   with more wins. However, controlling for performance, we find that brand
   alliances between high brand equity players (defined as receiving enough
   votes to be an all-star starter) and medium brand equity teams (defined
   by stadium and broadcast revenues) generate the highest value. This
   suggests that top brands are not necessarily best off matching with
   other top brands. We also provide suggestive evidence that the maximum
   salary policy implemented in 1998 influenced matches based on brand
   equity spillovers more than matches based on performance
   complementarities.

AB The purpose of this article is to analyze how competitive forces may
   influence the way media firms like TV channels raise revenue. A media
   firm can either be financed by advertising revenue, by direct payment
   from the viewers (or the readers, if we consider newspapers), or by
   both. We show that the scope for raising revenues from consumer payment
   is constrained by other media firms offering close substitutes. This
   implies that the less differentiated the media firms' content, the
   larger is the fraction of their revenue coming from advertising. A media
   firm's scope for raising revenues from ads, on the other hand, is
   constrained by how many competitors it faces. We should thus expect that
   direct payment from the media consumers becomes more important the
   larger the number of competing media products.

AB Manufacturers often have a choice of whether to advertise something
   positive about their own products without mentioning their rivals'
   products (a noncomparative ad) or whether to portray their rivals
   negatively in addition to promoting their own products (a comparative
   ad). In this paper we ask: First, if a manufacturer in a distribution
   channel can choose between a comparative ad and a noncomparative ad, all
   else being equal, which should it choose? Second, under what conditions
   would a manufacturer want to reinforce its advertising message at the
   point of sale with in-store displays, and when should the retailer allow
   the displays? Third, how does the possibility of in-store displays
   influence the manufacturer's choice of ad content? We find that a
   manufacturer will prefer to run comparative ads over noncomparative ads
   for advertising that is untargeted or that appeals primarily to the
   manufacturer's core consumers, and run noncomparative ads over
   comparative ads for advertising that appeals primarily to the rival's
   core consumers. We also find that in-store displays will be optimal for
   the manufacturer and its retailers if and only if they increase the
   overall joint profit of the retailer, the manufacturer, and its rival.
   Finally, we find that the possibility of offering in-store displays
   increases a manufacturer's incentive to run noncomparative ads. However,
   some comparative ads may be so attractive to the manufacturer that it
   will run them with or without retailer help. Our paper is the first to
   introduce a channel-based explanation for why manufacturers may or may
   not want to engage in comparative advertising.

   elicits counteractions from competing manufacturers and consequently
   leads to wasteful cancellation of the advertising effects. Thus,
   persuasive advertising is widely perceived to be combative in nature. A
   series of previously published papers demonstrates that appropriate
   targeting may partially mitigate the combative nature of persuasive
   advertising in that either the rival manufacturer or the retailer may
   benefit. In this paper, we complement their results by demonstrating the
   possibility that every channel member may benefit from persuasive
   advertising, i.e., a Pareto improvement along the distribution channel,
   thereby leading to the conclusion that persuasive advertising need not

AB Analysts often rely on methods that presume constant stochastic
   variance, even though its degree can differ markedly across experimental
   and field settings. This reliance can lead to misestimation of effect
   sizes or unjustified theoretical or behavioral inferences. Classic
   utility-based discrete-choice theory makes sharp, testable predictions
   about how observed choice patterns should change when stochastic
   variance differs across items, brands, or conditions. We derive and
   examine the implications of assuming constant stochastic variance for
   choices made under different conditions or at different times, in
   particular, whether substantive effects can arise purely as artifacts.
   These implications are tested via an experiment designed to isolate the
   effects of stochastic variation in choice behavior. Results strongly
   suggest that the stochastic component should be carefully modeled to
   differ across both available brands and temporal conditions, and that
   its variance may be relatively greater for choices made for the future.
   The experimental design controls for several alternative mechanisms
   (e.g., flexibility seeking), and a series of related models suggest that
   several econometrically detectable explanations like correlated error,
   state dependence, and variety seeking add no explanatory power. A series
   of simulations argues for appropriate flexibility in discrete-choice
   specification when attempting to detect temporal stochastic inflation
   effects.

   and testing in the field of intertemporal choice analysis is explored.
   Although supporting the overall thrust of Salisbury and Feinberg's
   critique of previous empirical work in the area, we also see their paper
   as illustrating the dangers of drawing strong inferences about the
   behavioral interpretation of statistical model parameters without
   seeking convergent empirical evidence. In particular, we are skeptical
   about the extent to which the reported effects of temporal distance on
   the estimated scale parameter, sigma(c), are uniquely, or even
   primarily, due to unobserved error inflation that reflects consumer's
   uncertainty about future utility. This interpretation is brought into
   question by several lines of reasoning. Conceptually, we note that
   "uncertainty" is different from "error" and that, for choice data, the
   error inflation model is mathematically identical to a model in which
   the scale parameter is a deterministic function of the temporal discount
   rate. Empirically, a reanalysis of data from previously published
   experiments does not consistently support temporal error inflation,
   temporal convergence of choice shares, or the scale parameter as an
   explanation of variety seeking in choice sequences. In our opinion, the
   cumulative results of research on intertemporal choice require models in
   which the attributes of choice alternatives are differentially
   discounted over time. Despite these findings, we advocate that choice
   researchers should indeed follow Salisbury and Feinberg's advice to not
   assume that error variances will be unaffected by experimental
   manipulations, and such effects should be explicitly modeled. We also
   agree that uncovering effects on error variance is just the first step,
   and the ultimate goal should be to rigorously explain the reasons for
   such effects.

   other factors that facilitate the description and management of
   trade-up. Our model allows advertising to affect the relative
   superiority or inferiority of products. This allows for a wide variety
   of trade-up patterns beyond those obtained from a standard random
   utility formulation of the logit model. Our nonhomothetic model allows
   for advertising to affect more than just brand intercepts (perceived
   quality), but also the rate at which consumers are willing to trade up
   to higher-quality brands. Advertising effects are measured using a
   randomized treatment and evaluated by considering their direct
   implications for firm pricing and profits.

AB This research aims to provide insights into the determinants of channel
   profitability and the relative power in the channel by considering
   consumer demand and the interactions between manufacturers and retailers
   in an equilibrium model. We use the Nash bargaining solution to
   determine wholesale prices and thus how margins are split in the
   channel. Equilibrium margins are a function of demand primitives and of
   retailer and manufacturer bargaining power. Bargaining power is itself a
   function of exogenous retail and manufacturer characteristics. The
   parties' bargaining positions are determined endogenously from the
   estimated substitution patterns on the demand side. The more they have
   to lose in a negotiation relative to an outside option, the weaker the
   bargaining position.
   We use the proposed bargaining model to investigate the role of the
   three main factors that have been blamed for the power shift from
   manufacturers to retailers in recent years (firm-size increases,
   store-brand introductions, and service-level differentiation). In our
   empirical analysis of the German market for coffee, we find that
   bargaining power varies among the different manufacturer-retailer pairs.
   This result suggests that bargaining power is not an inherent
   characteristic of a firm but rather depends on the negotiation partner.
   We are able to confirm empirically previous theoretical findings that
   there can be cases where the slice of the pie that goes to one of the
   channel members may decrease, but the overall pie increases and
   compensates for the smaller share of profits.

AB The past few years have seen increasing interest in taking the notion of
   customer lifetime value (CLV) and extending it to value a customer base
   (with subsequent links to corporate valuation). The application of
   standard textbook discussions of CLV leads to calculations based on a
   single retention rate. However, at the cohort level, retention rates
   typically increase over time. It has been suggested that these observed
   dynamics are due, in large part, to a sorting effect in a heterogeneous
   population. We show that failing to recognize these dynamics yields a
   downward-biased estimate of the residual value of the customer base
   (compared to an aggregate analysis that ignores these dynamics). We also
   explore the implications of failing to account for retention dynamics
   when computing retention elasticities and find that the frequently
   reported values underestimate the true effect of increases in underlying
   retention rates in a heterogeneous world.

AB We study the effects of retailer in-store media on distribution channel
   relationships. Retailers open in-store media (ISM) and allow
   manufacturers to advertise to shoppers. Our results suggest that ISM has
   an important role in coordinating a distribution channel on advertising
   volume and product sales, and on mitigating supplier competition.
   Improved channel coordination is achieved through the internalization of
   advertising decisions from commercial forms of media (e.g., radio, TV,
   newspaper). A retailer may strategically subsidize manufacturers for
   their advertising on ISM. This subsidy is optimal even if ISM is more
   effective than commercial media. With manufacturer competition, a
   retailer can strategically use a "competitive premium" to ration
   excessive advertising between competing suppliers in a category. When
   manufacturers are asymmetric with preadvertising brand awareness, a
   retailer has an incentive to price discriminate by charging lower prices
   to manufacturers whose brand awareness is higher.

AB Referral bonuses, in which an existing customer gets an in-kind or cash
   reward for referring a new customer, are a popular way to stimulate word
   of mouth. In this paper, we examine key firm decisions about such
   bonuses. Others have studied referral bonus programs; a key difference
   is that we study the role of recommendations not just in spreading
   awareness (as they do) but also in providing assessments. We start with
   the idea that people have a variety of reasons for making product
   recommendations, including placing a value on a friend's outcome with a
   product they recommend. We apply that idea in a context of asymmetric
   information: A customer combines his knowledge about the product and his
   familiarity with friends' tastes, making him more informed than the
   friends. Thus, the recommendation is a signal about the value of the
   product to the friend. In this setting, we consistently find that the
   greater the concern for others' outcomes, the higher the referral bonus
   should be, as long as the firm cannot more efficiently motivate
   recommendations with a lower price. Moreover, if price is the more
   efficient lever, the optimal bonus is zero, and the optimal price is
   low. We also show that greater concern tends to reduce firm profit and,
   in some cases, actually reduces consumer welfare as well.

AB This paper examines the interaction of information provision, product
   quality, and pricing decisions by competitive firms to explore the
   following question: in a competitive market where consumers face
   uncertainty about product quality and/or their preference for quality,
   which firms-those that sell higher- or lower-quality products-have the
   higher incentive to provide what type of information? We find that while
   the higher-quality firm should always provide information resolving
   consumer uncertainty on product quality, the lower-quality firm under
   certain conditions will have the higher incentive to and will be the one
   to provide information resolving consumer uncertainty about their
   quality preferences. In the analysis, we trace the latter result to
   competition and to free-riding on the information provision.
   Specifically, in a monopoly market or when consumer free-riding is
   restricted by the costliness of store visits, the lower-quality firm
   would have a lower incentive to provide information resolving consumer
   preference uncertainty than otherwise. The model is also adapted to
   examine product returns as a possible strategy of information provision.

AB Choice decisions in the marketplace are often made by a collection of

   preferences of the individuals that constitute the group. For a

   methodology to estimate joint preference without the need to collect
   joint data from the group members. Our methodology makes use of both
   stated and inferred preference measures, and merges experimental design,
   statistical modeling, and utility aggregation theories to capture the
   psychological processes of preference revision and concession that lead
   to the joint preference. Results based on a study involving a cell phone

AB Many consumer durable retailers often do not advertise their prices and
   instead ask consumers to call them for prices. It is easy to see that
   this practice increases the consumers' cost of learning the prices of
   products they are considering, yet firms commonly use such practices.
   Not advertising prices may reduce the firm's advertising costs, but the
   strategic effects of doing so are not clear. Our objective is to examine
   the strategic effects of this practice. In particular, how does making
   price discovery more difficult for consumers affect competing retailers'
   price, service decisions, and profits?
   We develop a model in which a manufacturer sells its product through a
   high-service retailer and a low-service retailer. Consumers can purchase
   the retail service at the high-end retailer and purchase the product at
   the competing low-end retailer. Therefore, the high-end retailer faces a
   free-riding problem. A retailer first chooses its optimal service
   levels. Then, it chooses its optimal price levels. Finally, a retailer
   decides whether to advertise its prices. The model results in four
   structures: (1) both retailers advertise prices, (2) only the
   low-service retailer advertises price, (3) only the high-service
   retailer advertises price, and (4) neither retailer advertises price.
   We find that when a retailer does not advertise its price and makes
   price discovery more difficult for consumers, the competition between
   the retailers is less intense. However, the retailer is forced to charge
   a lower price. In addition, if the competing retailer does advertise its
   prices, then the competing retailer enjoys higher profit margins. We
   identify conditions under which each of the above four structures is an
   equilibrium and show that a low-service retailer not advertising its
   price is a more likely outcome than a high-service retailer doing so. We
   then solve the manufacturer's problem and find that there are several
   instances when a retailer's advertising decisions are different from
   what the manufacturer would want. We describe the nature of this channel
   coordination problem and identify some solutions.

AB We examine two questions: Does the roundness or precision of prices bias
   magnitude judgments? If so, do these biased judgments affect buyer
   behavior? Results from five studies suggest that buyers underestimate
   the magnitudes of precise prices. We term this the precision effect. The
   first three studies are laboratory experiments designed to test the
   existence of the precision effect and examine the underlying
   psychological processes. In Study 1, we find that precise prices are
   judged to be smaller than round prices of similar magnitudes. For
   example, participants in this experiment incorrectly judged $395,425 to
   be smaller than $395,000. In Study 2, we show that precision is more
   likely to affect magnitude judgments under conditions of uncertainty.
   Study 3 demonstrates that manipulating prior experience with the pattern
   of roundness and precision in numbers can moderate the precision effect.
   Studies 4 and 5 examine whether the precision effect influences buyers'
   willingness to pay for negotiated purchases (e.g., houses). In Study 4,
   we conduct an experiment on a nationally representative sample of
   homeowners to demonstrate that participants are willing to pay more for
   houses when the sellers use precise (e.g., $364,578) instead of
   comparable round (e.g., $365,000) prices. In Study 5, we analyze data
   from residential real estate transactions in two separate markets and
   find that buyers pay higher sale prices when list prices are more
   precise. These empirical results enrich our understanding of the
   psychological processes that underlie price magnitude judgments and have
   substantive implications for buyer and seller behavior.

AB Paid placements on search engines reached sales of nearly $11 billion in
   the United States last year and represent the most rapidly growing form
   of online advertising today. In its classic form, a search engine sets
   up an auction for each search word in which competing websites bid for
   their sponsored links to be displayed next to the search results. We
   model this advertising market, focusing on two of its key
   characteristics: (1) the interaction between the list of search results
   and the list of sponsored links on the search page and (2) the inherent
   differences in attractiveness between sites. We find that both of these
   special aspects of search advertising have a significant effect on
   sites' bidding behavior and the equilibrium prices of sponsored links.
   Often, sites that are not among the most popular ones obtain the
   sponsored links, especially if the marginal return of sites on clicks is
   quickly decreasing and if consumers do not trust sponsored links. In
   three extensions, we also explore (1) heterogeneous valuations across
   bidding sites, (2) the endogenous choice of the number of sponsored
   links that the search engine sells, and (3) a dynamic model where
   websites' bidding behavior is a function of their previous positions on
   the sponsored list. Our results shed light on the seemingly random order
   of sites on search engines' list of sponsored links and their variation
   over time. They also provide normative insights for both buyers and
   sellers of search advertising.

AB This paper develops a framework for measuring "tipping"-the increase in
   a firm's market share dominance caused by indirect network effects. Our
   measure compares the expected concentration in a market to the
   hypothetical expected concentration that would arise in the absence of
   indirect network effects. In practice, this measure requires a model
   that can predict the counterfactual market concentration under different
   parameter values capturing the strength of indirect network effects. We
   build such a model for the case of dynamic standards competition in a
   market characterized by the classic hardware/software paradigm. To
   demonstrate its applicability, we calibrate it using demand estimates
   and other data from the 32/64-bit generation of video game consoles, a
   canonical example of standards competition with indirect network
   effects. In our example, we find that indirect network effects can lead
   to a strong, economically significant increase in market concentration.
   We also find important roles for beliefs on both the demand side, as
   consumers tend to pick the product they expect to win the standards war,
   and on the supply side, as firms engage in penetration pricing to invest
   in growing their networks.

AB Packaged goods manufacturers spend in excess of $75 billion annually on
   trade promotions, even though their effectiveness has been hotly debated
   by academics and practitioners for decades. One reason for this ongoing
   debate is that empirical research has been limited mostly to case
   studies, managerial surveys, and data from one or two supermarket chains
   in a single market. In this paper, we assemble a unique data set
   containing information on prices, quantities, and promotions throughout
   the entire channel in a category. Our study extends the empirical
   literature on pass-through in three important ways. First, we
   investigate how pass-through varies across more than 1,000 retailers in
   over 30 states. Second, we study pass-through at multiple levels of the
   distribution channel. Third, we show how the use of accounting metrics,
   such as average acquisition cost, rather than transaction cost, yields
   biased estimates of pass-through and therefore overstates the
   effectiveness of trade promotions.
   We find that mean pass-through elasticities are 0.71, 0.59, and 0.41,
   for the wholesaler, retailer, and total channel, respectively. More
   importantly, at each level of the channel we observe large variances in
   pass-through estimates that we explain using various measures of cost
   and competition. Surprisingly, we find that market structure and
   competition have a relatively small impact on pass-through.
   We conclude by showing how the profitability of manufacturer and
   wholesaler deals can be improved by utilizing detailed effectiveness
   estimates. For example, a manufacturer using an inclusive trade
   promotion strategy might offer a 10% off invoice deal to all retailers
   on every product. This strategy would decrease manufacturer and
   wholesaler profits for 56% of product/store combinations, whereas
   retailers experience a profit boost in 96% of cases. Manufacturers and
   wholesalers can avoid unprofitable trade deals for specific products and
   retailers by utilizing estimates of pass-through, consumer price
   elasticity, and margins. Compared to the inclusive strategy, such a
   selective trade promotion strategy would improve deal profitability by
   80% and reduce costs by 40%.

AB During the summer of 2005, the three domestic U. S. automobile
   manufacturers offered a customer promotion that allowed customers to buy
   new cars using discount programs formerly offered only to employees. The
   initial months of the promotion were record sales months for each of the
   three firms, suggesting that customers thought that the prices offered
   during the promotion were particularly attractive. In reality, however,
   many customers paid higher prices under the employee discount pricing
   promotion. We propose that the promotion changed customers' beliefs
   about current versus future prices, convincing them to purchase during
   the promotion rather than delay in anticipation of future discounts. We
   investigate several alternative explanations for the simultaneous
   increase in prices and sales, including advertising, decreased financing
   costs, industry trends, disutility of bargaining, consumer differences,
   and changes in trade-in values. None of these explanations fully
   explains the concomitant increase in prices and sales.

   technology product categories that incorporates the following aspects
   unique to technology product purchases. First, it accounts for
   consumers' anticipation of declining prices (or increasing quality) over
   time. Second, the durable nature of technology products implies that
   even if two categories are related as complements, consumers may stagger
   their purchases over several periods. Third, the forward-looking
   consumer decision process, as well as the durable nature of technology
   products, implies that a consumer's purchase in one category will depend
   on the anticipated price and quality trajectories of all categories. As
   a potential aid to future researchers, we also lay out the data
   requirements for empirically estimating the parameters of our model and
   the consequences of not having various elements of these data on our
   ability to estimate the parameters. The data available for our empirical
   analysis are household-level information on category-level first-time
   adoption decisions in three categories-personal computers, digital
   cameras, and printers. Our results reveal a strong complementary
   relationship between the three categories. Policy simulations based on a
   temporary price decrease in any one category provide interesting
   insights into how consumers would modify their adoption behavior over
   time and also across categories as a consequence of the price decrease.

AB Mere observation of others' choices can be informative about product
   quality. This paper develops an individual-level dynamic model of
   observational learning and applies it to a novel data set from the U. S.
   kidney market, where transplant candidates on a waiting list
   sequentially decide whether to accept a kidney offer. We find strong
   evidence of observational learning: patients draw negative quality
   inferences from earlier refusals in the queue, thus becoming more
   inclined towards refusal themselves. This self-reinforcing chain of
   inferences leads to poor kidney utilization despite the continual
   shortage in kidney supply. Counterfactual policy simulations show that
   patients would have made more efficient use of kidneys had the concerns
   behind earlier refusals been shared. This study yields a set of
   marketing implications. In particular, we show that observational
   learning and information sharing shape consumer choices in markedly
   different ways. Optimal marketing strategies should take into account
   how consumers learn from others.

AB In a viral marketing campaign, an organization develops a marketing
   message and encourages customers to forward this message to their
   contacts. Despite its increasing popularity, there are no models yet
   that help marketers to predict how many customers a viral marketing
   campaign will reach and how marketers can influence this process through
   marketing activities. This paper develops such a model using the theory
   of branching processes. The proposed viral branching model allows
   customers to participate in a viral marketing campaign by (1) opening a
   seeding e-mail from the organization, (2) opening a viral e-mail from a
   friend, and (3) responding to other marketing activities such as banners
   and offline advertising. The model parameters are estimated using
   individual-level data that become available in large quantities in the
   early stages of viral marketing campaigns. The viral branching model is
   applied to an actual viral marketing campaign in which over 200,000
   customers participated during a six-week period. The results show that
   the model quickly predicts the actual reach of the campaign. In
   addition, the model proves to be a valuable tool to evaluate alternative
   what-if scenarios.

AB The mixed or heterogeneous multinomial logit (MIXL) model has become
   popular in a number of fields, especially marketing, health economics,
   and industrial organization. In most applications of the model, the
   vector of consumer utility weights on product attributes is assumed to
   have a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution in the population. Thus,
   some consumers care more about some attributes than others, and the IIA
   property of multinomial logit (MNL) is avoided (i.e., segments of
   consumers will tend to switch among the subset of brands that possess
   their most valued attributes). The MIXL model is also appealing because
   it is relatively easy to estimate. Recently, however, some researchers
   have argued that the MVN is a poor choice for modelling taste
   heterogeneity. They argue that much of the heterogeneity in attribute
   weights is accounted for by a pure scale effect (i.e., across consumers,
   all attribute weights are scaled up or down in tandem). This implies
   that choice behaviour is simply more random for some consumers than
   others (i.e., holding attribute coefficients fixed, the scale of their
   error term is greater). This leads to a "scale heterogeneity" MNL model
   (S-MNL). Here, we develop a generalized multinomial logit model (G-MNL)
   that nests S-MNL and MIXL. By estimating the S-MNL, MIXL, and G-MNL
   models on 10 data sets, we provide evidence on their relative
   performance. We find that models that account for scale heterogeneity
   (i.e., G-MNL or S-MNL) are preferred to MIXL by the Bayes and consistent
   Akaike information criteria in all 10 data sets. Accounting for scale
   heterogeneity enables one to account for "extreme" consumers who exhibit
   nearly lexicographic preferences, as well as consumers who exhibit very
   "random" behaviour (in a sense we formalize below).

AB This paper examines demand elasticities using an integrated framework
   proposed by Hanemann [Hanemann, M. W. 1984. Discrete/continuous models
   of consumer demand. Econometrica 52(3) 541-561], which models the
   incidence, brand choice, and quantity decisions of a consumer as an
   outcome of her utility maximization subject to budget constraints.
   Although the Hanemann framework has been the mainstay of earlier efforts
   to examine these decisions jointly, empirical researchers who have used
   the it to study purchase behavior have often found that the quantity
   elasticities are around -1, regardless of the brand or category. We
   attempt to uncover the underlying reasons for this finding and propose
   approaches to get as close to the "true" quantity elasticities as
   possible. We do this by (i) analytically demonstrating how assumptions
   on the distribution of the brand-specific econometrician's errors imply
   certain restrictions that in turn force quantity elasticities to -1,
   (ii) discussing how these restrictions can be alleviated by considering
   a suitable specification of unobserved parameter heterogeneity, and
   (iii) using scanner data to empirically illustrate the impact of the
   restrictions on quantity elasticities and the relative efficacy of
   multiple specifications of unobserved heterogeneity in easing those
   restrictions. We find that the specification of unobserved heterogeneity
   crucially influences estimates of quantity elasticities and that the
   mixture normal specification outperforms the alternatives.

AB We introduce and test a behavioral model of consumer product search that
   extends a baseline normative model of sequential search by incorporating
   nonnormative influences that are local in the sense that they reflect
   consumers' undue sensitivity to recently encountered alternatives. We
   propose two types of such local behavioral influences that, at each
   stage of a search process, can manifest themselves both in which of the
   products inspected up to that point is deemed to be the most preferred
   one ( the product comparison decision) and whether to terminate the
   search at that stage ( the stopping decision). The first of these
   influences is that consumers respond excessively to the attractiveness
   of the currently inspected product, at the expense of all others
   ("focalism"). The second proposed behavioral influence is that consumers
   overreact to the difference in attractiveness between the current
   product and the one encountered just prior to it ("local contrast").
   Converging evidence from two experiments, which combine to guarantee
   both high internal and high external validity, provides support for the
   proposed behavioral influences. Our findings demonstrate that consumers'
   product comparison and stopping decisions in sequential product search
   are jointly governed by normative principles and by the proposed local
   behavioral influences.

AB The price-aggressive discount format, popularized by chains such as Aldi
   and Lidl, is very successful in most Western economies. Its success is a
   major source of concern for traditional supermarkets. Discounters not
   only have a direct effect on supermarkets' market shares, but they also
   exert considerable pressure to improve operational efficiency and/or to
   decrease prices.
   We use an empirical entry model to study the degree of intra- and
   interformat competition between discounters and supermarkets.
   Information on the competitive impact of new entrants is derived from
   the observed entry decisions of supermarkets and discounters in a large
   cross section of local markets, after controlling for a number of local
   market characteristics. In our modeling framework, we endogenize the
   number of retailers and allow for asymmetric intra- and interformat
   competitive effects in a flexible way. We apply our modeling approach to
   the German grocery industry, where the discount format has stabilized
   after two decades of continued growth.
   We find evidence of intense competition within both the supermarket and
   discounter format, although competition between supermarkets is found to
   be more severe. Most importantly, discounters only start to affect the
   profitability of conventional supermarkets from the third entrant
   onwards. This may explain why many retailers rush to add a discount
   chain to their portfolio: early entrants may benefit from the growth of
   the discount-prone segment without cannibalizing the profits of their
   more conventional supermarket stores.

AB Manufacturers can acquire consumer information in a sequential manner
   and influence downstream retail behavior through sharing the acquired
   information. This paper examines the interaction between a
   manufacturer's optimal information acquisition and sharing strategies in
   a vertical relationship, capturing the impacts of both the flexibility
   to sequentially control information collection and the flexibility in ex
   post voluntary sharing. We show that when information acquisition is
   sequential, the manufacturer may not acquire perfect information even if
   it is costless to do so. This self-restriction in information
   acquisition follows from the manufacturer's motivation to strategically
   influence retail behavior. When information acquisition is inflexible
   and constrained to be either zero or perfect information, the
   manufacturer acquires less (more) information under mandatory
   (voluntary) sharing. Moreover, voluntary sharing unambiguously leads to
   more information being generated, because the manufacturer has the
   option to strategically withhold the acquired information that turns out
   to be unfavorable. Finally, the conditions under which the manufacturer
   ex ante prefers a particular sharing format are examined.

AB Panel survey data have been gaining importance in marketing. However,
   one challenge of estimating econometric models based on panel survey
   data is how to account for underreporting; that is, respondents do not
   report behavioral incidences that actually occur. Underreporting is
   especially likely to occur in a panel survey because the data-recording
   mechanism is often tedious, complex, and effortful. The probability of
   underreporting is likely to vary across respondents and also over the
   duration of the survey period. In this paper, we propose a model to
   simultaneously study reported behavioral incidences and partially
   observed actual behavioral incidences. We propose a Bayesian approach
   for estimating the proposed model. We treat those unobserved actual
   behavioral incidences as latent variables, and the Gibbs sampler makes
   it convenient to impute the nonreported consumption incidences along
   with making inferences on other model parameters. Our proposed method
   has two advantages. First, it offers a model-based approach to remove
   the underreporting bias in panel survey data and therefore allows
   marketing researchers to make accurate inferences about consumers'
   actual behavior. Second, the method also offers a natural way to study
   factors that influence respondents' propensity to underreport. Because
   we treat those underreported behavioral incidences as nonmissing at
   random, this underreporting propensity varies across respondents and
   over time. This understanding can help marketing researchers design the
   right strategy to intervene and incentivize respondents to authentically
   report and hence improve the quality of survey data. The proposed model
   and estimation approach are tested on both synthetic data and actual
   panel survey data on consumer-reported beverage-drinking behavior. Our
   analysis suggests that underreporting can significantly mask
   respondents' true behavior.

AB U sed goods markets are currently important transaction channels for
   durable products. For some durable products, such markets first appeared
   when retailers started buying back used products from "old" customers
   and selling them to new ones for a profit (retail used goods market).
   The growth of electronic peer-to-peer (P2P) markets opened up a second,
   frictionless used goods channel where new customers can buy used
   products directly from old customers (P2P used goods market). Both these
   markets compete with the original primary market where retailers sell
   unused products procured from the manufacturer. This paper focuses on
   understanding the role that the sequential emergence of the above two
   used goods markets plays in shaping the product upgrade strategy of the
   manufacturer and the pricing strategy of the primary market retailer in
   the context of a decentralized, dyadic channel dealing with a renewable
   set of consumers. Our analysis establishes that frequent product
   upgrades and rising retail prices in durable product sectors of our
   interest are due to the emergence of the P2P used goods market and how
   the market interacts with the retail used goods source in altering the
   relative powers of the channel partners. Moreover, contrary to popular
   belief, we show that the initial introduction of the retail used goods
   channel actually discourages introduction of new versions and restrains
   the rise in retail prices. We also comment on how the two used goods
   markets affect the profits of the channel partners. We then provide
   empirical support for our theoretical result regarding product upgrades
   using data from the college textbook industry, a durable product that
   fits our model setup.

AB The interest in social networks among marketing scholars and
   practitioners has sharply increased in the last decade. One social
   network of which network scholars increasingly recognize the unique
   value is the academic collaboration (coauthor) network.
   We offer a comprehensive database of the collaboration network among
   marketing scholars over the last 40 years (available at
   http://mktsci.pubs.informs.org). Based on the ProQuest database, it
   documents the social collaboration among researchers in dozens of the
   leading marketing journals, enabling us to create networks of active
   marketing researchers. Unlike most of the published academic
   collaboration research, our database is dynamic and follows the
   evolution of the field over many years.
   In this paper, we describe the database and point to some basic network
   descriptives that lead to interesting research questions. We believe
   this database can be of much value to researchers interested in the
   evolution of social networks over time, as well as the specific
   evolution of the marketing discipline.

AB Prerelease demand forecasting is one of the most crucial yet difficult
   tasks facing marketers in the $60 billion motion picture industry. We
   propose functional shape analysis (FSA) of virtual stock markets (VSMs)
   to address this long-standing challenge. In VSMs, prices of a movie's
   stock reflect the dynamic demand expectations prior to the movie's
   release. Using FSA, we identify a small number of distinguishing shapes,
   e.g., the last-moment velocity spurt, that carry information about a
   movie's future demand and produce early and accurate prerelease
   forecasts.
   We find that although forecasting errors from the existing methods, e.
   g., those that rely on movie features, can be as high as 90.87%, our
   approach results in an error of only 4.73%. Because demand forecasting
   is especially useful for managerial decision making when provided long
   before a movie's release, we further demonstrate how our method can be
   used for early forecasting and compare its power against alternative
   approaches. We also discuss the theoretical implications of the
   discovered shapes that may help managers identify indicators of a
   potentially successful movie early and dynamically.

AB This paper develops a model for the estimation and analysis of demand in
   the context of social interactions. Decisions made by a group of
   customers are modeled to be an equilibrium outcome of an empirical
   discrete game, such that all group members must be satisfied with chosen
   outcomes. The game-theoretic approach assists estimation by allowing us
   to account for the endogeneity of group members' decisions while also
   serving as a managerial tool that can simulate equilibrium outcomes for
   the group when the firm alters the marketing mix to the group. The model
   builds upon the existing literature on empirical models of discrete
   games by introducing a random coefficients heterogeneity distribution.
   Monte Carlo simulations reveal that including the heterogeneity resolves
   the endogenous group formation bias commonly noted in the social
   interactions literature. By estimating the heterogeneous equilibrium
   model using Bayesian hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo, we can also
   recover some parameters at the individual level to evaluate
   group-specific characteristics and targeted marketing strategies. To
   validate the model and illustrate its implications, we apply it to a
   data set of groups of golfers. We find significant social interaction
   effects, such that 65% of the median customer value is attributable to
   the customer and the other 35% is attributable to the customer's affect
   on members of his group. We also consider targeted marketing strategies
   and show that group-level targeting increases profit by 1%, whereas
   targeting within groups can increase profitability by 20%. We recognize
   that customer backlashes to targeting could be greater when group
   members receive different offers, so we suggest some alternatives that
   could retain some of the profitability of within group targeting while
   avoiding customer backlashes.

AB The phenomenon of paid search advertising has now become the most
   predominant form of online advertising in the marketing world. However,
   we have little understanding of the impact of search engine advertising
   on consumers' responses in the presence of organic listings of the same
   firms. In this paper, we model and estimate the interrelationship
   between organic search listings and paid search advertisements. We use a
   unique panel data set based on aggregate consumer response to several
   hundred keywords over a three-month period collected from a major
   nationwide retailer store chain that advertises on Google. In
   particular, we focus on understanding whether the presence of organic
   listings on a search engine is associated with a positive, a negative,
   or no effect on the click-through rates of paid search advertisements,
   and vice versa for a given firm. We first build an integrated model to
   estimate the relationship between different metrics such as search
   volume, click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per click, and
   keyword ranks. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework is used and
   the model is estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Our
   empirical findings suggest that click-throughs on organic listings have
   a positive interdependence with click-throughs on paid listings, and
   vice versa. We also find that this positive interdependence is
   asymmetric such that the impact of organic clicks on increases in
   utility from paid clicks is 3.5 times stronger than the impact of paid
   clicks on increases in utility from organic clicks. Using counterfactual
   experiments, we show that on an average this positive interdependence
   leads to an increase in expected profits for the firm ranging from 4.2%
   to 6.15% when compared to profits in the absence of this
   interdependence. To further validate our empirical results, we also
   conduct and present the results from a controlled field experiment. This
   experiment shows that total click-through rates, conversions rates, and
   revenues in the presence of both paid and organic search listings are
   significantly higher than those in the absence of paid search
   advertisements. The results predicted by the econometric model are also
   corroborated in this field experiment, which suggests a causal
   interpretation to the positive interdependence between paid and organic
   search listings. Given the increased spending on search engine-based
   advertising, our analysis provides critical insights to managers in both
   traditional and Internet firms.

AB Price promotions and bundling have been two of the most widely used
   marketing tools in industry practice. Past literature has assumed that
   firms respond to price promotions by promoting a product in the same
   category. In this paper, we extend this literature as well as the
   bundling literature by considering the possibility that a firm may
   respond to a competitor's price promotions by also offering a
   cross-buying or bundling discount. Using a game-theoretic model, we show
   that bundle discounts can help increase profits in a competitive market
   by creating endogenous loyalty, thereby reducing the intensity of
   promotional competition. We also find that bundle discounts can be used
   as an effective defensive marketing tool to prevent customer defection
   to the competition.

AB With increasing fragmentation of media markets and recent advances in
   technology, loss of advertising effectiveness has been a great concern
   for marketers. For consumers, the digital video recorder (DVR) offers
   the possibility to fast-forward through live programming. Whereas the
   DVR thus benefits consumers by reducing nuisance from commercials,
   industry observers believe that it may diminish advertisers' profits by
   rendering commercials ineffective. We use a model of informative
   advertising to study the effect of DVR penetration on competing
   advertisers' strategies and profits. We find that the overall effect of
   DVRs depends on the trade off between loss of advertising effectiveness
   and reduction in competition between firms. The latter effect arises
   because DVR penetration may increase the ratio of partially informed to
   fully informed consumers. We identify conditions under which an increase
   in DVR penetration counterintuitively leads firms to increase
   advertising levels and enjoy higher profits. Interestingly, we find that
   greater DVR penetration is beneficial for firms when the share of DVR
   owners in the population is above-rather than below-a threshold level.
   We also study the impact of different fast-forwarding ("zipping")
   behaviors on product market competition.

AB This paper investigates the effects of a limited consumer memory on the
   price competition between firms. It studies a specific aspect of
   memory-namely, the categorization of available price information that
   the consumers may need to recall for decision making. This paper
   analyzes competition between firms in a market with uninformed consumers
   who do not compare prices, informed consumers who compare prices but
   with limited memory, and informed consumers who have perfect memory.
   Consumers, aware of their memory limitations, choose how to encode the
   prices into categories, whereas firms take the limitations of consumers
   into account in choosing their pricing strategies. Two distinct types of
   categorization processes are investigated: (1) a symmetric one in which
   consumers compare only the labels of price categories from the competing
   firms and (2) an asymmetric one in which consumers compare the recalled
   price of one firm with the actual price of the other. We find that the
   equilibrium partition for the consumers calls for finer categorization
   toward the bottom of the price distribution. Thus consumers have a
   motivation to invest in greater memory resources in encoding lower
   prices to induce firms to charge more favorable prices. The interaction
   between the categorization strategies of the consumers and the price
   competition between the firms is such that small initial improvements in
   recall move the market outcomes quickly toward the case of perfect
   recall. Even with few memory categories, the expected price consumers
   pay and their surplus is close to the case of perfect recall. There is
   thus a suggestion in this model that market competition adjusts to the
   memory limitations of consumers.

AB This study attempts to answer a basic customer management dilemma facing
   firms: when should the firm use behavior-based pricing (BBP) to
   discriminate between its own and competitors' customers in a competitive
   market? If BBP is profitable, when should the firm offer a lower price
   to its own customers rather than to the competitor's customers? This
   analysis considers two features of customer behavior up to now ignored
   in BBP literature: heterogeneity in customer value and changing
   preference (i.e., customer preferences are correlated but not fixed over
   time). In a model where both consumers and competing firms are
   forward-looking, we identify conditions when it is optimal to reward the
   firm's own or competitor's customers and when BBP increases or decreases
   profits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify
   conditions in which (1) it is optimal to reward one's own customers
   under symmetric competition and (2) BBP can increase profits with fully
   strategic and forward-looking consumers.

AB This paper documents the existence and magnitude of contiguous
   word-of-mouth effects of signal quality of a video-on-demand (VOD)
   service on customer acquisition. We operationalize contiguous
   word-of-mouth effect based on geographic proximity and use behavioral
   data to quantify the effect.
   The signal quality for this VOD service is exogenously determined,
   objectively measured, and spatially uncorrelated. Furthermore, it is
   unobserved to the potential subscriber and is revealed postadoption. For
   a subscriber, the signal quality translates directly into the number of
   movies available for viewing, thus representing a part of the overall
   service quality. The combination of signal quality along with location
   and neighborhood information for each subscriber and potential
   subscriber allows us to resolve the typical challenges in measuring
   causal social network effects.
   We find that contiguous word of mouth affects about 8% of the
   subscribers with respect to their adoption behavior. However, this
   effect acts as a double-edged sword because it is asymmetric. We find
   that the effect of negative word of mouth arising from poor signal
   quality is more than twice as large as the effect of positive word of
   mouth arising from excellent signal quality. Besides contiguous word of
   mouth, we find that advertising and the retail environment also play a
   role in adoption.

AB Before the deregulation of digital subscriber line (DSL) services by the
   Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2005, phone companies were
   required to share their DSL bandwidth with independent DSL providers.
   Despite the large number of independent providers that entered the
   market, phone companies accounted for 95.3% of all DSL subscribers in
   2005. A common explanation for this is based on supply-side factors such
   as the costs faced by these providers to lease phone lines from phone
   companies, as well as the price discounts offered by phone companies. In
   this paper, we look for a demand-side explanation for this market
   outcome. Analyzing consumer choices in the broadband category alone
   would lead us to the conclusion that consumers have a much higher
   preference for their local phone providers-a finding at odds with
   service awards received by independent DSL providers. Thus we look for a
   demand-side explanation that is based on the demand not just for
   broadband services but also for related services such as cable TV and
   local phone. We find evidence of strong complementarities between the
   consumption of broadband and of those related categories. The main
   source of such complementarities, in our data, is the benefits to
   consumers from having a single provider for multiple services. We then
   carry out counterfactual experiments assuming that there are no changes
   in the regular prices of the various services. Our results indicate that
   the share of phone companies in the broadband market would have been 43%
   smaller without complementarities stemming from such a single-provider
   effect, whereas shutting off the state dependence effects would have
   reduced their share by 30%, and shutting off the effects of price
   discounts on the DSL+ local phone bundle would have resulted in their
   share declining by 21%.

AB Despite the economic significance of the theme park industry and the
   huge investments needed to set up new attractions, no marketing models
   exist to guide these investment decisions. This study addresses this gap
   in the literature by estimating a response model for theme park
   attendance. The model not only determines the contribution of each
   attraction to attendance, but also how this contribution is distributed
   within and across years. The model accommodates saturation effects,
   which imply that the impact of a new attraction is smaller if similar
   attractions are already present. It also captures reinforcement effects,
   meaning that a new attraction may reinforce the drawing power of similar
   extant attractions, especially when these were introduced recently. The
   model is calibrated on 25 years of weekly attendance data from the
   Efteling, a leading European theme park. Our return on investment
   calculations show that it is more profitable to invest in multiple
   smaller attractions than in one big one. This finding is in remarkable
   contrast with the current "arms race" in the industry. Furthermore, even
   though thrill rides tend to be more effective than theme rides, there
   are conditions under which one should consider to switch to the latter.

AB Private labels (PLs) are ubiquitous in several categories, including
   groceries, apparel, and appliances. However, existing empirical work has
   not examined the differential impact of various upstream supply
   arrangements for PL products or the strategic motives for PL supply. To
   do so requires one to model the interaction between private and national
   label (NL) products both upstream and downstream while accounting for
   strategic behavior on the part of manufacturers and retailers and
   retaining essential differences between NL and PL products. We build a
   model that satisfies these requirements and lets us answer our two
   research questions: First, can an NL firm profit from being an
   outsourced PL supplier? Second, what are the upstream and downstream
   impacts of different PL supply arrangements?
   We answer these questions by modeling private labels as homogenous
   products at wholesale, but as differentiated products at retail. In
   contrast, national label products are differentiated at both wholesale
   and retail levels. Using structural model estimates for fluid milk in a
   major metropolitan area, we conduct three counterfactual experiments. We
   find that both NL producers and retailers profit from adding private
   labels. We also find that a vertically integrated supply of PL leads to
   lower prices for end consumers.

AB Many firms increasingly offer community venues to their customers to
   facilitate social interactions amongst them. Prior studies have shown
   that community participants have high engagement and loyalty toward the
   firm and provide useful feedback and referrals. However, it is not clear
   whether community participants are the firm's "fans" to begin with and
   self-select themselves into the community, or whether community
   participation leads to increased relational customer behaviors. In the
   current research, we employ data from a field experiment to help answer
   this question. The data come from a year-long study conducted by eBay
   Germany, and they reveal that a simple e-mail invitation significantly
   increased customer participation in the firm's community. Results also
   show that community participation had mixed effects on customers'
   likelihoods of participating in buying and selling behaviors. Community
   participation did not translate into increased behaviors, as would be
   commonly expected. Although there is no impact of participation on the
   number of bids placed or the revenue earned, there is a negative impact
   of participation on the number of listings and the amount spent.
   Together, these results suggest that the community participants become
   more selective and efficient sellers, and they also become more
   conservative in their spending on the items for which they bid. The
   results also show that customer community marketing programs may be
   targeted to a broader set of the firm's customers than just the fans.

AB Health-care experts believe that increases in portion sizes served by
   food vendors contribute to the obesity epidemic. This paper shows that
   food vendors can profit handsomely by using supersizing strategies where
   regular portion sizes are priced sufficiently high to discourage
   price-conscious consumers from selecting them, and the prices for
   enlarging food portions are set so low that these customers are tempted
   to order the larger portion sizes and overeat. Setting aside the impact
   of obesity on health-care costs, we show that using supersizing to steer
   customers toward consuming excessive amounts of food can destroy value
   from a social perspective; thus this social value destruction trap adds
   another justification for pressuring food vendors to reduce supersizing
   for unhealthy food. As a public policy response, we consider how
   "moderating policies" may counter these effects through measures
   designed specifically to encourage eating in moderation by applying
   supersizing bans, taxes, and warnings.

   activity (the audiovisual representation of brands) and consumers'
   focused versus dispersed attention have on consumer moment-to-moment
   avoidance decisions during television advertising. We formalize this
   framework in a dynamic probit model and estimate it with Markov chain
   Monte Carlo methods. Data on avoidance through zapping, along with eye
   tracking on 31 commercials for nearly 2,000 participants, are used to
   calibrate the model. New, simple metrics of attention dispersion are
   shown to strongly predict avoidance. Independent of this, central
   on-screen brand positions, but not brand size, further promote
   commercial avoidance. Based on the model estimation, we optimize the
   branding activity that is under marketing control for ads in the sample
   to reduce commercial avoidance. This reveals that brand pulsing-while
   keeping total brand exposure constant-decreases commercial avoidance
   significantly. Both numerical simulations and a controlled experiment
   using regular and edited commercials, respectively, provide evidence of
   the benefits of brand pulsing to ward off commercial avoidance.
   Implications for advertising management and theory are addressed.

AB Two-sided exchange networks (such as eBay.com) often advertise their
   number of users, presumably to encourage further participation. However,
   these networks differ markedly on how they advertise their user base.
   Some highlight the number of sellers, some emphasize the number of
   buyers, and others disclose both. We use field experiment data from a
   business-to-business website to examine the efficacy of these different
   display formats. Before each potential seller posted a listing, the
   website randomized whether to display the number of buyers and/or
   sellers, and if so, how many buyers and/or sellers to claim. We find
   that when information about both buyers and sellers is displayed, a
   large number of sellers deters further seller listings. However, this
   deterrence effect disappears when only the number of sellers is
   presented. Similarly, a large number of buyers is more likely to attract
   new listings when it is displayed together with the number of sellers.
   These results suggest the presence of indirect network externalities,
   whereby a seller prefers markets with many other sellers because they
   help attract more buyers.

AB Can negative information about a product increase sales, and if so,
   when? Although popular wisdom suggests that "any publicity is good
   publicity," prior research has demonstrated only downsides to negative
   press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example, have been found
   to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a combination of econometric
   analysis and experimental methods, we unify these perspectives to
   delineate contexts under which negative publicity about a product will
   have positive versus negative effects. Specifically, we argue that
   negative publicity can increase purchase likelihood and sales by
   increasing product awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should
   have differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three
   studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the New
   York Times hurt sales of books by well-known authors, for example, it
   increased sales of books that had lower prior awareness. The studies
   further underscore the importance of a gap between publicity and
   purchase occasion and the mediating role of increased awareness in these
   effects.

AB Whereas a growing body of research has examined the consumer-related
   implications of deceptive advertising, the stock market consequences
   stemming from the regulatory exposure of such infractions remain largely
   unexplored. In a step to address this gap, the current research examines
   the effect of regulatory reports of misleading ads on firm stock prices.
   Results from an event study, focusing on the pharmaceutical industry as
   the empirical context, show an average abnormal return of -0.91%
   associated with regulatory reports of deceptive advertising. Analysis of
   the abnormal returns, however, reveals that the stock market response to
   these reports is shaped by omission bias, in that investors penalize
   commission violations more than omission violations. Furthermore, firm
   reputation is found to moderate the penalty for commission violations.
   In addition, two experiments examine the effect of such violations on
   investor beliefs. The first helps elucidate the process mechanism
   underlying the observed stock market effects and the second provides
   insights regarding the reputation-omission bias interaction for firms
   committing repeat violations. Overall, our findings provide important
   theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications regarding the
   role of financial markets in regulating deceptive ad practices.

AB The pioneering Pasternack returns-policy model analyzed channel
   coordination with a single supplier catering to a retailer facing
   stochastic demand for a perishable product with a fixed price, and the
   model showed that giving partial returns of unsold stock to the retailer
   is the optimal policy for the entire supply chain. The result thus begs
   the question as to why manufacturers of perishable commodities widely
   accept full returns of unsold stock as the norm. We model the
   environment as one where two capacity-constrained manufacturers compete
   for shelf space with the same retailer, and we show that a
   complete-credit returns policy is in fact the only possible equilibrium
   of the game. Our results obviate the need for knowing the exact
   functional form of the demand distribution in order to compute the
   returns credit, as Pasternack's results would require. From a retailer's
   standpoint, we establish a simple procurement strategy and show that it
   is optimal. The same game with price-only contracting has a
   pure-strategy equilibrium when the supplier capacities are below a
   threshold value and a mixed-strategy equilibrium when the supplier
   capacities cross this threshold but are still so limited that no single
   supplier can with certainty supply all the quantity demanded.

AB This paper examines pairwise assortment similarities at U. S.
   supermarkets to understand how assortment composition and size are
   related to underlying factors that describe local store clientele, local
   competitive structure, and the retail outlets' characteristics. The
   top-selling items, which cumulatively make up 50% of sales, are sold at
   nearly every store, but other items are viewed as optional. We find
   that, within states, supermarkets owned by the same chain carry similar
   assortments and that the composition of their clientele and the presence
   of competing stores have effects on assortment similarity that are an
   order of magnitude smaller than ownership structure. In contrast, we
   find that, across states, supermarkets owned by the same chain do
   version their assortment. We explain this difference using extant work
   on the minimal efficient scale of supermarkets and on local demand
   effects. Furthermore, we investigate the distribution and role of
   regional brands. We find that regional brands are primarily distributed
   by small regional chains or independent stores. "Value" regional brands
   are primarily distributed by supermarket firms without store brands,
   whereas the distribution of "premium" regional brands is unrelated to
   the presence of store brands. We discuss our findings in the context of
   modeling assortment decisions and manufacturers designing distribution
   policies.

AB Market segmentation is inherently a multicriterion problem even though
   it has often been modeled as a single-criterion problem in the
   traditional marketing literature and in practice. This paper discusses
   the multicriterion nature of market segmentation and develops a new
   mathematical model that addresses this issue. A new method for market
   segmentation based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithms, called
   MMSEA, is developed. It complements existing segmentation methods by
   optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, searching for globally
   optimal solutions, and approximating a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.
   We have applied and evaluated this method in two empirical studies for
   two firms from distinct industries: descriptive segmentation of the cell
   phone service market from a dual-value creation perspective and
   predictive segmentation of retail customers based on profit and customer
   sociodemographic attributes. The results provide decision makers with
   compelling alternatives and enhanced flexibility currently missing in
   existing market segmentation methods.

AB The ability to demonstrate the impact of marketing action on firm
   financial performance is crucial for evaluating, justifying, and
   optimizing the expenditure of a firm's marketing resources. This
   presents itself as a formidable task when one considers both the variety
   and potential influence of marketing activity. We propose a hierarchical
   Bayesian model of simultaneous supply and demand that allows us to
   formally study the financial impact of a variety of marketing
   activities, including those that operate on different timescales. The
   supply-side model provides insight into how the firm allocates resources
   across its various subunits. We illustrate our approach in a services
   context by integrating data from three independent studies conducted by
   a large national bank. Our model allows customer and employee
   satisfaction to influence firm profitability by moderating the
   conditional relationship between the bank's operational inputs and its
   proclivity to produce revenue.

AB The U. S. pharmaceutical industry spent upwards of $18 billion on
   marketing drugs in 2005; detailing and drug sampling activities
   accounted for the bulk of this spending. To stay competitive,
   pharmaceutical managers need to maximize the return on these marketing
   investments by determining which physicians to target as well as when
   and how to target them.
   In this paper, we present a two-stage approach for dynamically
   allocating detailing and sampling activities across physicians to
   maximize long-run profitability. In the first stage, we estimate a
   hierarchical Bayesian, nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model to assess the
   short-and long-term effects of pharmaceutical marketing activities. The
   model captures physicians' heterogeneity and dynamics in prescription
   behavior. In the second stage, we formulate a partially observable
   Markov decision process that integrates over the posterior distribution
   of the hidden Markov model parameters to derive a dynamic marketing
   resource allocation policy across physicians.
   We apply the proposed approach in the context of a new drug introduction
   by a major pharmaceutical firm. We identify three prescription-behavior
   states, a high degree of physicians' dynamics, and substantial long-term
   effects for detailing and sampling. We find that detailing is most
   effective as an acquisition tool, whereas sampling is most effective as
   a retention tool. The optimization results suggest that the firm could
   increase its profits substantially while decreasing its marketing
   spending. Our suggested framework provides important implications for
   dynamically managing customers and maximizing long-run profitability.

AB This paper explores whether and how a firm should adapt its strategy in
   view of consumer use of prior customer ratings. Specifically, we
   consider optimal pricing and whether the firm should offer an unexpected
   frill to early customers to enhance their product experiences. We show
   that if price history is unobserved by consumers, a forward-looking firm
   should always modify its strategy from single-period optimal one, but it
   may be optimal to do so by lowering price, by lowering price and
   offering frills, or by raising price and offering frills, depending on
   the market growth rate. Specifically, the last strategy becomes optimal
   when market growth rate is high enough. The results are similar when the
   price history is observed by consumers, except that no deviation from
   single-period profit maximization choices is optimal when market growth
   is low enough. We also analyze whether the firm should prefer that the
   price information be stated in or left out of consumer reviews. In
   addition, in considering the effects of consumer heterogeneity, we
   conclude that the optimal firm's effort to affect ratings is higher when
   the idiosyncratic part of consumer uncertainty is larger.

AB Our objective in this paper is to measure the impact (valence, volume,
   and variance) of national online user reviews on designated market area
   (DMA)-level local geographic box office performance of movies. We
   account for three complications with analyses that use national-level
   aggregate box office data: (i) aggregation across heterogeneous markets
   (spatial aggregation), (ii) serial correlation as a result of sequential
   release of movies (endogenous rollout), and (iii) serial correlation as
   a result of other unobserved components that could affect inferences
   regarding the impact of user reviews. We use daily box office ticket
   sales data for 148 movies released in the United States during a
   16-month period (out of the 874 movies released) along with user review
   data from the Yahoo! Movies website. The analysis also controls for
   other possible box office drivers. Our identification strategy rests on
   our ability to identify plausible instruments for user ratings by
   exploiting the sequential release of movies across markets-because user
   reviews can only come from markets where the movie has previously been
   released, exogenous variables from previous markets would be appropriate
   instruments in subsequent markets.
   In contrast with previous studies that have found that the main driver
   of box office performance is the volume of reviews, we find that it is
   the valence that seems to matter and not the volume. Furthermore,
   ignoring the endogenous rollout decision does not seem to have a big
   impact on the results from our DMA-level analysis. When we carry out our
   analysis with aggregated national data, we obtain the same results as
   those from previous studies, i.e., that volume matters but not the
   valence. Using various market-level controls in the national data model,
   we attempt to identify the source of this difference.
   By conducting our empirical analysis at the DMA level and accounting for
   prerelease advertising, we can classify DMAs based on their
   responsiveness to firm-initiated marketing effort (advertising) and
   consumer-generated marketing (online word of mouth). A unique feature of
   our study is that it allows marketing managers to assess a DMA's
   responsiveness along these two dimensions. The substantive insights can
   help studios and distributors evaluate their future product rollout
   strategies. Although our empirical analysis is conducted using motion
   picture industry data, our approach to addressing the endogeneity of
   reviews is generalizable to other industry settings where products are
   sequentially rolled out.

AB This paper presents five empirical tests of the popular modeling
   abstraction that assumes bids from online auctions with proxy bidding
   can be analyzed "as if" they were bids from a second-price sealed-bid
   auction. The tests rely on observations of the magnitudes and timings of
   the top two proxy bids, with the different tests stemming from different
   regularity assumptions about the underlying distribution of valuation
   signals. We apply the tests to data from three eBay markets-MP3 players,
   DVDs, and used cars-and we reject the sealed-bid abstraction in all
   three data sets. A closer examination of these rejections suggests that
   they are driven by less experienced bidders. This consistent rejection
   casts doubt on several existing theories of online auction behavior and
   suggests some demand estimates based on the abstraction can be biased.
   To assess the direction and magnitude of this bias, we propose and
   estimate a new model in which some bidders conform to the abstraction
   while other bidders bid in a reactive fashion. Because reactive bidding
   can be at least partially detected from the data, we are able to
   estimate the underlying distribution of demand and compare it to what
   the sealed-bid abstraction implies. We find that our proposed model fits
   the data better, and our demand estimates reveal a large potential
   downward bias were we to assume the second-price sealed-bid model
   instead.

   the joint distribution of the top two proxy bids of an auction,
   Zeithammer and Adams show that inexperienced bidders' reactive bidding
   is the main cause of the rejection of the sealed-bid abstraction. Their
   empirical study suggests that a large percentage of bidders reactively
   bid, and there is weak evolutionary pressure for bidders to converge to
   sealed bidding. We discuss theoretical implications of this rejection
   and the role of bidder experience, as well as inferences about bidder
   learning. Tracking an inexperienced bidder's bidding behavior over time,
   we show that bidders learn and their bidding strategy gravitates toward
   rational bidding. Potential biases in bidder experience measurement and
   bidder learning can be assessed using a cross-sectional, time-series
   data set that tracks a random sample of new eBay bidders. Learning speed
   is faster with their complete bidding history rather than feedback
   ratings or winning observations only. We highlight the importance of
   proper measures of bidder experience and its effect on bidding strategy
   evolutions, both of which play important roles in clarifying bidding
   behavior in online auctions.

   2010. The sealed-bid abstraction in online auctions. Marketing Sci.
   29(6) 964-987] successfully documents consistent patterns in eBay
   bidding data that cast doubt on the common assumption that bidders in
   such auctions follow a "bid = value" strategy. These anomalies lend
   support to the authors' alternative model in which some bidders bid
   reactively and consequently bid below their valuation most of the time.
   The consistency of the authors' findings as well as the ability of their
   alternative explanation to account for all of their test results lends
   great support to their thesis. However, we think that several of their
   empirical tests examine ancillary assumptions about bidder behavior and
   do not test the bid = value assumption directly. Furthermore, although
   their reduced-form model incorporating "reactive" bidders is a good
   first attempt at expanding the canonical framework, we worry that their
   counterfactual pricing analysis using the reactive model is suspect
   because the parameters they estimate are not structural. Overall, the
   Zeithammer and Adams paper is a carefully argued critique of empirical
   methods used to study online auctions and provides valuable ideas to
   improve on these methods.

AB Using aggregate product search data from Amazon.com, we jointly estimate
   consumer information search and online demand for consumer durable
   goods. To estimate the demand and search primitives, we introduce an
   optimal sequential search process into a model of choice and treat the
   observed market-level product search data as aggregations of
   individual-level optimal search sequences. The model builds on the
   dynamic programming framework by Weitzman [Weitzman, M. L. 1979. Optimal
   search for the best alternative. Econometrica 47(3) 641-654] and
   combines it with a choice model. It can accommodate highly complex
   demand patterns at the market level. At the individual level, the model
   has a number of attractive properties in estimation, including
   closed-form expressions for the probability distribution of alternative
   sets of searched goods and breaking the curse of dimensionality. Using
   numerical experiments, we verify the model's ability to identify the
   heterogeneous consumer tastes and search costs from product search data.
   Empirically, the model is applied to the online market for camcorders
   and is used to answer manufacturer questions about market structure and
   competition and to address policy-maker issues about the effect of
   selectively lowered search costs on consumer surplus outcomes. We
   demonstrate that the demand estimates from our search model predict the
   actual product sales ranks. We find that consumer search for camcorders
   at Amazon.com is typically limited to 10-15 choice options and that this
   affects estimates of own and cross elasticities. In a policy simulation,
   we also find that the vast majority of the households benefit from
   Amazon.com's product recommendations via lower search costs.

AB To evaluate the success of a new product, managers need to determine how
   much of its new demand is due to cannibalizing the firm's other
   products, rather than drawing from competition or generating primary
   demand. We introduce a time-varying vector error-correction model to
   decompose the base sales of a new product into its constituent sources.
   The model allows managers to estimate cannibalization effects and
   calculate the new product's net demand, which may be considerably less
   than its total demand. We apply our methodology to the introduction of
   the Lexus RX300 using detailed car transaction data. This case is
   especially interesting because the Lexus RX300 was the first crossover
   sport utility vehicle (SUV), implying that its demand could come from
   both the luxury SUV and the luxury sedan categories. Because Lexus was
   active in both categories, there was a double cannibalization potential.
   We show how the contribution of the different demand sources varies over
   time and discuss the managerial implications for both the focal brand
   and its competitors.

AB Reverse pricing is a market mechanism under which a consumer's bid for a
   product leads to a sale if the bid exceeds a hidden acceptance threshold
   the seller has set in advance. The seller faces two key decisions in
   designing such a mechanism. First, he must decide where in the process
   to collect the revenue-that is, whether to commit to a minimum markup
   above cost (and thus define the bid-acceptance threshold given cost) and
   whether to set a fee for the consumer's right to bid. Second, the seller
   must decide whether to facilitate or hinder consumer learning about the
   current bid-acceptance threshold. We analyze these decisions for a
   profit-maximizing small intermediary retailer selling to consumers who
   can also purchase the product in an outside posted-price market. The
   optimal revenue model is to charge a fee for the right to bid and then
   accept all bids above cost, rather than to set a positive minimum markup
   above cost. Avoiding minimum markups in favor of a bidding fee is more
   profitable because of increased efficiency arising from more entry by
   consumers and higher bids by the entrants. When consumers learn about
   the bid-acceptance threshold before they enter the market, efficiency
   increases further, and generating revenue through a bidding fee can
   compensate the seller for his loss of information rent when the
   competition from the outside posted-price firm is relatively weak.

AB Consumers often return a product to a retailer because they learn after
   purchase that the product does not match as well with preferences as had
   been expected. This is a costly issue for retailers and manufacturers-in
   fact, it is estimated that the U.S. electronics industry alone spent
   $13.8 billion dollars in 2007 to restock returned products [Lawton, C.
   2008. The war on returns. Wall Street Journal (May 8) D1]. The bulk of
   these returns were nondefective items that simply were not what the
   consumer wanted. To eliminate returns and to recoup the cost of handling
   returns, many retailers are adopting the practice of charging restocking
   fees to consumers as a penalty for making returns. This paper employs an
   analytical model of a bilateral monopoly to examine the impact of
   reverse channel structure on the equilibrium return policy and profit.
   More specifically, we examine how the return penalty is affected by
   whether returns are salvaged by the manufacturer or by the retailer.
   Interestingly, we find that the return penalty may be more severe when
   returns are salvaged by a channel member who derives greater value from
   a returned unit. Also, the manufacturer may earn greater profit by
   accepting returns even if the retailer has a more efficient outlet for
   salvaging units.

AB Many businesses track repeat transactions on a discrete-time basis.
   These include (1) companies for whom transactions can only occur at
   fixed regular intervals, (2) firms that frequently associate
   transactions with specific events (e. g., a charity that records whether
   supporters respond to a particular appeal), and (3) organizations that
   choose to utilize discrete reporting periods even though the
   transactions can occur at any time. Furthermore, many of these
   businesses operate in a noncontractual setting, so they have a difficult
   time differentiating between those customers who have ended their
   relationship with the firm versus those who are in the midst of a long
   hiatus between transactions. We develop a model to predict future
   purchasing patterns for a customer base that can be described by these
   structural characteristics. Our beta-geometric/beta-Bernoulli (BG/BB)
   model captures both of the underlying behavioral processes (i.e.,
   customers' purchasing while "alive" and time until each customer
   permanently "dies"). The model is easy to implement in a standard
   spreadsheet environment and yields relatively simple closed-form
   expressions for the expected number of future transactions conditional
   on past observed behavior (and other quantities of managerial interest).
   We apply this discrete-time analog of the well-known Pareto/NBD model to
   a data set on donations made by the supporters of a nonprofit
   organization located in the midwestern United States. Our analysis
   demonstrates the excellent ability of the BG/BB model to describe and
   predict the future behavior of a customer base.

AB In this research, we examine a novel mechanism of interorganizational
   relationship dissolution: incoherence in a partner's behavior. We
   propose that the discrepancy between an exchange partner's opportunistic
   behavior and the focal firm's expectations may create a state of
   incoherence and uncertainty and that this effect can be damaging to the
   exchange even when the partner's behavior is better than expected. Using
   nearly 500 longitudinal, confidential reports of industrial buyers and
   sellers, we find supportive evidence that (1) the net effect of the
   discrepancy is initially positive when behavior is better than expected
   but becomes rapidly negative thereafter, and (2) the net effect of the
   discrepancy is always negative when behavior is worse than expected.
   Thus, these effects will generally damage the exchange even as the
   partner tries to improve the relationship. This gives insight into why
   exchange relationships that hit a downward spiral can be difficult, if
   not impossible, to salvage. We also show that the dysfunctional
   consequences of discrepancy are mitigated through exchange structures
   such as the magnitude of dependence on an organizational partner, the
   development phase of the relationship, and the presence of bilateral
   idiosyncratic investments. Implications for theory and the management of
   interorganizational relationships are developed.

AB This paper looks into the effects of information transparency on market
   participants in an online trading environment. We study these effects in
   business-to-business electronic markets with firms competing in both
   upstream and downstream industries. The prior literature generally
   assumes that either the downstream firm (buyer) or the upstream firm
   (seller) is a monopoly. It is not clear whether information transparency
   would still create value if both buyers and sellers face oligopolistic
   competition, where the benefits of information transparency could be
   competed away. To answer this question, we first develop a simple
   two-echelon e-market model and then extend the model to more general
   settings. We find that information transparency can create value for the
   overall e-market, yet it affects buyers and sellers very differently:
   one side will be hurt, depending on the competition mode (Cournot or
   Bertrand) in the downstream. This suggests that a manufacturer-owned, a
   supplier-owned, and a neutral e-market will have different preferences
   for information transparency. Finally, we find that information
   transparency can hurt consumers when the downstream industry engages in
   Bertrand competition. This is a surprising result given the expectation
   that online markets create substantial value for consumers.

AB The availability of digital channels for media distribution has raised
   many important questions for marketers, notably, whether digital
   distribution channels will cannibalize physical sales and whether
   legitimate digital distribution channels will dissuade consumers from
   using (illegitimate) digital piracy channels. We address these two
   questions using the removal of NBC content from Apple's iTunes store in
   December 2007, and its restoration in September 2008, as natural shocks
   to the supply of legitimate digital content, and we analyze the impact
   of this shock on demand through BitTorrent piracy channels and the
   Amazon.com DVD store.
   To do this we collected two large data sets from Mininova.com and
   Amazon.com, documenting levels of piracy and DVD sales for both NBC and
   other major networks' content around these events. We analyze these data
   in a difference-in-difference model and find that NBC's decision to
   remove its content from iTunes in December 2007 is causally associated
   with an 11.4% increase in the demand for NBC's pirated content. This is
   roughly equivalent to an increase of 48,000 downloads a day for NBC's
   content and is approximately twice as large as the total legal purchases
   on iTunes for the same content in the period preceding the removal. We
   also find evidence of a smaller, and statistically insignificant,
   decrease in piracy for the same content when it was restored to the
   iTunes store in September 2008. Finally, we see no change in demand for
   NBC's DVD content at Amazon.com associated with NBC's closing or
   reopening of its digital distribution channel on iTunes.

AB Price dispersion in simultaneous online auctions is a puzzle in light of
   the relatively low search costs required to find the lower price. Much
   of this price dispersion appears to be due to a lack of switching by
   bidders between auctions, which in turn could be due to inertia related
   to search costs. We identify some of the influencing factors through a
   controlled field experiment involving pairs of simultaneous auctions.
   Keeping the sellers and the goods sold identical between two auctions,
   we vary auction design features between and within pairs including
   shipping cost, open reserve, secret reserve price, and duration, and we
   provide bidders with incentives to search. We use a choice model that
   examines individual choice between pairs of simultaneous auctions. We
   find that within-pair price dispersion is substantial and that prices
   and auction choice by bidders are indeed related to search costs. We
   find strong inertia in auction choice and find that this effect
   significantly interacts with time left in the auction. Although
   individuals do not always choose a lower-priced auction, they are more
   likely to do so when search costs are low or search incentives are high.

AB Although advance selling and probabilistic selling differ in both
   motivation and implementation, we argue that they share a common
   characteristic-both offer consumers a choice involving buyer
   uncertainty. We develop a formal model to examine the general economics
   of purchase options that involve buyer uncertainty, explore the
   differences in buyer uncertainty created via these two strategies, and
   derive conditions under which one dominates the other. We show that the
   seller can address unobservable buyer heterogeneity by inducing sales
   involving buyer uncertainty via two different mechanisms: (1)
   homogenizing heterogeneous consumers and (2) separating heterogeneous
   consumers. Offering advance sales encourages customers to purchase while
   they are uncertain about their consumption states (more homogeneous),
   but offering probabilistic goods encourages customers to reveal their
   heterogeneity via self-selecting whether or not to purchase the
   uncertain product. The relative attractiveness of these two selling
   strategies depends on the degree of two types of buyer heterogeneity:
   (1) Max_Value-Heterogeneity, which is the variation in consumers'
   valuations for their preferred good, and (2) Strength-Heterogeneity,
   which is the variation in the strength of consumers' preferences.
   Neither strategy is advantageous unless the market exhibits sufficient
   Max_Value-Heterogeneity. However, whereas Strength-Heterogeneity can
   destroy the profit advantage of advance selling, a mid-range of
   Strength-Heterogeneity is necessary for probabilistic selling to be
   advantageous.

AB In this research we introduce a new class of multivariate probability
   models to the marketing literature. Known as "copula models," they have
   a number of attractive features. First, they permit the combination of
   any univariate marginal distributions that need not come from the same
   distributional family. Second, a particular class of copula models,
   called "elliptical copula," has the property that they increase in
   complexity at a much slower rate than existing multivariate probability
   models as the number of dimensions increase. Third, they are very
   general, encompassing a number of existing multivariate models and
   providing a framework for generating many more. These advantages give
   copula models a greater potential for use in empirical analysis than
   existing probability models used in marketing. We exploit and extend
   recent developments in Bayesian estimation to propose an approach that
   allows reliable estimation of elliptical copula models in high
   dimensions. Rather than focusing on a single marketing problem, we
   demonstrate the versatility and accuracy of copula models with four
   examples to show the flexibility of the method. In every case, the
   copula model either handles a situation that could not be modeled
   previously or gives improved accuracy compared with prior models.

AB Brand preferences and marketplace demand are a reflection of the
   importance of underlying needs of consumers and the efficacy of product
   attributes for delivering value. Dog owners, for example, may look to
   dog foods to provide specific benefits for their pets (e. g., shiny
   coats) that may not be available from current offerings. An analysis of
   consumer wants for these consumers would reveal weak demand for product
   attributes resulting from low efficacy, despite the presence of strong
   latent interest. The challenge in identifying such unmet demand is in
   distinguishing it from other reasons for weak preference, such as
   general noninterest in the category and heterogeneous tastes. We propose
   a model for separating out these effects within the context of conjoint

AB The use of a durable good is limited by both its physical life and

   years (physical life) or 100,000 miles (usable life), whichever comes
   first. We propose a framework for examining how a profit-maximizing firm
   might choose the usable life, physical life, and selling price of a
   durable good. The proposed framework considers differences in usage
   rates and product valuations by consumers and allows for the effects of
   technological constraints and product obsolescence on a product's usable
   and physical lives. Our main result characterizes a relationship between
   optimal price, cost elasticities, and opportunity costs associated with
   relaxing upper bounds on usable and physical lives. We describe
   conditions under which either usable life or physical life, or both,

   effort to relaxing nonbinding constraints on usable life or physical
   life; consider when price cuts might be accompanied with product

AB The idea of hierarchical, sequential, or intermediate effects has long
   been posited in textbooks and academic literature. Hierarchical effects
   occur when relationships among variables are mediated through other
   variables. Challenges in studying hierarchical effects in marketing
   include the large number of items present in most commercial studies and
   the presence of heterogeneous relationships among the variables.
   Existing approaches have dealt with the large number of variables by
   employing a factor structure representation of the data and have used
   standard mixture distributions for representing different response
   segments. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model for the analysis of
   hierarchical data using the actual response items and incorporating
   heterogeneity that better reflects consumer stages in a decision
   process. Cross-sectional data from a national brand-tracking study are
   used to illustrate our model, where we find empirical support for a
   hierarchical relationship among media recall, brand beliefs, and
   intended actions. We find these effects to be insignificant when
   measured with standard models and aggregate analyses. The proposed model
   is useful for understanding the influence of variables that lead to
   intermediate as opposed to direct effects on brand choice.

   S. 1998. Mail versus mall: A strategic analysis of competition between
   direct marketers and conventional retailers. Marketing Sci. 17(3)
   181-195], our game-theoretic model captures the fundamental difference
   between two different channel types and consumer heterogeneity in
   preference for the Internet channel use. The equilibrium solutions
   indicate that Internet channel entry does not always lead to lower
   retail prices and enhanced consumer welfare. We also find that an
   independent retailer might become worse off after adding its own
   Internet outlet under certain market conditions. We find that the impact
   of the Internet channel introduction substantially varies across channel
   structures and market environments. We explain these varied results by
   proposing a framework of five key strategic forces that shape the
   overall impact of the Internet channel introduction.

AB Firms in several markets attract consumers by offering discounts in
   other unrelated markets. This promotion strategy, which we call
   "cross-market discounts," has been successfully adopted in the last few
   years by many grocery retailers in partnership with gasoline retailers
   across North America, Europe, and Australia. In this paper, we use an
   analytical model to investigate the major forces driving the
   profitability of this novel promotion strategy. We consider a
   generalized scenario in which purchases in a source market lead to price
   discounts redeemable in a target market. Our analysis shows that this
   strategy can be a revenue driver by simultaneously increasing prices as
   well as sales in the source market, even though we assume the demand
   curve to be downward sloping in price. Moreover, it distributes
   additional consumption (motivated by the discount) in two markets, and
   under diminishing marginal returns from consumption, this can
   simultaneously increase firm profits and consumer welfare more
   effectively than traditional nonlinear pricing strategies. Our study
   provides many other interesting insights as well, and our key results
   are in accordance with anecdotal evidence obtained from managers and
   industry publications.

AB Behavior-based personalization" has gained popularity in recent years,
   whereby businesses offer personalized products based on consumers'
   purchase histories. This paper highlights two perils of behavior-based
   personalization in competitive markets. First, although purchase
   histories reveal consumer preferences, competitive exploitation of such
   information damages differentiation, similar to the classic finding that
   behavior-based price discrimination intensifies price competition. With
   endogenous product design, there is yet a second peril. It emerges when
   forward-looking firms try to avoid the first peril by suppressing the
   information value of purchase histories. Ideally, if a market leader
   serves all consumers on day 1, purchase histories contain no information
   about consumer preferences. However, knowing that their rivals are
   willing to accommodate a market leader, firms are more likely to offer a
   mainstream design at day 1, which jeopardizes differentiation. Based on
   this understanding, I investigate how the perils of behavior-based
   personalization change under alternative market conditions, such as
   firms' better knowledge about their own customers, consumer loyalty and
   inertia, consumer self-selection, and the need for classic designs.

AB The Internet has increased the flexibility of retailers, allowing them
   to operate an online arm in addition to their physical stores. The
   online channel offers potential benefits in selling to customer segments
   that value the convenience of online shopping, but it also raises new
   challenges. These include the higher likelihood of costly product
   returns when customers' ability to "touch and feel" products is
   important in determining fit. We study competing retailers that can
   operate dual channels ("bricks and clicks") and examine how pricing
   strategies and physical store assistance levels change as a result of
   the additional Internet outlet. A central result we obtain is that when
   differentiation among competing retailers is not too high, having an
   online channel can actually increase investment in store assistance
   levels (e. g., greater shelf display, more-qualified sales staff, floor
   samples) and decrease profits. Consequently, when the decision to open
   an Internet channel is endogenized, there can exist an asymmetric
   equilibrium where only one retailer elects to operate an online arm but
   earns lower profits than its bricks-only rival. We also characterize
   equilibria where firms open an online channel, even though consumers
   only use it for research and learning purposes but buy in stores. A
   number of extensions are discussed, including retail settings where
   firms carry multiple product categories, shipping and handling costs,
   and the role of store assistance in impacting consumer perceived
   benefits.

AB Are brands the "new religion"? Practitioners and scholars have been
   intrigued by the possibility, but strong theory and empirical evidence
   supporting the existence of a relationship between brands and religion
   is scarce. In what follows, we argue and demonstrate that religiosity is
   indeed related to "brand reliance," i.e., the degree to which consumers
   prefer branded goods over unbranded goods or goods without a well-known
   national brand.
   We theorize that brands and religiosity may serve as substitutes for one
   another because both allow individuals to express their feelings of
   self-worth. We provide support for this substitution hypothesis with U.
   S. state-level data (field study) as well as individual-level data where
   religiosity is experimentally primed (study 1) or measured as a chronic
   individual difference (study 2). Importantly, studies 1 and 2
   demonstrate that the relationship between religiosity and brand reliance
   only exists in product categories in which brands enable consumers to
   express themselves (e. g., clothes). Moreover, studies 3 and 4
   demonstrate that the expression of self-worth is an important factor
   underlying the negative relationship.

AB In certain categories, an important element of competition is the use of
   previews to signal information to potential consumers about product
   attributes. For example, the front page of a newspaper provides a
   preview to potential newspaper buyers before they purchase the product.
   In this context, a news provider can provide previews that are highly
   informative about the content of the news product. Conversely, a news
   provider can utilize a preview that is relatively uninformative. We
   examine the incentives that firms have to adopt different preview
   strategies in a context where they do not have complete control of
   product positioning. Our analysis shows that preview strategy can be a
   useful source of differentiation. However, when a firm adopts a strategy
   of providing informative previews, it confers a positive externality on
   a competitor that utilizes uninformative previews. This reinforces the
   incentive of the competitor to use uninformative previews and explains
   why the market landscape in news provision is often characterized by
   asymmetric competition.

AB W e present a dynamic factor-analytic choice model to capture evolution
   of brand positions in latent attribute space. Our dynamic model allows
   researchers to investigate brand positioning in new categories or mature
   categories affected by structural change such as entry. We argue that
   even for mature categories not affected by structural change, the
   assumption of stable attributes may be untenable. We allow for evolution
   in attributes by modeling individual-level time-specific attributes as
   arising from dynamic means. The dynamic attribute means are modeled as a
   Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM). The DLM is nested within a
   factor-analytic choice model. Our approach makes efficient use of the
   data by leveraging estimates from previous and future periods to
   estimate current period attributes. We demonstrate the robustness of our
   model with data that simulate a variety of dynamic scenarios, including
   stationary behavior. We show that misspecified attribute dynamics induce
   temporal heteroskedasticty and correlation between the preference
   weights and the error term. Applying the model to a panel data set on
   household purchases in the malt beverage category, we find considerable
   evidence for dynamics in the latent brand attributes. From a managerial
   perspective, we find advertising expenditures help explain variation in
   the dynamic attribute means.

   applying standard hazard models to right-truncated data, i.e., data from

   positive duration dependence and hence can trick researchers into
   believing to have found evidence of social contagion when there is none.
   Truncation also tends to deflate the effect of time-invariant
   covariates. These results imply that not accounting for right truncation
   can lead managers to rely too much on word of mouth in generating new
   product adoption and to poorly identify the customers most likely to
   adopt early. Not accounting for right truncation can also lead to
   suboptimal pricing decisions and to erroneous assessments of variations
   in customer lifetime value. We assess the effectiveness of four possible

   corrected likelihood function protects one against truncation artifacts
   inflating coefficients of contagion and attenuating coefficients of

   Rational expectations require the publisher to consider past bid types

   conditional on setting rational expectations, publishers should consider
   offering multiple bid types to advertisers. For a special case of the

AB Experimental and survey-based research suggests that consumers often
   rely on their intuition and cognitive shortcuts to make decisions.
   Intuition and cognitive shortcuts can lead to suboptimal decisions and,
   especially in high-stakes decisions, to legitimate welfare concerns. In
   this paper, we propose an extension of a Bayesian learning model that
   allows us to quantify the impact of salience-the fact that some pieces
   of information are easier to retrieve from memory than others-on
   physician learning. We show, using data on actual prescriptions for real
   patients, that physicians' belief formation is strongly influenced by
   salience effects. Feedback from switching patients-the ones the
   physician decided to switch to a clinically equivalent
   treatment-receives considerably more weight than feedback from other
   patients. In the category we study, salience effects slowed down
   physicians' speed of learning and the adoption of a new treatment, which
   raises welfare concerns. For managers, our findings suggest that firms
   that are able to eliminate, or at least reduce, salience effects to a
   greater extent than their competitors can speed up the adoption of new
   treatments. We explore the implications of these results and suggest
   alternative applications of our model that are relevant for policy
   makers and managers.

AB Existing research on choice designs focuses exclusively on compensatory
   models that assume that all available alternatives are considered in the
   choice process. In this paper, we develop a method to construct
   efficient designs for a two-stage, consider-then-choose model that
   involves a noncompensatory screening process at the first stage and a
   compensatory choice process at the second stage. The method applies to
   both conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. Under certain
   conditions, the method also applies to the subset conjunctive and
   disjunctions of conjunctions screening rules. Based on the local design
   criterion, we conduct a comparative study of compensatory and
   conjunctive designs-the former are optimized for a compensatory model
   and the latter for a two-stage model that uses conjunctive screening in
   its first stage. We find that conjunctive designs have higher level
   overlap than compensatory designs. This occurs because level overlap
   helps pinpoint screening behavior. Higher overlap of conjunctive designs
   is also accompanied by lower orthogonality, less level balance, and more
   utility balance. We find that compensatory designs have a significant
   loss of design efficiency when the true model involves conjunctive
   screening at the consideration stage. These designs also have much less
   power than conjunctive designs in identifying a true
   consider-then-choose process with conjunctive screening. In contrast,
   when the true model is compensatory, the efficiency loss from using a
   conjunctive design is lower. Also, conjunctive designs have about the
   same power as compensatory designs in identifying a true compensatory
   choice process. Our findings make a strong case for the use of
   conjunctive designs when there is prior evidence to support respondent
   screening.

AB T he failure of firms in the face of technological change has been a
   topic of intense research and debate, spawning the theory (among others)
   of disruptive technologies. However, the theory suffers from circular
   definitions, inadequate empirical evidence, and lack of a predictive
   model. We develop a new schema to address these limitations. The schema
   generates seven hypotheses and a testable model relating to platform
   technologies. We test this model and hypotheses with data on 36
   technologies from seven markets. Contrary to extant theory, technologies
   that adopt a lower attack ("potentially disruptive technologies") (1)
   are introduced as frequently by incumbents as by entrants, (2) are not
   cheaper than older technologies, and (3) rarely disrupt firms; and (4)
   both entrants and lower attacks significantly reduce the hazard of
   disruption. Moreover, technology disruption is not permanent because of
   multiple crossings in technology performance and numerous rival
   technologies coexisting without one disrupting the other. The proposed
   predictive model of disruption shows good out-of-sample predictive
   accuracy. We discuss the implications of these findings.

AB Many firms have introduced Internet-based customer self-service
   applications such as online payments or brokerage services. Despite high
   initial sign-up rates, not all customers actually shift their dealings
   online. We investigate whether the multistage nature of the adoption
   process (an "adoption funnel") for such technologies can explain this
   low take-up. We use exogenous variation in events that possibly
   interrupt adoption, in the form of vacations and public holidays in
   different German states, to identify the effect on regular usage of
   being interrupted earlier in the adoption process. We find that
   interruptions in the early stages of the adoption process reduce a
   customer's probability of using the technology regularly. Our results
   suggest significant cost-saving opportunities from eliminating
   interruptions in the adoption funnel.

AB We study how multiattribute product choices are affected by peer
   influence. We propose a two-stage conjoint-based approach to examine
   three behavioral mechanisms of peer influence. We find that when faced
   with information on peer choices, consumers update their attribute
   preferences in a Bayesian manner. This suggests that greater uncertainty
   in the attribute preferences of a focal consumer and lesser uncertainty
   in preferences of peers both lead to greater preference revision.
   Greater number of peers is associated with greater preference revision,
   although the extent of preference revision diminishes with increasing
   number of peers. Furthermore, to address the significant time and costs
   associated with collecting sociometric data, we estimate the accuracy of
   predicted consumer choices when peer influence data are unavailable.
   Online social network membership and frequency of peer interactions
   provide better proxies than more common demographic similarity measures.
   These findings have key implications, especially for word-of-mouth
   marketing.

AB W e use data from a large-scale field experiment to explore what
   influences the effectiveness of online advertising. We find that
   matching an ad to website content and increasing an ad's obtrusiveness
   independently increase purchase intent. However, in combination, these
   two strategies are ineffective. Ads that match both website content and
   are obtrusive do worse at increasing purchase intent than ads that do
   only one or the other. This failure appears to be related to privacy
   concerns: the negative effect of combining targeting with obtrusiveness
   is strongest for people who refuse to give their income and for
   categories where privacy matters most. Our results suggest a possible
   explanation for the growing bifurcation in Internet advertising between
   highly targeted plain text ads and more visually striking but less
   targeted ads.

AB In "Online Display Advertising: Targeting and Obtrusiveness," Avi
   Goldfarb and Catherine Tucker present an empirical investigation and
   discussion of consumers' reactions to obtrusive and targeted Internet
   advertisements. They find, among other things, that obtrusive
   advertisements when combined with targeting tend to generate no greater
   effectiveness in consumer response than either method used alone.
   Perhaps one of the most interesting findings in their results involves
   the authors' focus on privacy salience and its connection to
   advertisement presentation. This brief discussion of their work (1)
   highlights the importance of further research in line with the
   well-crafted privacy preference inquiries of Goldfarb and Tucker's study
   and (2) complements the authors' discussion regarding possible public
   policy implications with a legal discussion elaborating on existing
   legal grounds for liability and restrictions on advertising consumers
   perceive as privacy invasive.

AB Automotive sales forecasts traditionally focus on predictors such as
   advertising, brand preference, life cycle position, retail price, and
   technological sophistication. The quality of the cars' design is,
   however, an often-neglected variable in such models. We show that
   incorporating objective measures of design prototypicality and design
   complexity in sales forecasting models improves their prediction by up
   to 19%. To this end, we professionally photographed the frontal designs
   of 28 popular models, morphed the images, and created objective
   prototypicality (car-to-morph Euclidian proximity) and complexity (size
   of a compressed image file) scores for each car. Results show that
   prototypical but complex car designs feel surprisingly fluent to
   process, and that this form of surprising fluency evokes positive gut
   reactions that become associated with the design and positively impact
   car sales. It is important to note that the effect holds for both
   economy (functionality oriented) and premium (identity oriented) cars,
   as well as when the above-mentioned traditional forecasting variables
   are considered. These findings are counter to a common intuition that
   consumers like unusual-complex designs that reflect their individuality
   or prototypical-simple designs that are functional.
