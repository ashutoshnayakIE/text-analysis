AB We examine the impact of point of sale (POS) data sharing on ordering
   decisions in a multi-echelon supply chain. In particular, we focus on
   how exposure to Pos data may help reduce the "bullwhip effect," the
   tendency of orders to increase in variability as one moves up a supply
   chain. Theoretical studies have shown that exposure to Pos data can lead
   to a reduction in the bullwhip effect when suppliers have no prior
   knowledge of the demand distribution. The benefit of sharing Pos data in
   stable industries, where the demand distribution is commonly known, is
   less clear. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in
   the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information
   lags and stochastic demand. We find, using a controlled simulation
   experiment, that sharing Pos information does help reduce some
   components of the bullwhip effect in a stable demand setting, namely the
   order oscillation of upstream members. We offer one possible explanation
   for this improvement by examining the relationship between order
   decisions and demand line information.

AB To investigate the conditions under which learning-by-hiring (or the
   acquisition of knowledge through the hiring of experts from other firms)
   is more likely, we study the patenting activities of engineers who moved
   from United States (U.S.) firms to non-U.S. firms. Statistical findings
   from negative binomial regressions show that mobility is more likely to
   result in interfirm knowledge transfer when (1) the hiring firm is less
   path dependent, (2) the hired engineers possess technological expertise
   distant from that-of the hiring firm, and (3) the hired engineers work
   in noncore technological areas in their new firm. In addition, the
   results support the idea that domestic mobility and international
   mobility are similarly conducive to learning-by-hiring. Thus, our paper
   suggests that learning-by-hiring can be useful when hired engineers are
   used for exploring technologically distant knowledge (rather than for
   reinforcing existing firm expertise) and also for extending the hiring
   firm's geographic reach.

   community of practice caught between two evolutionary logics by which
   valuable scientific knowledge and valuable innovations are selected. We
   analyze the publications and patents of 116 biotechnology firms during
   the period 1988-1995. In models that link scientific capabilities to
   patent citations, we show that scientific ideas are not simply inputs
   into inventions; important scientific ideas and influential patents
   follow different and conflicting selection logics. Publication,
   collaboration, and science intensity are associated with patented
   innovations; however, important scientific papers are negatively
   associated with high-impact innovations. These results point to
   conflicting logics between science and innovation, and scientists must
   contribute to both while inhabiting a single epistemic community. We
   identify individuals listed on patents and scientific papers and find
   they effectively integrate science with innovation, leading to more
   successful innovations. Our findings suggest that the role of the small,
   research-intensive firm is to create a repository of knowledge; to act
   as an organizational mechanism to combine the capabilities of versatile
   scientists within and outside the boundaries of the firm; and to manage
   the selection of scientific ideas to produce valuable technical
   innovations.

AB As a complement to the literature on learning in firms, we investigate
   learning in markets, a nascent area of study that focuses on how
   learning occurs between, rather than within, firms. The core idea behind
   our framework is that networks shape knowledge transfer and learning
   processes by creating channels for knowledge trade and reducing the risk
   of learning. In developing our framework, we elaborate on the knowledge
   transfer capabilities of different types of social ties, the
   informational properties of public and private knowledge, and how types
   of knowledge transfer and forms of learning follow from the networks
   within which firms embed their exchanges. We conducted fieldwork at
   Chicago-area banks to examine our framework's plausibility and
   application to learning in financial lending markets, a setting relevant
   to most firms. Findings indicate that learning is located not only in
   actors' cognitions or past experiences, but also in relations among
   actors, and that viewing learning as a social process helps solve
   problems regarding knowledge transfer and learning in markets.

   establish the link between problem-solving moves and productivity. We
   find that the mix of moves exercised in technical support strongly
   depends on the formulation of tasks by those requesting support. Because
   the formulation of tasks is performed by users, knowledge management
   initiatives must target users as well as support providers to have the

AB Research in organizational learning has demonstrated processes and
   occasionally performance implications of acquisition of declarative
   (know-what) and procedural (know-how) knowledge. However, considerably
   less attention has been paid to learned characteristics of relationships
   that affect the decision to seek information from other people. Based on
   a review of the social network, information processing, and
   organizational learning literatures, along with the results of a
   previous qualitative study, we propose a formal model of information
   seeking in which the probability of seeking information from another
   person is a function of (1) knowing what that person knows; (2) valuing
   what that person knows; (3) being able to gain timely access to that
   person's thinking; and (4) perceiving that seeking information from that
   person would not be too costly. We also hypothesize that the knowing,
   access, and cost variables mediate the relationship between physical
   proximity and information seeking. The model is tested using two
   separate research sites to provide replication. The results indicate
   strong support for the model and the mediation hypothesis (with the
   exception of the cost variable). Implications are drawn for the study of
   both transactive memory and organizational learning, as well as for
   management practice.

AB A growing body of research documents the role that organizational
   learning plays in improving firm performance over time. To date,
   however, this literature has given limited attention to the effect that
   the internal structure of the firm c an have on generating differences
   in these learning rates. This paper focuses on the degree to which
   interdependence-and in particular one structural characteristic that
   generates interdependence, vertical integration-affects organizational
   learning. Firms face a trade-off. In stable environments, vertically
   integrating severely limits the organization's ability to learn by doing
   because boundedly rational managers find the optimization of operations
   difficult when making highly interdependent choices. As the volatility
   of the environment increases though, integration can facilitate
   learning-by-doing by buffering activities within the firm from
   instability in the external environment. Thus, firms with a high degree
   of interdependence suffer less in these environments. Tests of these
   hypotheses on the growth and exit rates of computer workstation.
   manufacturers support this thesis.

   perceived experts were more likely than nonexperts to emphasize shared
   knowledge and other member's unique knowledge contributions.
   Additionally, socially isolated members participated more in discussions
   and emphasized more of their unique knowledge than did socially
   connected members. While unique knowledge contributions increased the
   positive perception of social isolates, similar unique knowledge
   contributions decreased the positive perception of socially connected
   members. Finally, socially connected group members gave greater
   attention to the unique knowledge contributions of the socially isolated

   more favorably evaluated members to whom they were more favorably
   connected than those to whom they were not. We discuss the implications

   insiders, we find that preferences for knowledge obtained from outsiders
   are also prevalent. Two complementary case studies and survey data from
   managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge more
   highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through which
   this process occurs. We found evidence that the preference for outsider
   knowledge is the result of managerial responses to (1) the contrasting
   status implications of learning from internal versus external
   competitors, and (2) the availability or scarcity of knowledge-internal
   knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater
   scrutiny, while external knowledge is more scarce, which makes it appear
   more special and unique. We conclude by considering some consequences of
   the external knowledge preference for organizational functioning.

   revealed that negotiators' schemas about the task (reflected in

   network externalities. In particular, this study is motivated by the
   divergent evolutions of the PC and the workstation markets in response
   to a new technology: reduced instruction set computing (RISC). In the PC
   market, Intel has developed new microprocessors by maintaining
   compatibility with the established architecture, whereas it was
   radically replaced by RISC in the workstation market. History indicates
   that unlike the PC market, the workstation market consisted of a large
   number of power users, who are less sensitive to compatibility than
   ordinary users. Our numerical analysis indicates that the exploration of
   a new, incompatible technology is more likely to increase the chance of
   firm growth when there are a substantial number of power users or when a
   new technology is introduced before an established technology takes off.

   dimensions. The knowledge management outcomes of knowledge creation,
   retention, and transfer are represented along one dimension. Properties
   of the context within which knowledge management occurs are represented
   on the other dimension. These properties, which affect knowledge
   management outcomes, can be organized according to whether they are
   properties of a unit (e.g., individual, group, organization) involved in
   knowledge management, properties of relationships between units or
   properties of the knowledge itself. The framework is used to identify
   where research findings about knowledge management converge and where
   gaps in our understanding exist. The article discusses mechanisms of
   knowledge management and how those mechanisms affect a unit's ability to
   create, retain and transfer knowledge. Emerging themes in the literature
   on knowledge management are identified. Directions for future research
   are suggested.

   investigate how the communication configuration affects a three-person

   strongly influences outcomes, and not always in ways that current theory
   anticipates. Competitive frictions, including a tendency to communicate
   offers privately, appear to shape much of what we observe. Our results
   suggest that parties with weaker alternatives would benefit from a more
   constrained structure, especially if they can be the conduit of
   communication, while those endowed with stronger alternatives would do
   well to work within a more public communication structure that promotes

   artery disease (CAD), each of which is associated with a distinct
   professional group within a hospital. These two groups are often
   characterized as engaging in a "turf war" for patients. After
   controlling for several factors that might explain technological
   choice-the clinical severity of patients, the relative quality of the
   two procedures at a given facility, firm-level financial performance,
   and other firm-level characteristics-I find that the technological
   status of the group associated with each technique affects the relative
   rate at which it is used within a given hospital. Moreover, this effect
   is strongest for patients at the margin between the two techniques.
   These results suggest that viewing the choice between competing
   innovations as a single, firm-level decision may not always capture the
   true dynamics underlying such a situation.

AB We consider the classic N-stage serial supply systems with linear costs
   and stationary random demands. There are deterministic transportation
   leadtimes between stages, and unsatisfied demands are backlogged. The
   optimal inventory policy for this system is known to be an echelon
   base-stock policy, which can be computed through minimizing, N nested
   convex functions recursively. To identify the key determinants, of the
   optimal policy, we, develop a simple and surprisingly good heuristic.
   This method minimizes 2N separate newsvendor-type cost functions, each
   of which uses the original problem data only. These functions are lower
   and upper bounds for the echelon cost functions; their minimizers form
   bounds for the optimal echelon base-stock levels. The heuristic is the
   simple average of the solution bounds. In extensive numerical
   experiments, the average relative error of the heuristic is 0.24%, with
   the maximum error less than 1.5%. The bounds and the, heuristic, which
   can be easily obtained by simple spreadsheet calculations, enhance the
   accessibility and implementability of the multiechelon inventory theory.
   More importantly, the closed form expressions provide an analytical tool
   for us to gain insights into issues such as system bottlenecks, effects
   of system parameters, and coordination mechanisms in decentralized
   systems.

AB Our paper suggests a simple, recursive residuals (out-of-sample)
   graphical approach to evaluating the predictive power of popular equity
   premium and stock market time-series forecasting regressions.. When
   applied, we find that dividend ratios should have been known to have no
   predictive ability even prior to the 1990s, and that any seeming ability
   even then was driven by only two years, 1973 and 1974. Our paper also
   documents changes in the time-series processes of the dividends
   themselves and shows that an increasing persistence of dividend-price
   ratio is largely responsible for the inability of dividend ratios to
   predict equity premia. Cochrane's (1997) accounting identity-that
   dividend ratios have to predict long-run dividend growth or stock
   returns-empirically holds only over horizons longer than 5-10 years.
   Over shorter horizons, dividend yields primarily forecast themselves.

AB We investigate the salesforce compensation strategy of a firm selling
   products in a category that several consumers find technically
   sophisticated, such as electronics or financial products with legal fine
   print. Consumers are unable to judge the value difference between a
   baseline product and a product upgrade with add-on features. While the
   firm and the salespeople are informed of the value of these features,
   consumers are uncertain. Thus consumers have to rely on sales assistance
   to evaluate alternatives. The salesperson decision variables include
   selling effort and whether to "oversell" the consumer by overclaiming
   the value of added features. Because sales revenue depends on both the
   salesperson's selling effort and consumers' valuation of the added
   features, the salesforce incentive scheme (which can consist of salary,
   sales commission, or consumer satisfaction-based commission) may induce
   the short-term oriented salesperson to misrepresent the value of the
   upgrade. Exaggeration of the value of the added features, however,
   results in reduced satisfaction levels leading to lower profits for the
   firm. We show that a salesperson selling products where the value of the
   upgrade is low prefers to make higher claims when the sales commission
   rate is sufficiently high. We conjecture that consumers aware of the
   incentive structure facing the salesperson expect the true value of the
   add-on feature to be lower than the claimed value. We study the optimal
   compensation scheme of a firm, which has to communicate her true type
   and retain its salesforce credibility. We identify the conditions under
   which a high-upgrade-type firm indicates its true value by altering
   sales commission rate and satisfaction-based commission rate.

AB Motivated by a study of the logistics systems used to manage consumable
   service parts for the U.S. military, we consider a static
   threshold-based rationing policy that is useful when pooling inventory
   across two demand classes characterized by different arrival rates and
   shortage (stockout and delay) costs. The scheme operates as a (Q, r)
   policy with the following feature. Demands from both classes are filled
   on a first-come-first-serve basis as long as on-hand inventory lies
   above a threshold level K. Once on-hand inventory falls below this
   level, low-priority (i.e., low shortage cost) demand is backordered
   while high-priority demand continues to be filled. We analyze this
   static policy first under the assumption that backorders are filled
   according to a special threshold clearing mechanism. Structural results
   for the key performance measures are established to enable an efficient
   solution algorithm for computing stock control and rationing parameters
   (i.e., Q, r, and K). Numerical results confirm that the solution under
   this special threshold clearing mechanism closely approximates that of
   the priority clearing policy. We next highlight conditions where our
   policy offers significant savings over traditional "round-up" and
   "separate stock" policies encountered in the military and elsewhere.
   Finally, we develop a lower bound on the cost of the optimal rationing
   policy. Numerical results show that the performance gap between our
   static threshold policy and the optimal policy is small in environments
   typical of the military and high-technology industries.

   modeled using a binary activity-resource matrix A called the
   availability matrix. Activity durations are known deterministically. We
   develop tight lower bounds and a variety of heuristics accompanied with
   extensive computational tests regarding their performance. It is shown
   that our algorithms consistently perform near optimally. Using these
   heuristics, we perform experiments on the effect of operating
   flexibility on project duration, where resource flexibility is measured
   by the number of resources available per activity, and the form of the
   availability matrix A. Our experiments lead to important managerial
   guidelines regarding the role of resource flexibility on project
   duration. For instance, it is found that when the flexible capabilities
   of the resources are evenly distributed across the activities, small
   improvements in resource flexibilities provide nearly the same benefits
   in project duration as a system of fully flexible resources.

AB Coordination among many interdependent actors in complex product
   development projects is recognized as a key activity in organizational
   theory. It is well known that this coordination becomes progressively
   more difficult with project size, but we do not yet sufficiently
   understand whether this effect can be controlled with frequent and rich
   communication among project members, or whether it is inevitable. Recent
   work in complexity theory suggests that a project might form a "rugged
   landscape," for which performance deterioration with system size is
   inevitable.
   This paper builds a mathematical model of a complex design project that
   is divided into components (subproblems) and integrated back to the
   system. The model explicitly represents local component decisions, as
   well as component interactions in determining system performance. The
   model shows, first, how a rugged performance landscape arises even from
   simple components with simple performance functions, if the components
   are interdependent.
   Second, we characterize the dynamic behavior of the system analytically
   and with simulations. We show under which circumstances it exhibits
   performance oscillations or divergence to design solutions with low
   performance. Third, we derive classes of managerial actions available to
   improve performance dynamics, such as modularization, immediate
   communication, and exchanging preliminary information. Some of these
   have not yet received adequate attention in literature and practice.

AB Recent research suggests that, due to organizational and relational
   constraints, firms are limited contextually-both geographically and
   technologically-in their search for new knowledge. But distant contexts
   may offer ideas and insights that can be extremely useful to innovation
   through knowledge recombination. So how can firms reach beyond their
   existing contexts in their search for new knowledge? In this paper, we
   suggest that two mechanisms-alliances and the mobility of inventors-can
   serve as bridges to distant contexts and, thus, enable firms to overcome
   the constraints of contextually localized search.
   Through the analysis of patent citation patterns in the semiconductor
   industry, we first demonstrate both the geographic and technological
   localization of knowledge. We then explore if the formation of alliances
   and mobility of active inventors facilitate interfirm knowledge flows
   across contexts. We find that mobility is associated with interfirm
   knowledge flows regardless of geographic proximity and, in fact, the
   usefulness of alliances and mobility increases with technological
   distance. These findings suggest that firms can employ knowledge
   acquisition mechanisms to fill in the holes of their existing
   technological and geographic context.

   organizational inertia to analyze the effect of quality improvement on
   infrastructure activity costs in software development. Although
   increasing evidence indicates that quality improvement reduces software
   development costs, the impact on infrastructure activities is not known.
   Infrastructure activities include services like computer operations,
   data integration, and configuration management that support software
   development. Because infrastructure costs represent a substantial
   portion of firms' information technology budgets, it is important to
   identify innovations that yield significant cost savings in
   infrastructure activities. We evaluate quality and cost data collected
   in nine infrastructure activity centers over 10 years of product
   development in a major software firm undergoing a quality
   transformation. Findings indicate that infrastructure activities do
   benefit from quality improvement. The greatest marginal cost savings are
   realized in infrastructure activities that are highly interdependent
   with development and that occur later in the software development life
   cycle. Organizational inertia influences the rapidity with which the
   infrastructure activities benefit from higher product quality,
   especially for the more specialized activities. Finally, our findings
   suggest that although the savings in infrastructure from quality
   improvement are substantial, there are diminishing returns to quality
   improvement in infrastructure activities.

AB We consider a simple, deterministic queueing system with feedback, which
   exhibits the phenomena of sustained oscillation, mode locking,
   quasi-periodic behaviour, and chaos. This implies that a fully
   deterministic queueing system can exhibit seemingly unpredictable
   behaviour. We ignore variability, and focus on two forms of feedback:
   (i) the service rate increases as queue length increases, and (ii) the
   arrival rate depends on customers' perception of past waiting times. We
   model a customer's decision to seek service as a two-stage process: (i)
   deciding whether or not to use a facility, and (ii) deciding the
   frequency of visit (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). This frequency is
   initially constant, and later on replaced by a deterministic,
   time-dependent pattern. Although highly stylised, this model captures
   the essential features of many real-life systems whose average arrival
   rate varies over time. Reducing the amplitude of cycles in demand makes
   the system more predictable and thus easier to manage. Although we
   represent this model as a queue of customers waiting for service, the
   model can be interpreted more generally as any situation where an
   increase in demand lowers the quality of service.

   replenishment orders with a common manufacturing capacity. The
   two,retailers differ in the variability of their order-streams. The
   order-stream from one retail warehouse is modeled as a Poisson process
   and from the other as a hyperexponential renewal process. Each retail
   warehouse uses a base-stock policy to place replenishment orders with,
   the manufacturer. The manufacturer is modeled as a
   first-come-first-serve, single exponential server queue. We analyze the
   supply-side impact of this mixture of order-streams received by the
   manufacturer on both retailers. An exact analysis of this base-model
   generates closed-form expressions for distributions of the. lead-time,
   outstanding orders, and expected inventory. costs for each retailer, and
   leads to comparative results about the two retailers' performance
   measures. The base-model is extended to accommodate finished goods at
   the manufacturer, more than two,, retailers, and bulk-arrivals. We use
   the model to suggest managerial insights about the impact of the
   presence of a high-variability retailer on other retailers who share
   capacity, the distorting impact of manufacturer finished goods inventory
   on retailer incentives, and the incentives for retailers to participate
   in variability-reduction programs in the grocery industry.

AB Process flexibility whereby a production facility can produce multiple
   products, is a critical design consideration in multiproduct supply
   chains facing uncertain demand. The challenge is to determine a
   cost-effective flexibility configuration that is able to meet the demand
   with high likelihood. In this paper, we present a framework for
   analyzing the benefits from flexibility in multistage supply chains. We
   find two phenomena, stage-spanning bottlenecks and floating bottlenecks,
   neither of which are present in single-stage supply chains, which reduce
   the effectiveness of a flexibility configuration. We. develop a
   flexibility measure g,and show that increasing this measure results
   in,greater protection from these supply-chain inefficiencies. We also
   identify flexibility guidelines that perform very well for multistage
   supply chains. These guidelines employ and adapt the single-stage
   chaining strategy of Jordan and Graves (1995) to multistage supply
   chains.

AB One charge of the United States Environmental Protection Agency is to
   study the risk of infection for microbial agents that can be
   disseminated through drinking water systems and to recommend water
   treatment policy to counter that risk. Recently proposed dynamical
   system models quantify indirect risks due to secondary transmission, in
   addition to primary infection risk from the water supply considered by
   standard assessments. Unfortunately, key parameters that influence water
   treatment policy are unknown, in part because of lack of data and
   effective inference methods. This paper develops inference methods for
   those parameters by using stochastic process models to better
   incorporate infection dynamics into the inference process. Our use of
   endemic data provides an alternative to waiting for, identifying; and
   measuring an outbreak. Data both from: simulations and from New York
   City illustrate the approach.

AB This paper presents a formal theory of subjective rationality and
   demonstrates its application to corporate strategy. An agent is said to
   be subjectively rational when decisions are consistent with the
   available facts and, where these are lacking, with the agent's own
   subjective assessments. A self-confirming equilibrium arises when
   agents' subjectively rational actions generate events that are
   consistent with their own expectations. Equilibrium strategies may be
   suboptimal because certain counterfactual beliefs may be erroneous and
   yet fail to be contradicted by events observed in equilibrium. This
   weakening of the stronger rationality assumptions inherent in many of
   the more familiar equilibrium ideas appears well suited to applications
   in strategy. In particular, performance advantage may be sustained by a
   firm when its subjectively rational competitors persistently employ
   suboptimal self-confirming strategies.

   where the objective function is the sum of separable convex functions
   (that is, of the form Sigma((i,j)is an element ofQ) (F) over bar
   (ij)(omega(ij)) + Sigma(iis an element ofP) (B) over bar (i)(mu(i))),
   the constraints. are similar to those arising in the dual of a minimum
   cost flow problem (that is, of the form mu(i) - mu(j) less than or equal
   to omega(ij), (i, j) is an element of Q), with lower and upper bounds on
   variables. Let n = \P\, m = \Q\, and U be the largest magnitude in the
   lower and upper bounds of variables. We call this problem the convex
   cost integer dual network flow problem. In this paper, we describe
   several applications of the convex cost integer dual network flow
   problem arising in a dial-a-ride transit problem, inverse spanning tree
   problem, project management and regression analysis. We develop network
   flow-based algorithms to solve the convex cost integer dual network flow
   problem. We show that using the Lagrangian relaxation technique, the
   convex cost integer dual network flow problem can be transformed into a
   convex cost primal network flow problem where each cost function is a
   piecewise linear convex function with integer slopes. Its special
   structure allows the convex cost primal network flow problem to be
   solved in O(nm log(n(2)/m)log(nU)) time. This time bound is the same
   time needed to solve the minimum cost flow problem using the
   cost-scaling algorithm, and is also is best available time bound to

AB It is often assumed that financial markets are frictionless. Bond
   markets are illiquid and bond prices are observed with errors. The
   magnitude of these errors leads to violation of no-arbitrage conditions
   and, consequently, prevents researchers from obtaining an estimate of
   the term structure (TS) of interest rates. Researchers have had to
   settle for a second-best estimate of the TS (e.g., obtained via
   regression) at a cost of an economically unrealistic assumption of
   symmetric market frictions. The true shape of market frictions, however,
   is not known and generally is a highly complex issue. A
   no-arbitrage-based methodology that avoids making detrimental
   assumptions is developed here. It facilitates empirical investigation of
   the shape of the market frictions and of the TS that are simultaneously
   imputed from market data assuming "efficient" market frictions that
   minimize the maximum net arbitrage. The empirical investigation
   performed in the Canadian and U.S. markets shows that in both markets
   the frictions are asymmetric and the estimates of the TS produced via
   regression and our methodology significantly differ.

AB In this paper, we analyze demand postponement as a strategy to handle
   potential demand surges. Under demand postponement, a fraction of the
   demands from the "regular" period are postponed and satisfied during a
   "postponement" period. This permits capacity to be procured to satisfy
   the postponed demands. A reimbursement per unit is paid to customers
   whose demands are postponed. The basic idea is that by preempting
   stockouts through demand postponement, we can reduce overall stockout
   costs. We formulate and solve a two-stage capacity planning problem
   under demand postponement. We propose a power range class of
   distributions to capture the nature of demand surges. We establish the
   scalability and conjugate properties of the power range distributions
   under demand postponement, which leads to a tractable analysis of the
   problem. We analytically solve the problem of determining the optimal
   regular and postponement period capacities, and the demand splitting
   rule to minimize the supplier's expected cost. We show that (a) the
   value of postponement may be significant depending on cost and demand
   parameters, (b) a postponement strategy may lead to reduced investment
   in initial capacity, and (c) it may be optimal to do no demand
   postponement over a range of demands even after observing a higher
   demand signal. We then relax several model assumptions and provide
   results for these extensions. We conclude with managerial insights.

   high-quality new ventures may be able to credibly signal their type by
   appointing reputable directors to their boards. However, this option is
   not universally feasible. Both directors' reputations and the quality of
   their information determine the effectiveness of this strategy. In
   contrast to earlier adverse selection models, we demonstrate that when
   the middlemen (directors) have incomplete information on firm quality,
   bad and good firms can coexist in equilibrium. In this equilibrium, the
   quality of the directors' information determines the mix of good and bad
   firms in the population of surviving firms. Avenues for future research

AB This paper considers pricing and capacity sizing decisions, in a
   single-class Markovian model motivated by communication and information
   services. The service provider is assumed to operate a finite set of
   processing resources that can be shared among users; however, this
   shared mode of operation results in a service-rate degradation. Users,
   in turn, are sensitive to the delay implied by the potential degradation
   in service rate, and to the usage fee charged for accessing the system.
   We study the equilibrium behavior of such systems in the specific
   context of pricing and capacity sizing under revenue and social
   optimization objectives. Exact solutions to these problems can only be
   obtained via exhaustive simulations. In contrast, we pursue approximate
   solutions that exploit large-capacity asymptotics. Economic
   considerations and natural scaling relations demonstrate that the
   optimal operational mode for the system is close to "heavy traffic."
   This, in turn, supports the derivation of simple approximate solutions
   to economic optimization problems, via asymptotic methods that
   completely alleviate the need for simulation. These approximations seem
   to be extremely accurate. The main insights that are gleaned in the
   analysis follow: congestion costs are "small," the optimal price admits
   a two-part decomposition, and the joint capacity sizing and pricing
   problem decouples and admits simple analytical solutions that are
   asymptotically optimal. All of the above phenomena are intimately
   related to statistical economies of scale that are an intrinsic part of
   these systems.

AB The Internet provides an unprecedented capability for sellers to learn
   about their customers and offer custom products at special prices. In
   addition, customization is more feasible today because of advances in
   manufacturing technologies that have improved sellers' manufacturing
   flexibility. We first develop a model of product customization and
   flexible pricing to incorporate the salient roles of the Internet and
   flexible manufacturing technologies in reducing the costs of designing
   and producing tailored consumer goods. We show how a monopoly seller may
   earn the highest profits by producing both standard and custom products
   and can raise prices for both types of products as customization and
   information collection technologies improve.
   Simultaneous adoption of customization in a duopoly reduces the
   differentiation between their standard products but does not intensify
   price competition. Compared with a. two-facility monopolist, the duopoly
   may underinvest in customization. Consumer surplus improves after
   sellers adopt customization. but does not monotonically increase as
   customization technologies advance. When firms face a fixed entry cost
   and adopt customization sequentially, the first entrant always achieves
   an advantage and may be able to deter subsequent entry by choosing its
   customization scope strategically.

   We show that it is possible, using these data, to recover essential
   features of the underlying distribution of consumer willingness to pay.
   Knowledge of this distribution may enable the retailer to generate
   additional profits from targeting by using choice information at the
   checkout counter. In estimating demand we incorporate a supply-side
   model of the distribution channel that captures important features of
   competitive price-setting behavior of firms. This latter aspect helps us
   control for the potential endogeneity generated by unmeasured product
   characteristics in aggregate data. The channel controls for competitive
   aspects both between manufacturers and between manufacturers and a
   retailer. Despite this competition, we find that targeted pricing need
   not generate the prisoner's dilemma in our data. This contrasts with the
   findings of theoretical models due to the flexibility of the empirical
   model of demand. The demand system we estimate captures richer forms of
   product differentiation, both vertical and horizontal, as well as a more
   flexible distribution of consumer heterogeneity.

AB We consider a supply chain in which two suppliers compete for supply to
   a customer. Pricing and delivery-frequency decisions in the system are
   analyzed by two three-stage noncooperative games with different decision
   rights designated to the parties involved. The customer first sets the
   price (or delivery frequency) for each supplier. Then, the suppliers
   offer the delivery frequencies (or prices) simultaneously and
   independently. Finally, the customer determines how much demand to
   allocate to each of the suppliers. We show that delivery frequency,
   similar to delivery speed in time-based competition, can be a source of
   competitive advantage. It also allows firms that sell identical products
   to offer complementary services to the customer because she can lower
   her inventory with deliveries from more suppliers. In general, higher
   delivery frequencies lower the value of getting deliveries from the
   second supplier and therefore intensify price competition. Assuming the
   cost structures do not change and the suppliers are identical, we show
   that when the customer controls deliveries, she would strategically
   increase delivery frequencies to lower prices. The distortion in
   delivery frequencies is larger and the overall performance of the supply
   chain is lower when the customer, not the suppliers, controls
   deliveries. Moreover, the customer is better off under delivery
   competition, while the suppliers are better off under price competition.

AB We consider a two-stage supply chain under centralized control. The
   downstream facility faces discrete stochastic demand and passes supply
   requests to the upstream facility. The upstream facility always meets
   the supply requests from downstream. If the upstream facility cannot
   meet the supply requests from inventory on hand, the shortage must be
   filled by expediting, which will incur per unit and setup costs. Such
   expediting may take the form of overtime production, which occurs at the
   end of the period and incurs relatively high production costs, or
   premium freight shipments, which involves building products at the
   beginning of the period they are needed and shipping them very quickly
   with relatively high shipping costs. We consider the case where one
   method of filling shortages is available and determine novel optimal
   inventory policies under centralized control. At both stages, threshold
   policies that depend only on the current inventory in the system are
   optimal; for the total inventory in the system, a base-stock policy is
   optimal. Numerical analysis provides insight into the optimal policies
   and allows us to compare the supply chains under centralized and
   decentralized control.

EP 1179
PD SEP 2003
PY 2003
AB This paper deals with a single-echelon inventory system consisting of a
   number of parallel local warehouses facing compound Poisson demand.
   There are standard holding and backorder costs as well as ordering costs
   at all warehouses. Normally, the warehouses replenish from an outside
   supplier. However, lateral transshipments between the warehouses are
   also possible. Such transshipments take no time but incur additional
   costs. When a demand,occurs at a warehouse, the question is whether the
   whole demand or part of it should be covered by a lateral transshipment
   from another warehouse. Given a set of alternative decisions, our
   decision rule minimizes the expected costs under the assumption that no
   further transshipments will take place. This rule is then used
   repeatedly as a heuristic. A simulation study illustrates how the
   suggested technique performs under different conditions.

   and product development settings. By framing the task of knowledge
   integration as a cycle, we highlight the inability of current knowledge
   transfer theories to explain the consequences that arise from the
   path-dependent nature of knowledge. We compare the complexity of this
   knowledge integration task to previous efforts in terms of its novelty
   and the organizational properties of specialization and dependence that
   are required. Drawing on evidence from two empirical studies, we outline
   three stages of the "knowledge transformation cycle," which addresses
   the complexity of this integration task. We conclude with the
   implications of this knowledge transformation cycle on our understanding
   of knowledge management and organizational learning.

AB A boycott is never far from a firm's exchanges with its customers.
   Researchers in marketing need to understand consumer protest behavior,
   both to aid nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who wish to organize
   boycotts, and to assist managers who wish to develop appropriate
   strategic responses. Boycotts, like many other instances of collective
   action, are subject to free-rider and small-agent problems: there
   appears to be little or no motivation for an individual to participate.
   Yet they assuredly occur. We take an economic and psychological approach
   to the study of boycotts. Our approach is to develop a typology of
   motivations for consumer boycotts, to embed these motivations explicitly
   in a dynamic economic model, and thus to offer explanations for the
   extent of boycott participation.

AB This paper presents a detailed analysis of the numerical implementation
   of the American put option decomposition into an equivalent European
   option plus an early exercise premium (Kim 1990, Jacka 1991, Carr et al.
   1992). It subsequently introduces a. new algorithm based upon this
   decomposition and Richardson extrapolation. This new algorithm is based
   upon (a) the derivation of the correct order for the error term when
   applying Richardson extrapolation, which is used to control the error of
   the extrapolated prices, (b) an innovative adjustment of Kim's (1990)
   discrete-time early exercise premium, so that these premiums
   monotonically converge and, therefore, it is appropriate to use them in
   extrapolation, and (c) the optimal exercise frontier can be quickly
   computed through Newton's method, permitting the efficient
   implementation of the decomposition formula in practice. Numerical
   experiments show that this new algorithm is accurate, efficient, easy to
   implement, and competitive in comparison with other methods. Finally, it
   can also be applied to other American exotic securities.

AB In goal-oriented services, consumers want to get transported from one
   well-defined state (start) to another (destination) state without much
   concern for intermediate states. A cost-based evaluation of such
   services should depend on the total cost associated with the
   service-i.e., the price and the amount of time taken for completion. In
   this paper, we demonstrate that the characteristics of the path to the
   final destination also influence evaluation and choice. Specifically, we
   show that segments of idle time and travel away from the final
   destination are seen as obstacles in the progress towards the
   destination, and hence lower the choice likelihood of the path. Further,
   we show that the earlier such obstacles occur during the service, the
   lower is the choice likelihood. We present an analytical model of
   consumer choice and test its predictions in a series of experiments. Our
   results show that in choosing between two services that cover the same
   displacement in the same time (i.e., identical average progress),
   consumer choice is driven by the perception of progress towards the goal
   (i.e., by virtual progress). In a final experiment, we show that the
   effects of virtual progress may outweigh the effects of actual average
   progress.

AB Based on measurements among 332 owner-managers, we investigate how the
   global shape of the utility function (i.e., S-shaped versus concave or
   convex over the total range of outcomes) relates to choice behavior. We
   find that the global shape of the utility function differs across
   decision makers (about one-third of the owner-managers exhibit an
   S-shaped utility function) and that the global shape is linked to
   organizational behavior (i.e., the production system employed), a result
   that does not change when using different methods to identify the
   decision maker's global shape of the utility function. The decision
   maker's risk attitude (risk averse or risk seeking) does not affect the
   choice of the production system. Whereas the degree of risk aversion,
   based on the local shape of the utility function, may be important in
   explaining owner-managers' trading behavior (Pennings and Smidts 2000),
   more structural organizational behavior appears to be linked to the
   global shape of the utility function.

AB The benefits of dynamic pricing methods have long been known in
   industries, such as airlines, hotels, and electric utilities, where the
   capacity is fixed in the short-term and perishable. In recent years,
   there has been an increasing adoption of dynamic pricing policies in
   retail and other industries, where the sellers have the ability to store
   inventory. Three factors contributed to this phenomenon: (1) the
   increased availability of demand data, (2) the ease of changing prices
   due to new technologies, and (3) the availability of decision-support
   tools for analyzing demand data and for dynamic pricing. This paper
   constitutes a review of the literature and current practices in dynamic
   pricing. Given its applicability in most markets and its increasing
   adoption in practice, our focus is on dynamic (intertemporal) pricing in
   the presence of inventory considerations.

AB The application of Internet-based virtual stock markets (VSMs) is an
   additional approach that can be used to predict short- and medium-term
   market developments. The basic concept involves bringing a group of
   participants together via the Internet and allowing them to trade shares
   of virtual stocks. These stocks represent a bet on the outcome of future
   market situations, and their value depends on the realization of these
   market situations. In this process, a VSM elicits and aggregates the
   assessments of its participants concerning future market developments.
   The aim of this article is to evaluate the potential use and the
   different design possibilities as well as the forecast accuracy and
   performance of VSMs compared to expert predictions for their application
   to business forecasting. After introducing the basic idea of using VSMs
   for business forecasting, we discuss the different design possibilities
   for such VSMs. In three real-world applications, we analyze the
   feasibility and forecast accuracy of VSMs, compare the performance of
   VSMs to expert predictions, and propose a new validity test for VSM
   forecasts. Finally, we draw conclusions and provide suggestions for
   future research.

AB Previous work on the solution to analytical electronic customer
   relationship management (eCRM) problems has used either data-mining (DM)
   or optimization methods, but has not combined the two approaches. By
   leveraging the strengths of both approaches, the eCRM problems of
   customer analysis, customer interactions, and the optimization of
   performance metrics (such as the lifetime value of a customer on the
   Web) can be better analyzed. In particular, many eCRM problems have been
   traditionally addressed using DM methods. There are opportunities for
   optimization to improve these methods, and this paper describes these
   opportunities. Further, an online appendix
   (mansci.pubs.informs.org/ecompanion.html) describes how DM methods can
   help optimization-based approaches. More generally, this paper argues
   that the reformulation of eCRM problems within this new framework of
   analysis can result in more powerful analytical approaches.

   papers appearing in this second part from the perspective of two key
   questions concerning the impact of the emerging digital economy on
   management science research: What fundamentally new research questions
   arise, and what kind of research enables progress on them. We then offer
   summary comments on the second question based on the papers in both
   parts. The principal conclusions are that, in meeting the challenges
   posed by the digital economy, management science researchers are (a)
   making greater use of parts of economics and computer
   science/information technology, and (b) exploiting the improving
   productivity advantages of empirical and methodological work in
   comparison with theoretical work.

AB The Internet's computational power and flexibility have made auctions a
   widespread and integral part of both consumer and business markets.
   Though online auctions are a multibillion dollar annual activity, with a
   growing variety of sophisticated trading mechanisms, scientific research
   on them is at an early stage. This paper analyzes the current state of
   management science research on online auctions. It develops a broad
   research agenda for issues such as the behavior of online auction
   participants, the optimal design of online auctions, the integration of
   auctions into the ongoing operation of firms, and the use of the data
   generated by online auctions to inform future trading mechanisms. These
   research areas will draw from applied and theoretical work spanning
   management science, economics, and information systems.

AB Combinatorial auctions have two features that greatly affect their
   design: computational complexity of winner determination and
   opportunities for cooperation among competitors. Dealing with these
   forces trade-offs between desirable auction properties such as
   allocative efficiency, revenue maximization, low transaction costs,
   fairness, failure freeness, and scalability. Computational complexity
   can be dealt with algorithmically by relegating the computational burden
   to bidders, by maintaining fairness in the face of computational
   limitations, by limiting biddable combinations, and by limiting the use
   of combinatorial bids. Combinatorial auction designs include
   single-round, first-price sealed bidding, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
   mechanisms, uniform and market-clearing price auctions, and iterative
   combinatorial. auctions. Combinatorial auction designs must deal with
   exposure problems, threshold problems, ways to keep the bidding moving
   at a reasonable pace, avoiding and resolving ties, and controlling
   complexity.

AB Internet-enabled markets are becoming viable venues for procurement of
   professional services. We investigate bidding behavior within the most
   active area of these early knowledge markets-the market for software
   development. These markets are important both because they provide an
   early view of the effectiveness of online service markets and because
   they have a potentially large impact on how software development
   services are procured and provided. Using auction theory, we develop a
   theoretical model that relates market characteristics to bidding and
   transaction behavior, taking into account costly bidding. We then test
   our model using data from an active online market for software
   development services, which yields contracts for 30%-40% of posted
   projects. In its current format, however, the studied market may induce
   excessive bidding by vendors. Consistent with our theoretical
   predictions and those of Carr (2003), higher-value projects attract
   significantly more bids, with lower average quality. Greater numbers of
   bids raise the cost to all participants, due to costly bidding and bid
   evaluation. Perhaps as a consequence, higher-value projects are also
   much less likely to be awarded.

AB As seen in the data of Snir and Hitt (2003), online service procurement
   auctions often end without achieving a contract despite active bidding,
   yet the existing auction literature is silent on why this occurs. One
   explanation for these unconsummated auctions may be that perfectly
   acceptable bids are submitted but disregarded because of the cost of
   assessing the bids' viability and the bidders' capabilities. This note
   examines this possibility by characterizing optimal and equilibrium
   bidding and bid-evaluation decisions in the presence of these costs.

AB We consider a manufacturer who uses a reverse, or procurement, auction
   to determine which supplier will be awarded a contract. Each bid
   consists of a price and a set of nonprice attributes (e.g., quality,
   lead time). The manufacturer is assumed to know the parametric form of
   the suppliers' cost functions (in terms of the nonprice attributes), but
   has no prior information on the parameter values. We construct a
   multiround open-ascending auction mechanism, where the manufacturer
   announces a slightly different scoring rule (i.e., a function that ranks
   the bids in terms of the price and nonprice attributes) in each round.
   Via inverse optimization, the manufacturer uses the bids from the first
   several rounds to learn the suppliers' cost functions, and then in the
   final round chooses a scoring rule that attempts to maximize his own
   utility. Under the assumption that suppliers submit their myopic
   best-response bids in the last round, and do not distort their bids in
   the earlier rounds (i.e., they choose their minimum-cost bid to achieve
   any given score), our mechanism, indeed, maximizes the manufacturer's
   utility within the open-ascending format. We also discuss several
   enhancements that improve the robustness of our mechanism with respect
   to the model's informational and behavioral assumptions.

   We survey currently operational online group-buying markets, and then
   study this phenomenon using analytical models. We build on the

   analytical model of a monopolist offering Web-based group-buying under
   different kinds of demand uncertainty. We derive the monopolist's
   optimal group-buying schedule under varying conditions of heterogeneity
   in the demand regimes, and compare its profits with those that obtain
   under the more conventional posted-price mechanism. We further study the
   impact of production postponement by endogenizing the timing of the
   pricing and production decisions in a two-stage game between the
   monopolist and buyers. Our results have implications for firms' choice
   of price-discovery mechanisms in e-markets, and for the scheduling of
   production and pricing. decisions in the presence (and absence) of scale
   economies of production.

AB We study the offers submitted by consumers to a large
   Name-Your-Own-Price (NYOP) online retailer. A distinctive feature of
   this retailer is that it allows consumers to repeatedly submit offers on
   one and the same product. While consumers could identify the threshold
   price (the minimum price for which the retailer is willing to sell) by
   incrementing their offer in small steps in each consecutive round, such
   a strategy would require them to go through many additional online
   transactions. We define frictional cost as the disutility that the
   consumer experiences when conducting an online transaction, such as
   submitting an offer. Thus, in our setting, consumers trade off a direct
   financial value (lower price) for frictional costs. Based on a consumer
   choice model capturing this trade-off, we use the observed consumer
   behavior to reconstruct the frictional cost parameters for the consumers
   in our sample. We show that, perhaps contrary to the general wisdom,
   frictional costs in electronic markets are substantial, with median
   values ranging from EUR 3.54 for a portable digital music player (MP3)
   to EUR 6.08 for a personal digital assistant (PDA). We find that
   consumers who have gathered experience with the NYOP channel in previous
   transactions exhibit lower frictional costs than consumers who use the
   channel for the first time. Surprisingly, sociodemographic variables do
   not help to explain the variation in frictional costs.

AB W e present a framework and empirical estimates that quantify the
   economic impact of increased product variety made available through
   electronic markets. While efficiency gains from increased competition
   significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance, by leading to
   lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased
   product variety made available through electronic markets can be a
   significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains..
   One reason for increased product variety on the Internet is the ability
   of online retailers to catalog, recommend, and provide a large number of
   products for sale. For example, the number of book titles available at
   Amazon.com is more than 23 times larger than the number of books on the
   shelves of a typical Barnes & Noble superstore, and 57 times greater
   than the number of books stocked in a typical large independent
   bookstore.
   Our analysis indicates that the increased product variety of online
   bookstores enhanced consumer welfare by $731 million to $1.03 billion in
   the year 2000, which is between 7 and 10 times as large as the consumer
   welfare gain from increased competition and lower prices in this market.
   There may also be large welfare gains in other SKU-intensive consumer
   goods such as music, movies, consumer electronics, and computer software
   and hardware.

AB his paper surveys the underlying theory and practice in the use of
   options in support of emerging business-to-business (B2B) markets. Such
   options, on both capacity and output, play an important role in
   integrating long- and short-term contracting between multiple buyers and
   sellers in such markets. This trend is especially important in
   capital-intensive industries, where improvements in fine tuning the
   coordination of supply and demand carry large economic benefits.
   Typically, such options are benchmarked (or defined) on the basis of
   spot market information conveyed through near real-time B2B
   transactions. This paper notes a broad set of goods and services
   currently being traded in both B2B short-run markets and long-term
   contract markets, and reviews economic and managerial frameworks that
   have been proposed to explain the structure of contracting in these
   markets. We provide a general framework based on transactions cost
   economics, and we use this framework to provide a review and synthesis
   of existing literature to explain various types of contracting linked to
   B2B exchanges in capital-intensive industries. The paper concludes with
   a discussion of implementation challenges and open research questions.

AB Many clinics that offer in vitro fertilization (IVF) have begun to
   market the following options to couples: (1) an a la carte program where
   the couple pays $7,500 per attempt regardless of the outcome; or (2) a
   money-back-guarantee program where the couple pays a $15,000 fee that
   covers up to three attempts, however, if after three cycles there is no
   live-birth delivery, then the full $15,000 is refunded.
   We assess the a la carte versus the money-back-guarantee programs, and
   find the surprising result that the money-back-guarantee program appears
   (for the patients) to be "too good to be true." That is, the money-back
   guarantee yields a substantial negative expected profit per couple for
   the clinics. More importantly from the patients' perspective, the
   money-back guarantee is the better option for all couples with less than
   0.5 success probability per cycle. Virtually all traditional IVF
   patients have had per-cycle success probabilities below 0.5.
   A detailed analysis of the key variables - i.e., success rate per
   attempt, heterogeneity of couples' rates of success, individual couples'
   "learning" on successive attempts, and cost to the clinic per
   attempt-shows that these money-back guarantees are unprofitable for the
   clinics. Since presumably clinics are not in business to lose money, the
   standard analysis must be missing something major. We suggest that the
   marketing of money-back guarantees is inducing couples who would
   previously have used-successfully-other less invasive procedures with
   fewer side effects and less risk of multiple births to decide to proceed
   directly to IVF, and that this scenario makes the money-back guarantees
   profitable for the clinics.
   The implications of earlier use of IVF are then considered from an
   overall public policy point of view. just as mothers everywhere tell
   their children, "When something looks too good to be true, then it is
   too good to be true!"

AB We consider the order-fulfillment process of a supplier producing a
   customized capital good, such as production equipment, commercial
   aircraft, medical devices, or defense systems. As is common in these
   industries, prior to receiving a firm purchase order from the customer,
   the supplier receives a series of shared forecasts, which are called
   "soft orders." Facing a stochastic internal manufacturing lead time, the
   supplier must decide at what time to begin the fulfillment of the order.
   This decision requires a trade-off between starting too early, leading
   to potential holding or cancellation costs, and starting too late,
   leading to potential delay costs. We collect detailed data of shared
   forecasts, actual purchase orders, production lead times, and delivery
   dates for a supplier-buyer dyad in the semiconductor equipment supply
   chain. Under the assumption that the supplier acts rationally, optimally
   balancing the cancellation, holding, and delay costs, we are able to
   estimate the corresponding imputed cost parameters based on the observed
   data. Our estimation results reveal that the supplier perceives the cost
   of cancellation to be about two times higher and the holding costs to be
   about three times higher than the delay cost. In other words, the
   supplier is very conservative when commencing the order fulfillment,
   which undermines the effectiveness of the overall forecast-sharing
   mechanism.

   contend that despite the firm's best efforts to erect governance
   structures that reduce opportunism and preserve outcomes, there is
   always some opportunism that remains once the transaction is in,place.
   Despite this, there are few studies that systematically investigate the
   safeguarding efficacy of relationship attributes in the presence of such
   ex post opportunism. In this research, we develop a theoretical
   framework and provide a longitudinal test of the ability of various
   relationship safeguards to preserve performance outcomes and future
   expectations given varying levels of ex post opportunism in the
   relationship. Our survey results from over 300 buyers and suppliers
   indicates that given lower levels of opportunism, bilateral
   idiosyncratic investments and interpersonal trust enhance performance
   outcomes and future expectations, while goal congruence has no
   discernable effect. However, at higher levels of opportunism, goal
   congruence becomes a more powerful safeguard, while interpersonal trust
   becomes less effective. Bilateral idiosyncratic investments continue to
   preserve performance outcomes and future expectations even at higher
   levels of opportunism. Implications for the long-term management of
   interorganizational alliances are discussed.

   allocation problem in multisite service systems with intersite customer
   flows. We aim at providing insights to and guidelines for resource
   allocation in these service systems when some service criterion, such as
   average waiting time, loss rate, or blocking probability, is a major
   concern. We develop analytical optimization models and from them we
   obtain the explicit optimal allocation policy. Our results demonstrate
   that the optimal resource allocation solution exhibits a structure of
   "one large and many small."

AB Stiving (2000) proposes an interesting model to explain price-endings.
   His analysis shows that even when customer demand increases at 9-ending
   price points, certain firms that use high prices to signal quality are
   more likely to set those prices at round numbers. This comment raises
   two issues about the model. First, it appears that the original paper
   imposes a condition that has the effect of eliminating a broad range of
   legitimate separating equilibria from the analyses. Second, it appears
   that the original model does not include constraints to ensure that the
   demand for each market segment will be nonnegative. When these
   constraints on demand are included, one obtains different aggregate
   demand curves, which leads to different equilibrium prices. Using the
   revised model and analysis, we find that 71% of the prices end in 9 and
   only 12% in 0. This contrasts with only 3% ending in 9 and 58% ending in
   0 for the original study. Therefore, 9-endings still prevail even though
   high prices can be used by firms to signal high quality.

AB Operations and Supply Chains is the current title for a department that
   has evolved through several different titles in recent years, reflecting
   its evolving mission from a focus on classical operations research at
   the time of ORSXs founding 50 years ago toward art embrace of a broader
   body of theory. Throughout this evolution, the focus on applied problems
   and the goal of improving practice through the development of suitable
   theory has remained constant.
   The Operations and Supply Chains Department promotes the theory
   underlying the practice of operations management, which encompasses the
   design and management of the transformation processes in manufacturing
   and service organizations that create value for society. Operations is
   the function that is uniquely associated with the design and management
   of these processes. The problem domains of concern to the department
   have been, and remain, the marshalling of inputs, the transformation
   itself, and the distribution of outputs in pursuit of this
   value-creating end. Over the past 50 years the department has had a
   variety of titles, reflecting an evolving understanding of the
   boundaries of the operations function.
   In this article we celebrate past accomplishments, identify current
   challenges, and anticipate a future that is as exciting and
   opportunity-rich as any our field has seen.

AB Customer choice behavior, such as buy-up and buy-down, is an important
   phenomenon in a wide range of revenue management contexts. Yet most
   revenue management methodologies ignore this phenomenon - or at best
   approximate it in a heuristic way. In this paper, we provide an exact
   and quite general analysis of this problem. Specifically, we analyze a
   single-leg reserve management problem in which the buyers' choice
   behavior is modeled explicitly. The choice model is very general, simply
   specifying the probability of purchase for each fare product as a
   function of the set of fare products offered. The control problem is to
   decide which subset of fare products to offer at each point in time. We
   show that the optimal policy for this-problem has a quite simple form.
   Namely, it consists of identifying an ordered family of "efficient"
   subsets S-1,...,S-m, and at each point in time,opening one of these sets
   S-k, where,the optimal. index k is increasing in the remaining capacity
   x and decreasing in the remaining time. That is, the more capacity (or
   less time) available, the further the optimal set is along
   this,sequence. We also show that the optimal policy is a nested
   allocation policy if and only if the sequence of efficient sets is
   nested, that is S-1 subset of or equal to S-2 subset of or equal to ...
   subset of or equal to S-m. Moreover, we give a characterization of when
   nesting by fare order is optimal. We also develop an estimation
   procedure for this setting based on the expectation-maximization (EM)
   method that jointly estimates arrival rates and choice model parameters
   when no-purchase outcomes are unobservable. Numerical results are given
   to illustrate both the model and estimation procedure.

AB Under a consignment contract with revenue sharing, a supplier decides on
   the retail price and delivery quantity for his product, and retains
   ownership of the goods; for each item sold, the retailer deducts a
   percentage from the selling price and remits the balance to the
   supplier. In this paper we show that, under such a contract, both the
   overall channel performance and the performance of individual firms
   depend critically on demand price elasticity and on the retailer's share
   of channel cost. In particular, the (expected) channel profit loss,
   compared with that of a centralized system, increases with demand price
   elasticity and decreases with retailer's cost share, while the profit
   share extracted by the retailer decreases with price elasticity and
   increases with retailer's cost share. With an iso-price-elastic demand
   model, we show that the channel profit loss cannot exceed 26.4%, and
   that the retailer's profit share cannot be below 50%. When price
   elasticity is low, or when the retailer's cost share approaches 100%, or
   both, the retailer can extract nearly all the channel profit that is
   almost equal to the centralized channel profit.

AB In this paper, a risk-neutral manufacturer sells a single product to a
   risk-neutral retailer. The retailer chooses inventories ex ante and
   promotional effort ex post. If the wholesale price exceeds marginal
   production cost, the retailer orders fewer than the joint
   profit-maximizing inventories. If the manufacturer attempts to
   coordinate inventories by buying back unsold units, then the retailer's
   promotional incentives are dulled. Under very general assumptions on the
   form of the effort function, we show that buy-backs adversely affect
   supply chain profits, and higher buy-back prices imply lower profits.
   Also, while a buy-back alone cannot coordinate the channel, coupling
   buy-backs with promotional cost-sharing agreements (if effort cost is
   observable), offering unilateral markdown allowances ex post (if demand
   is observable but not verifiable), or placing additional constraints on
   the buy-back (if demand is observable and verifiable) does result in
   coordination. This problem is not limited to returns policies but is
   shown to hold for a much larger set of contracts. The results are quite
   robust (e.g., when the retailer chooses effort before observing demand),
   but coordinating contracts become more problematic if, for example, the
   retailer also stocks substitutes for the manufacturer's product. Other
   model extensions are also discussed.

AB A common theme in the studies of flexible supply contracts has been the
   producer's profit-maximization problem without regard to the suppliers'
   reactions. However, suppliers do react and protect their downside
   against producer's operating policies by revising their strategies in a
   manner consistent with their profit-maximization objectives. This fact
   motivates our work. Using a real-options (contingent claims) approach,
   we analyze and value supply contracts in a setting characterized by
   exchange rate uncertainty, supplier-switching options, order-quantity
   flexibility, profit sharing, and supplier reaction options. We also use
   basic diversification concepts, from portfolio theory, to analyze risk
   reduction in a unique framework. Given this setup, we explicitly model
   how flexibility can be mutually beneficial to both the producer and the
   suppliers. Using this model, we concurrently solve and examine the dual
   optimization problem for the suppliers and the producer. Our approach
   also endogenizes the extent and degree of profit sharing through the
   resulting optimal policies. We also analyze what induces the producer
   and the suppliers to accept flexibility in their contracts.

   Cross-training and agile workforce policies, we study simple models of
   serial production systems with flexible servers operating under a

   interrelated issues are: (a) how to decide which skill(s) are
   strategically most desirable for workers to gain, and (b) how to
   coordinate these workers to respond dynamically to congestion. We
   address these by considering two cross-training strategies: a
   straightforward capacity-balancing approach, which, we call cherry
   picking (CP), and an innovative overlapping zone strategy that we call
   skill chaining. Our comparison shows that skill-chaining strategies have
   the potential to be robust and efficient methods for implementing

AB This paper considers a multicomponent, multiproduct periodic-review
   assemble-to-order (ATO) system that uses an independent base-stock
   policy for inventory replenishment. Product demands in each period are
   integer-valued correlated random variables, with each product being
   assembled from multiple units of a subset of components. The system
   quotes a prespecified response time window for each product and receives
   a reward if the demand for that product is filled within its response
   time window. We formulate a two-stage stochastic integer program with
   recourse to determine the optimal base-stock policy and the optimal
   component allocation policy for the ATO system. We show that the
   component allocation problem is a general multidimensional knapsack
   problem (MDKP) and is NP-hard. We propose a simple, order-based
   component allocation rule and show that it can be solved in either
   polynomial or pseudopolynomial time. We also use the sample average
   approximation method to determine the optimal base-stock levels and
   compare it with two variations of the equal fractile heuristic.
   Intensive testing indicates that our solution method for each stage of
   the stochastic program is robust, effective, and that it significantly
   outperforms existing methods. Finally, we discuss several managerial
   implications of our findings.

   optimizing shelf-space allocation. It extends the model to address other
   requirements such as product groupings and nonlinear profit functions.
   Besides providing a network flow solution, we put forward a strategy
   that combines a strong local search with a metaheuristic approach to
   space allocation. This, strategy is flexible and efficient, as it can
   address both linear and nonlinear problems of realistic size while
   achieving, near-optimal solutions through easily implemented algorithms
   in reasonable timescales. It offers, retailers opportunities for more
   efficient and,profitable shelf management, as well as higher-quality

AB A major challenge in the creation of custom-designed products lies in
   the elicitation of customer needs. As customers are frequently unable to
   accurately articulate their needs, designers typically create one or
   several prototypes, which they then present to the customer. This
   process, which we call collaborative prototyping, allows both parties to
   anticipate the outcome of the design process. Prototypes have two
   advantages: They help the customer to evaluate the unknown customized
   product, and they guide both parties in the search for the ideal product
   specification. Collaborative prototyping involves two economic agents,
   with different information structures and different-and potentially
   conflicting-objective functions. This raises several interesting
   questions: how many prototypes should be built, who should pay for them,
   and how should they and the customized product be priced. We show that,
   depending on the design problem and the market characteristics, the
   designer should offer prototypes at a profit, at cost, or even for free.

AB The problem of designing, coordinating, and managing complex systems has
   been central to the management and organization literature. Recent
   writings have tended to offer modularity as at least a partial solution
   to this design problem. However, little attention has been paid to the
   problem of identifying what constitutes an appropriate modularization of
   a complex system. We develop a formal simulation model that allows us to
   carefully examine the dynamics of innovation and performance in complex
   systems. The model points to the trade-off between the destabilizing
   effects of overly refined modularization and the modest levels of search
   and a premature fixation on inferior designs that can result from
   excessive levels of integration. The analysis highlights an asymmetry in
   this trade-off, with excessively refined modules leading to cycling
   behavior and a lack of performance improvement. We discuss the
   implications of these arguments for product and organization design.

   innovation. Across the six cases, a six-stage reuse-for-innovation
   process was identified consisting of three major actions:
   reconceptualize the problem and approach, including deciding to search
   for others' ideas to reuse; search-and-evaluate others' ideas to reuse;
   and develop the selected idea. Findings include (1) the need for an
   insurmountable gap in performance to stimulate the decision to reuse
   others' knowledge; (2) the critical importance of an adapter to bridge
   the idea source and recipient; (3) three layers of search-and-evaluate
   activities in which the first layer of scanning to find ideas to reuse
   and the last layer of detailed analysis of ideas are bridged by a layer
   of brief evaluations of ideas assessing the presence (or absence) of
   targeted information about each idea; and (4) the differential use of
   metaknowledge about each idea to facilitate proceeding through each
   search-and-evaluate layer. In addition, reusers in the more (versus
   less) innovative cases redefined problems at the outset in
   nontraditional ways using analogies and extensions, rather than
   accepting the preexisting problem definition; used a substantially
   broader search strategy with a greater variety of search methods; and
   worked more closely with adapters during the latter stages of the reuse
   process.

AB A primary tool that consumers have for comparative shopping is the
   shopbot, which is short for shopping robot. These shopbots automatically
   search a large number of vendors for price and availability. Typically a
   shopbot searches a predefined set of vendors and reports all results,
   which can result in time-consuming searches that provide redundant or
   dominated alternatives. Our research demonstrates analytically how
   shopbot designs can be improved by developing a utility model of
   consumer purchasing behavior. This utility model considers the intrinsic
   value of the product and its attributes, the disutility from waiting,
   and the cognitive costs associated with evaluating the offers retrieved.
   We focus on the operational decisions made by the shopbot: which stores
   to search, how long to wait, and which offers to present to the user. To
   illustrate our model we calibrate the model to price and response time
   data collected at online bookstores over a six-month period. Using prior
   expectations about price and response time, we show how shopbots can
   substantially increase consumer utility by searching more intelligently
   and then selectively presenting offers.

   that a country is integrated with (segmented from) the world capital

   also show that although global industry risk is small, it can be priced
   for certain industries. Industries that are priced differently from

AB While every firm in a supply chain bears supply risk (the cost of
   insufficient supply), some firms may, even with wholesale price
   contracts, completely avoid inventory risk (the cost of unsold
   inventory). With a push contract there is a single wholesale price and
   the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season,
   bears all of the supply chain's inventory risk. A pull contract also has
   a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain's
   inventory risk because only the supplier holds inventory while the
   retailer replenishes as needed during the season. (Examples include
   Vendor Managed Inventory with consignment and drop shipping.) An
   advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price
   for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for
   replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts
   allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears
   the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears
   the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research
   studies how the allocation of inventory risk (via these three types of
   wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of
   the supply chain's profit to its maximum profit). It is found that the
   efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher
   than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull
   contracts. In other words, the literature has exaggerated the value of
   implementing coordinating contracts (i.e., contracts that achieve 100%
   efficiency, such as buy-backs or revenue sharing) because coordinating
   contracts are compared against an inappropriate benchmark (often just a
   push contract). Furthermore, if firms also consider advance-purchase
   discounts, which are also simple to administer, then the coordination of
   the supply chain and the arbitrary allocation of its profit is possible.
   Several limitations of advance-purchase discounts are discussed.

AB The importance of remanufacturing used products into new ones has been
   widely recognized in the literature and in practice. In this paper, we
   address the problem of choosing the appropriate reverse channel
   structure for the collection of used products from customers.
   Specifically, we consider a manufacturer who has three options for
   collecting such products: (1) she can collect them herself directly from
   the customers, (2) she can provide suitable incentives to an existing
   retailer (who already has a distribution channel) to induce the
   collection, or (3) she can subcontract the collection activity to a
   third party. Based on our observations in the industry, we model the
   three options described above as decentralized decision-making systems
   with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. When considering
   decentralized channels, we find that ceteris paribus, the agent, who is
   closer to the customer (i.e., the retailer), is the most effective
   undertaker of product collection activity for the manufacturer. In
   addition, we show that simple coordination mechanisms can be designed
   such that the collection effort of the retailer and the supply chain
   profits are attained at the same level as in a centrally coordinated
   system.

AB This paper considers the problem of determining the optimal ordering
   quantities of a purchased item where there are step changes in price,
   either up or down. Other costs incurred include ordering costs
   associated with each replenishment and holding costs related to capital
   tied up in inventory and physical stock holding. The net present value
   (NPV) principle is applied. Explicit expressions for the development of
   the optimal order quantities over time are presented. It is shown that
   three cases may be distinguished: (i) when the price change is very
   small, (ii) when an essential price increase occurs, and (iii) when
   there is an essential price decrease. Although the optimal last-order
   quantity before a price increase is similar in magnitude to what has
   been presented in other articles applying average cost approaches, in
   certain respects, this paper offers novel results contradictory to those
   suggested by other authors. Analysis shows that the average-cost model
   solutions are first-order approximations in the discount rate. Numerical
   evaluations of a range of price increases and times to the price
   increase suggest that, with certain important caveats, the average-cost
   formulae are likely to be acceptable for most practical situations for
   the infinite horizon situation.

AB The development of the information systems (IS) literature in Management
   Science during the past 50 years reflects the inception, growth, and
   maturation of several different research streams. The five research
   streams we identify incorporate different definitions of the managerial
   problems that relate to IS, the alternate theoretical perspectives and
   different methodological paradigms to study them, and the levels of the
   organization at which their primary results impact managerial practice.
   The decision support and design science research stream studies the
   application of computers in decision support, control, and managerial
   decision making. The value of information research stream reflects
   relationships established based on economic analysis of information as a
   commodity in the management of the firm. The human-computer systems
   design research stream emphasizes the cognitive basis for effective
   systems design. The IS organization and strategy research stream focuses
   the level of analysis on the locus of value of the IS investment instead
   of on the perceptions of a system or its user. The economics of
   information systems and technology research stream emphasizes the
   application of theoretical perspectives and methods from analytical and
   empirical economics to managerial problems involving IS and information
   technologies (IT). Based on a discussion of these streams, we evaluate
   the IS literature's core contributions to theoretical and managerial
   knowledge, and make some predictions about the road that lies ahead for
   IS researchers.

AB This paper examines search across competing e-commerce sites. By
   analyzing panel data from over 10 000 Internet households and three
   commodity-like products (books, compact discs (CDs), and air travel
   services), we show that the amount of online search is actually quite
   limited. On average, households visit only 1.2 book sites, 1.3 CD sites,
   and 1.8 travel sites during a typical active month in each category.
   Using probabilistic models, we characterize search behavior at the
   individual level in terms of (1) depth of search, (2) dynamics of
   search, and (3) activity of search.
   We model an individual's tendency to search as a logarithmic process,
   finding that shoppers search across very few sites in a given shopping
   month. We extend the logarithmic model of search to allow for
   time-varying dynamics that may cause the consumer to evolve and,
   perhaps, learn to search over time. We find that for two of the three
   product categories studied, search propensity does not change from month
   to month. However, in the third product category we find mild evidence
   of time-varying dynamics, where search decreases over time from already
   low levels. Finally, we model the level of a household's shopping
   activity and integrate it into our model of search. The results suggest
   that more-active online shoppers tend also to search across more sites.
   This consumer characteristic largely drives the dynamics of search that
   can easily be mistaken as increases from experience at the individual
   level.

AB Long-distance telephone companies in the United States pay access fees
   to local telephone companies to transport calls that originate and
   terminate on their networks. These charges form the largest portion of
   the cost of providing long-distance service. Recent changes in the
   structure of access rates, which were mandated by the Federal
   Communications Commission (FCC), have created opportunities for
   long-distance companies to better manage access costs. In this paper, we
   develop an optimization-based approach to the economic design of access
   networks. Our novel solution approach combines stochastic aspects of the
   problem with a challenging discrete facility location problem in a
   three-phase algorithm. Computational results indicate a potential cost
   savings of hundreds of millions of dollars annually for long-distance
   companies.

AB T his paper develops a model of conversion behavior (i.e., converting
   store visits into purchases) that predicts each customer's probability
   of purchasing based on an observed history of visits and purchases. We
   offer an individual-level probability model that allows for different
   forms of customer heterogeneity in a very flexible manner. Specifically,
   we decompose an individual's conversion behavior into two components:
   one for accumulating visit effects and another for purchasing threshold
   effects. Each component is allowed to vary across households as well as
   over time. Visit effects capture the notion that store visits can play
   different roles in the purchasing process. For example, some visits are
   motivated by planned purchases, while others are associated with hedonic
   browsing (akin to window shopping); our model is able to accommodate
   these (and several other) types of visit-purchase relationships in a
   logical, parsimonious manner. The purchasing threshold captures the
   psychological resistance to online purchasing that may grow or shrink as
   a customer gains more experience with the purchasing process at a given
   website. We test different versions of the model that vary in the
   complexity of these two key components and also compare our general
   framework with popular alternatives such as logistic regression. We find
   that the proposed model offers excellent statistical properties,
   including its performance in a holdout validation sample, and also
   provides useful managerial diagnostics about the patterns underlying
   online buyer behavior.

   appear to aggregate information efficiently to predict events such as
   election outcomes. Yet, in theory, perfect information aggregation is
   impossible. Further, the markets are populated by a nonrepresentative
   sample of mistake-prone and biased traders. That is, traders are prone
   to the behavioral anomalies predicted by behavioral finance. How can
   this be reconciled with market efficiency? Here, we take a first step by
   analyzing the behavior of two self-selected types of traders. Dramatic
   differences in mistake rates across traders can help us answer the
   question. Market-making traders who set prices are less mistake prone
   and appear to be more rational than price-taking traders. This
   highlights an important feature of markets: marginal (in this case,
   market making), not average, traders set prices. This can drive the
   efficiency of market prices in spite of large numbers of traders who
   display patently suboptimal behavior.

   of information, know-how, and feedback with customers, organizational

   value of external knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more
   structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group is one in which
   the members, by virtue of their different organizational affiliations,
   roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique sources of
   knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse
   work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance will
   improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique
   external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500
   telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity as member
   differences in geographic locations, functional assignments, reporting
   managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate database
   records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group member
   surveys and performance was assessed using senior executive ratings.
   Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more
   strongly associated with performance when work groups were more
   structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around the
   integration of work groups and social networks are addressed.

   customers. We describe an integer programming approach for a class of
   such problems, where solutions have to obey a number of constraints
   related to workload balancing, shift compatibility and distribution of
   days off. The formulation of the constraints is general and can be
   extended to different personnel management problems where staff members
   must cover shifts, and management must assign a fixed number of days off
   per week. The model maximizes staff satisfaction, expressed by positive
   weights for pairs of shifts in consecutive days. We consider the
   associated polytope and study its structure, determining some classes of
   inequalities that are facet inducing for special subproblems and other
   valid classes. We also identify a particular subproblem whose solution
   can be used to determine strong cuts for the complete problem. In
   addition, we design special branching rules that break the symmetries
   that arise in the solution space and have a large impact in the
   efficiency of the method. The validity of this approach has been
   ascertained by extensive computational tests; moreover, the operations

AB This paper analyzes the relationship between investment in information
   and communication technologies (ICT), non-ICT investment, labor
   productivity, and workplace reorganization. Firms are assumed to
   reorganize workplaces if the productivity gains arising from workplace
   reorganization exceed the associated reorganization costs. Two different
   types of organizational change are considered: enhancement group work
   and flattening of hierarchies. Empirical evidence is provided for a
   sample of 411 firms from the German business-related services sector.
   We develop and estimate a model for labor productivity and firms'
   decision to reorganize workplaces that allows workplace reorganization
   to affect any parameter of the labor productivity equation. Our general
   and flexible methodology allows us to properly take account of strategic
   complementarities between the input factors and workplace
   reorganization. The estimation results show that changes in human
   resources practices do not significantly affect firms' output
   elasticities with respect to ICT, non-ICT capital, and labor, although
   most of the point estimates of the individual output elasticities and of
   the control variables for observable firm heterogeneity are larger if
   workplace reorganization is realized. We therefore apply the Kernel
   density-estimation technique and demonstrate that for firms with
   organizational change, the entire labor productivity distribution shifts
   significantly out to the right if workplace reorganization takes place,
   indicating that workplace reorganization induces an increase in labor
   productivity that is attributable to complementarities between the
   various input factors and workplace reorganization. By contrast, firms
   without organizational change would not have realized significant
   productivity gains if they had reorganized workplaces.

AB The main goal of this paper is to describe a new multistage Monte Carlo
   (MMC) simulation method for solving influence diagrams using local
   computation. Global methods have been proposed by others that sample
   from the joint probability distribution of all the variables in the
   influence diagram. However, for influence diagrams having many
   variables, the state space of all variables grows exponentially, and the
   sample sizes required for good estimates may be too large to be
   practical. In this paper, we develop a MMC method, which samples only a
   small set of chance variables for each decision node in the influence
   diagram. MMC is akin to methods developed for exact solution of
   influence diagrams in that we limit the number of chance variables
   sampled at any time. Because influence diagrams model each chance
   variable with a conditional probability distribution, the MMC method
   lends itself well to influence diagram representations.

AB Commonality strategies assemble different products from at least one
   common component and one other product-specific component. The
   distinguishing feature of commonality, i.e., the presence of dedicated
   components to be assembled with a common component, is shown to be
   mathematically inconsequential in the sense that the unified commonality
   problem for two products can be reduced to an equivalent substitution
   flexibility problem without those dedicated components. This significant
   simplification provides the first general, closed-form condition for
   commonality adoption and identifies its value drivers. Commonality is
   optimal even for perfectly correlated demands if products have
   sufficiently different margins. This introduces the
   "revenue-maximization option" of commonality as a second benefit that is
   independent of the traditional risk-pooling benefit. "Pure commonality"
   strategies are never optimal unless complexity costs are introduced.
   Dual sourcing, externalities, and operational hedging features of
   commonality are discussed.

AB Information integration efforts between manufacturers and retailers, in
   the form of information sharing, synchronized replenishment, and
   collaborative product design and development, have been cited as major
   means to improve supply chain performance. This paper develops a
   conceptual framework that relates information-integration initiatives to
   manufacturer profitability. The framework allows such initiatives to
   impact inventory management and revenue-enhancing measures that, in
   turn, increase manufacturer profit margins, or affect profit margins
   directly. Through an extensive survey in the food and consumer packaged
   goods industry, we empirically examine this framework. The analysis
   reveals that the various integration techniques are differentially
   associated with manufacturer performance. Collaborative planning on
   replenishment, in the form of vendor-managed inventory (VMI), is
   directly and positively related to manufacturer margins, while
   collaboration on new products and services is positively related to
   intermediate performance measures. Specifically, this latter form of
   collaboration allows the manufacturer to charge higher wholesale prices
   and, interestingly, is associated with lower retailer, and consequently
   manufacturer, stockouts. In contrast, collaboration on the handling of
   excess and defective retailer inventory (i.e., reverse logistics)
   results in higher manufacturer stock-out levels, on average. Solely
   sharing information on either inventory levels or customer needs is
   associated with higher manufacturer performance measures up to a certain
   point; sharing this information is prevalent among manufacturers that
   achieve industry-average profitability relative to those that achieve
   below industry-average profitability. The paper explains these results
   in the context of the conceptual framework developed and discusses the
   managerial implications for effective coordination between supply chain
   partners.

AB Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is emerging as a significant development
   in the recent trend towards collaboration and information sharing in
   supply chain management. Transfer of inventory monitoring and other
   overhead costs to manufacturers and continuous replenishment of retailer
   inventory are commonly cited as potential benefits that VMI offers to
   retailers. We provide a new explanation in this paper for why retailers
   might be interested in VMI. We show that VMl intensifies the competition
   between manufacturers of competing brands and that the increased
   competition benefits a retailer that stocks these brands. Competition
   arises because of brand substitution; that is, some consumers may switch
   to another brand if their "preferred" brand is out of stock. The
   manufacturer whose brand is out of stock thus risks losing sales from
   those consumers who buy the competing brand. Consequently, each
   manufacturer has an incentive to keep a higher stock of its own brand,
   not only to satisfy the demand from its customers, but also the
   spillover demand that arises if a competing brand goes out of stock.
   When the retailer makes the stocking-level decisions, the competition is
   mitigated by the pooling of demands at the retailer. VMl restores the
   competition between the manufacturers and benefits the retailer.

AB Using a simulated supply chain experiment based on the well-known "beer
   game," we examine how changes in order and delivery cycles, availability
   of shared point-of-sale (POS) information, and the pattern of customer
   demand affect supply chain efficiency. We find that speeding up cycle
   time is beneficial, but the sharing of POS information is not
   necessarily so. Whether or not the sharing of POS information is
   beneficial depends on the nature of the demand pattern represented by
   the POS information. If the demand pattern conveys continual change in
   ultimate downstream customer demand (as does an S-shaped demand
   pattern), the POS information can distract the upstream decision maker
   from what is perhaps more immediately relevant information, orders
   placed by the proximate downstream agent and the supply line.

AB Consider a retailer who sells perishable seasonal products with
   uncertain demand. Due to the short sales season and long replenishment
   lead times associated with such products, the retailer is unable to
   update demand forecasts by using actual sales data generated from the
   early part of the season and to respond by replenishing stocks during
   the season. To overcome this limitation, we examine the case in which
   the retailer develops a program called the "advance booking discount"
   (ABD) program that entices customers to commit to their orders at a
   discount price prior to the selling season. The time between placement
   and fulfillment of these precommitted orders provides an opportunity for
   the retailer to update demand forecasts by utilizing information
   generated from the precommitted orders and to respond by placing a
   cost-effective order at the beginning of the selling season. In this
   paper, we evaluate the benefits of the ABD program and characterize the
   optimal discount price that maximizes the retailer's expected profit.

AB Service firms have increasingly been competing for market share on the
   basis of delivery time. Many firms now choose to set customer
   expectation by announcing their maximal delivery time. Customers will be
   satisfied if their perceived delivery times are shorter than their
   expectations. This gap model of service quality is used in this paper to
   study how a firm might choose a delivery-time commitment to influence
   its customer expectation, and delivery quality in order to maximize its
   market share. A market share model is developed to capture (1) the
   impact of delivery-time commitment and delivery quality on the firm's
   market share and (2) the impact of the firm's market share and process
   variability on delivery quality when there is a congestion effect. We
   show that the choice of the delivery-time commitment requires a proper
   balance between the level of service capacity and customer sensitivities
   to delivery-time expectation and delivery quality. We prove the
   existence of Nash equilibria in a duopolistic competition, and show that
   this delivery-time commitment game is analogous to a Prisoners' Dilemma.

AB Researchers and managers broadly agree that coordination and harmony
   between manufacturing and marketing improve firm performance by
   eliminating suboptimal practices within the firm. In this paper, we
   present a contrasting view of the manufacturing-marketing interface. We
   model a duopoly in which the firms compete on price and quality
   dimensions. The manufacturing and marketing managers within each firm
   are presented with conflicting incentives focused on cost minimization
   and revenue maximization, respectively. These managers bargain with each
   other before arriving-at compromise decisions regarding price and
   quality. While frequently encountered in practice, this
   "conflicting-objectives puzzle" is surprising because one expects that
   centralized coordination by the owners of the firm towards profit
   maximization would lead to higher profits. In this paper, we resolve the
   conflicting-objectives puzzle and demonstrate that, surprisingly, the
   firm's resulting profits in this setting of conflict can be higher than
   those obtained when the decisions of the managers are perfectly
   coordinated. We also analyze the equilibrium in incentive plans when the
   owners can choose between compromise and perfect coordination. Our
   results offer a new interpretation of manufacturing-marketing conflict
   as a strategic tool that can enhance firm profits.

AB Rewarding customers with own products or services has become an
   increasingly popular practice across a spectrum of industries such as
   airlines, hotels, and telecommunication. In these service industries,
   firms face demand uncertainty and strict short-term capacity constraint.
   When the market demand is low, firms hold excess capacities that would
   lead to intense price competition. In this paper we study the adoption
   and design of reward programs in the context of capacity management. We
   demonstrate that it is optimal for firms to offer capacity rewards when
   the market demand varies from one period to the other. By offering the
   reward programs, firms can effectively reduce available capacities when
   the market demand is low, and hence credibly show their unwillingness to
   undersell. Such a commitment can encourage their competitors to set
   their prices high. When firms provide reward programs, if a firm sets a
   higher price than the other and sells less today, in the future the firm
   can benefit from the other firm's larger reduction in available capacity
   through rewards. Thus, reward programs also provide additional
   incentives for firms to set higher current prices. Finally, since reward
   programs can add flexibility in adjusting the available capacities to
   the market demand, firms increase the size of regular capacities with
   reward programs.

AB Matching production with sales potential is essential for survival in
   volatile markets. Manufacturing and marketing managers compete for
   staff, space, cash, and other assets as they struggle both to determine
   what and how many products ought to be produced, and to actually produce
   them. We develop an analytical framework to answer one simple question,
   "How much marketing research should a firm do when it takes resources
   away from manufacturing the goods that generate revenue?" To understand
   the costs and benefits of marketing research, we account for the lost
   opportunities to produce these goods. Some analytical findings are
   striking: firms without initial knowledge of their potential customers
   should allocate one-third of the firm's resources to marketing research.
   The model suggests a host of issues to be more deeply studied by
   management scientists.

AB We study how industry clockspeed, internal firm factors, such as product
   development, production, and inventory costs, and competitive factors
   determine a firm's optimal new-product introduction timing and
   product-quality decisions. We explicitly model market demand
   uncertainty, a firm's internal cost structure, and competition, using an
   infinite-horizon Markov decision process. Based on a large-scale
   numerical analysis, we find that more frequent new-product introductions
   are optimal under faster clockspeed conditions. In addition, we find
   that a firm's optimal product-quality decision is governed by a firm's
   relative costs of introducing new products with incremental versus more
   substantial improvements. We show that a time-pacing product
   introduction strategy results in a production policy with a simple
   base-stock form and performs well relative to the optimal policy Our
   results thus provide analytical support for the managerial belief that
   industry clockspeed and time to market are closely related.

   and romantic partners, can become unavailable if sufficient effort is
   not invested in them (taking classes, sending flowers). The question
   asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way
   people value such options. In four experiments using "door games," we
   demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision
   makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open,
   even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This
   general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the
   outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The
   last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying
   the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather
   than a desire for flexibility.

AB Expert judgment elicitation is often required in probabilistic decision
   making and the evaluation of risk. One measure of the quality of
   probability distributions given by experts is calibration-the
   faithfulness of the probabilities in an empirically verifiable sense. A
   method of measuring calibration for continuous probability distributions
   is presented here. A discussion of the impact of using linear rules for
   combining such judgments is given and an empirical demonstration is
   given using data collected from experts participating in a large-scale
   risk study It is shown by theoretical argument that combining
   well-calibrated distributions of individual experts using linear rules
   can only result in reducing calibration. In contrast, it is
   demonstrated, both by example and empirically, that an equally weighted
   linear combination of experts who tend to be "overconfident" can produce
   distributions that are better calibrated than the experts' individual
   distributions. Using data from training exercises, it is shown that the
   improvement in calibration is rapid as the number of experts is
   increased from one to five or six, but there is only modest improvement
   from increasing the number of experts beyond that point.

AB This paper develops a new likelihood-based method for the simultaneous
   estimation of structural demand-and-supply models for markets with
   differentiated products. We specify an individual-level discrete-choice
   model of demand and derive the supply side assuming manufacturers
   compete in prices. The proposed estimation method considers price
   endogeneity through simultaneous estimation of demand and supply, allows
   for consumer heterogeneity; and incorporates a pricing rule consistent
   with economic theory.
   The basic idea behind the proposed estimation procedure is to simulate
   prices and choice probabilities by solving for the market equilibrium.
   By repeating this many times, we obtain an empirical distribution of
   equilibrium prices and probabilities. The empirical distribution is then
   smoothed and used in a likelihood procedure to estimate the parameters
   of the model. The advantage of this method is that it avoids the need to
   perform a transformation of variables. If the tastes of consumers are
   independent across market periods, our approach yields maximum
   likelihood estimates; otherwise, it yields consistent but not fully
   efficient partial likelihood estimates.

   questions, we conduct a large-scale econometric investigation of the
   effects of price promotions on manufacturer revenues, retailer revenues,
   and total profits (margins).
   A first major finding is that a price promotion typically does not have
   permanent monetary effects for either party. Second, price promotions
   have a predominantly positive impact on manufacturer revenues, but their
   effects on retailer revenues are mixed. Moreover, retailer category
   margins are typically reduced by price promotions. Even when accounting
   for cross-category and store-traffic effects, we still find evidence
   that price promotions are typically not beneficial to the retailer.
   Third, our results indicate that manufacturer revenue elasticities are
   higher for promotions of small-share brands, for frequently promoted
   brands and for national brands in impulse product categories with a low
   degree of brand proliferation and low private-label shares. Retailer
   revenue elasticities are higher for brands with frequent and shallow
   promotions, for impulse products, and in categories with a low degree of
   brand proliferation. Finally, retailer margin elasticities are higher
   for promotions of small-share brands and for brands with infrequent and
   shallow promotions. We discuss the managerial implications of our
   results for both manufacturers and retailers.

AB In some retail contexts, stocking large quantities of inventory may not
   only improve service levels, but can also stimulate demand. For products
   having demand rates that increase with inventory levels, we analyze the
   effect of stocking decisions on firm profitability to develop managerial
   insights regarding the structure of the optimal inventory policy, and to
   understand how this policy differs from traditional approaches. When
   inventories stimulate demand, iteratively applying the standard economic
   order quantity (EOQ) model-by setting the demand rate parameter equal to
   the observed average demand rate in prior cycles-yields an equilibrium
   order quantity that is robust to demand parameter misestimation, but is
   suboptimal. The profit-maximizing policy orders larger quantities, and
   can replenish inventory even before on-hand stock fully depletes. Using
   an extension of a standard inventory-dependent demand model from the
   literature, we first provide a convenient characterization of products
   that require early replenishment. We demonstrate that the optimal cycle
   time is largely governed by the conventional trade-off between ordering
   and holding costs, whereas the reorder point relates to a
   promotions-oriented cost-benefit perspective. We show that the optimal
   policy yields significantly higher profits than cost-based inventory
   policies, underscoring the importance of profit-driven inventory
   management.

AB This paper studies how transshipments affect manufacturers and
   retailers, considering both exogenous and endogenous wholesale prices.,
   For a distribution system where a single manufacturer sells to multiple
   identical-cost retailers, we consider both the manufacturer being a
   price taker and the manufacturer being a price setter in a single-period
   setup under multivariate normal demand distribution. In the case of the
   manufacturer being a price taker, we provide several analytical results
   regarding the effects of key parameters on order quantities and profits.
   In the case of the manufacturer being a price setter, we characterize
   the Stackelberg game that arises, and provide several insights into how
   the game dynamics are affected by transshipments. Specifically, we find
   that risk pooling makes retailers' order quantities less sensitive to
   the wholesale price set by the manufacturer; hence, in general, the
   manufacturer benefits from retailers' transshipments by charging a
   higher wholesale price, while retailers are often worse off. The paper
   captures the effect of demand correlation and the effect of the number
   of retailers throughout, and it illustrates the findings by a numerical
   example. We also provide an interactive Web page for numerical
   experiments.

AB Resource flexibility refers to the ability to dynamically reallocate
   units of resource from one stage of a production process to another in
   response to shifting bottlenecks. Recent research has demonstrated that
   substantial improvements in operational performance can be realized in
   both serial- and parallel-machine production environments through the
   effective utilization of resource flexibility. In these contexts the
   resource was assumed to exhibit complete flexibility This research
   explores the extent to which the operational benefits associated with
   resource flexibility can be achieved in a flow shop envirornment using a
   partially flexible resource. Focusing on labor flexibility, we propose
   corresponding metrics for partial flexibility and formulate a model for
   flow shop scheduling with partial resource flexibility. On the basis of
   computational experiments, we explore properties pertaining to the
   relative amounts as well as the allocation of partial resource
   flexibility as it is distributed across the workforce. The conclusions
   drawn from this research provide significant insight into the management
   of flow shops with a workforce that is crosstrained to achieve partial
   flexibility. Moreover, we extend the principles developed by Jordan and
   Graves (1995) for partially flexible manufacturing plants to the flow
   shop scheduling environment, and we link these principles in a novel way
   to recent research on self-buffering flow lines.

AB he abundance of transaction data available on the Internet tends to make
   information more transparent in electronic marketplaces. In such a
   transparent environment, it becomes easier for suppliers to obtain
   information that may allow them to infer their rivals' costs. Is this
   good news or bad news? In this study, we focus on the informational
   effects of business-to-business (B2B) exchanges, and explore firms'
   incentives to join a B2B exchange that provides an online platform for
   information transmission. We then study the equilibria by developing a
   game-theoretic model under asymmetric information. We examine whether
   the incentives to join a B2B exchange would be different under different
   competition modes (quantity and price), different information
   structures, and by varying the nature of the products (substitutes and
   complements). Our results challenge the "information transparency
   hypothesis" (i.e., open sharing of information in electronic markets is
   beneficial to all participating firms). In contrast to the popular
   belief, we show that information transparency could be a double-edged
   sword. The individual rationality of participation in the online
   exchange reflects the tradeoff between information transparency and data
   confidentiality. This may have important implications for the
   microstructure design (e.g., data access rules) of B2B electronic
   marketplaces.

AB Prior research suggests that brand may influence consumer preference for
   differentiated products. However, the extant literature does not measure
   how brand value affects product similarity and consumer choice. This
   paper examines demand response to the proliferation of personal
   computers (PCs). Using both the central processing unit (CPU) and brand
   as segmentation variables, I construct a two-level nested generalized
   extreme value (GEV) discrete choice model to estimate the brand values
   and product similarities of a set of PC vendors. With these estimates, I
   infer the relative efficacy of product variety for firms which possess
   different degrees of brand values. My results suggest that consumers
   treat PCs from the same firm as close substitutes, and the proximity of
   the PCs correlates positively with the firms' brand values. This finding
   suggests that there are decreasing demand returns to product variety for
   branded multiproduct firms. I discuss a few possible drivers of brand
   value and explore the significance of product line extension in building
   long-term brand reputation.

   to lock in a portion of the customer demand and use this demand

AB Airlines are continually faced with the challenge of efficient
   utilization of their cockpit crew resources. In addition to regular
   flying crews, airlines maintain significant reserve staffing levels to
   meet contractual obligations and provide smooth daily operations. Most
   airlines also depend on voluntary and involuntary flying by regular
   crews to cover trips that fall out of work schedules due to conflicts
   and disruptions (open time trips). These open time trips, combined with
   expected levels of voluntary and involuntary flying, affect reserve
   staffing levels; airlines must plan crew staffing in advance to meet
   resulting training and new-hire requirements. Inefficient operational
   reserve utilization can further affect long-range crew staffing,
   resulting in higher training and new-hire costs. The proposed
   optimization strategy to estimate long-range crew staffing combines
   operational reserve utilization and premium operational costs due to
   voluntary and involuntary flying with long-range business needs.

   formulate a model of capacity expansion for uncertain exponential demand
   growth and deterministic expansion lead times when there is an
   obligation to provide a specified level of service. The service level,

   installed capacity, is guaranteed by timing each expansion to begin when
   demand reaches a fixed proportion of the capacity position. Under this
   timing rule, the optimal facilities to install can be determined by
   solving an equivalent deterministic problem without lead times.
   Numerical results show the effects of the demand parameters and

   expansion size is explored for the case when continuous facility sizes
   are available with economies of scale.

AB The pooling problem, which is fundamental to the petroleum industry,
   describes a situation in which products possessing different attribute
   qualities are mixed in a series of pools in such a way that the
   attribute qualities of the blended products of the end pools must
   satisfy given requirements. It is well known that the pooling problem
   can be modeled through bilinear and nonconvex quadratic programming. In
   this paper, we investigate how best to apply a new branch-and-cut
   quadratic programming algorithm to solve the pooling problem. To this
   effect, we consider two standard models: One is based primarily on flow
   variables, and the other relies on the proportion. of flows entering
   pools. A hybrid of these two models is proposed for general pooling
   problems. Comparison of the computational properties of flow and
   proportion models is made on several problem instances taken from the
   literature. Moreover, a simple alternating procedure and a variable
   neighborhood search heuristic are developed to solve large instances and
   compared with the well-known method of successive linear programming.
   Solution of difficult test problems from the literature is substantially

AB Outcome prediction based on historical data has been of practical and
   theoretical interest in many disciplines. A common type of outcome
   prediction is binary or discrete outcome prediction, as found in medical
   diagnosis and firm bankruptcy prediction. The prediction problem studied
   in this paper is outcome time prediction, or prognosis. Prognosis in
   medicine refers to a prediction of probable outcome of a disease for a
   patient. Patient data used as the basis for disease prognosis are
   usually censored because some of the patients have not experienced the
   outcome of the disease at the time of prognosis. A
   mathematical-programming approach, called isotonic prediction, is
   developed for the purpose of such prognosis tasks. The proposed
   technique is different from well-known statistical survival analysis
   methods, such as Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation and Cox's
   regression, in that it predicts individual patients' survival time
   frame. Two medical applications are presented to show the applicability
   of the proposed isotonic prediction technique.

   approach was proposed to provide a decision maker with an effective and
   easy-to-use method to summarize the effects of simultaneous and
   independent changes in selected parameters. In particular, for
   variations of the objective function coefficients, the approach gives a
   maximum-tolerance percentage within which selected coefficients may vary
   from their estimated values (within a priori limits) while still
   retaining the same optimal basic feasible solution. Although an optimal
   solution may cease being optimal for variations beyond the
   maximum-tolerance percentage, it may still be close to optimal. Herein
   we characterize the potential loss of optimality for variations beyond
   the maximum-tolerance percentage as a maximum-regret function. We

   used, perhaps unknowingly, in the design or manufacture of their
   products? This paper examines the conditions under which firms expand
   their own portfolios of patents in response to potential hold-up
   problems in markets for technology Combining insights from transactions
   cost theory with recent scholarship on intellectual property and its
   exchange, I predict firms will patent more aggressively than otherwise
   expected when markets for technology are highly fragmented (i.e.,
   ownership rights to external technologies are widely distributed); this
   effect should be more pronounced for firms with large investments in
   technology-specific assets and under a strong legal-appropriability
   regime. Although these characteristics of firms and their external
   environments have been highlighted in the theoretical literature, prior
   research has not explored the extent to which such factors interact to
   shape the patenting behavior of firms. To empirically test these
   hypotheses, I develop a citations-based "fragmentation index" and
   estimate the determinants of patenting for 67 U.S. semiconductor firms
   between 1980 and 1994. Accumulating exclusionary rights of their own may
   enable firms to safeguard. their investments in new technologies while
   foregoing some of the costs and delays associated with ex ante
   contracting.

AB Much of the knowledge management (KM) literature focuses on ways to
   increase the volume of knowledge available to employees, ensure its

   limited to the extent that they do not address the demand for knowledge
   within,organizations. This paper takes a novel approach to understanding
   how access to others' knowledge produces benefits by studying the extent
   to which individuals intentionally access each other's expertise,
   experience, insights, and opinions, which we term knowledge sourcing. A
   general model of knowledge sourcing, including contextual and
   dispositional antecedents and learning outcomes, is proposed and
   validated using survey data from a global organization. Knowledge
   sourcing-explains a significant proportion of individuals' learning
   outcomes, but the strength of this effect is moderated both by the
   strength of individuals' learning orientations and the degree to which
   they find their jobs to be intellectually demanding. For researchers,
   this study extends existing knowledge by proposing, testing, and

AB his paper explores the relationship between wages and the scientific
   orientation of R&D organizations. Firms that adopt a science-oriented
   research approach (i.e., "science") allow their researchers to pursue
   and publish an individual research agenda. The adoption of science may
   be associated with a "taste" for science on the part of researchers (a
   preference effect) and/or as a "ticket of admission" to gain earlier
   access to scientific discoveries with commercial application (a
   productivity effect). These two effects differ in their impact on wages.
   Whereas the preference effect contributes to a negative compensating
   differential, the productivity effect may result in rent sharing.
   However, because science may be adopted by firms employing
   higher-quality researchers, cross-sectional evaluations of wages and
   science may be biased by unobserved heterogeneity. To overcome this
   bias, this paper introduces a novel empirical approach. Specifically,
   prior to accepting a given job, many scientists receive multiple job
   offers, allowing for the calculation of the wage-science relationship
   and controlling for differences in salary levels offered to individual
   researchers. Using a dataset composed of multiple job offers to
   postdoctoral biologists, the results suggest a negative relationship
   between wages and science. These findings are robust to restricting the
   sample to nonacademic job offers, but the findings depend critically on
   the inclusion of researcher fixed effects. Conditional on perceived
   ability, scientists do indeed pay to be scientists.

AB This paper studies alternative price-service mechanisms for a provider
   that serves customers whose delay cost depends on their service
   valuations. We propose a generalized delay cost structure that augments
   the standard additive model with a multiplicative component, capturing
   the interdependence between delay cost and values. We derive and compare
   the revenue-maximizing and socially optimal equilibria under uniform
   pricing, preemptive, and nonpreemptive priority auctions with an
   admission price. We find that the delay cost structure has a paramount
   effect on system behavior. The classical result that the
   revenue-maximizing admission price is higher and the utilization lower
   than is socially optimal can be reversed under our generalized
   structure, and we identify the conditions driving this reversal under
   each mechanism. We show that the conditional bid equilibria are unique
   and induce the socially optimal allocations. The auctions yield gains in
   system net value and provider profit over uniform pricing, which are
   dramatically larger for the preemptive mechanism. Both auctions perform
   better under multiplicative compared to additive delay costs. The
   highest-value customers always gain under the preemptive, but may lose
   under the nonpreemptive auction. The lowest-value customers always gain
   in either auction.

   minimum cross-entropy tilting parameter for a small buffer level; next,
   we use this as a starting value for the estimation of the optimal
   tilting parameter for the actual (large) buffer level. Finally, the
   tilting parameter just found is used to estimate the overflow
   probability of interest. We study various properties of the method in
   more detail for the M/M/1 queue and conjecture that similar properties
   also hold for quite general queueing networks. Numerical results support
   this conjecture and demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm.

   differences may be very likely even if there are no a priori differences
   among firms. As a result of the phenomenon of long leads in random
   walks, even a random resource accumulation process is likely to produce
   persistent resource heterogeneity and sustained interfirm profitability
   differences. A Cournot model in which costs follow a random walk shows
   that such a process could produce evidence of substantial persistence of
   profitability The results suggest that persistent profitability does not
   necessarily provide strong evidence for systematic a priori differences

   the right time to make an IPO?" and "How should operational and
   financial decisions be coordinated to increase the likelihood of a
   successful IPO?" Financial and operational decisions in this problem are
   linked because adequate financial capital is crucial for operational
   decisions to be feasible and operational decisions affect the firm's
   access to financial resources. The IPO event is treated as a stopping
   time in an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process. Unlike
   traditional stopping-time models, at every stage the model includes
   other decisions such as production, sales, and loan size. The results
   include (1) characterization of an optimal capacity-expansion policy,
   (2) sufficient conditions for a monotone threshold rule to yield an
   optimal IPO decision, and (3) algorithmic implications of results in (1)

AB While the goal of OR/MS is to aid decision makers, implementation of
   published models occurs less frequently than one might hope. However,
   one area that has been significantly impacted by management science is
   emergency response systems. Dozens of papers on emergency service
   management appeared in the OR/MS literature in the 1970s alone, many of
   which were published in Management Science. Three of these papers won
   major prizes. More importantly, many of these papers led to the
   implementation of substantially new policies and practices, particularly
   in policing and firefighting. Much of this work originated in New York
   City, though many other cities subsequently adopted the resulting models
   and strategies. In this paper, we look at the context, content, and
   nature of the research and the factors that led to these early
   implementation successes. We then track the extent to which these
   original models are still affecting decision making in emergency
   response systems. We also examine the pace of development of new OR/MS
   models and applications in the area. Finally, we look at issues in
   emergency responsiveness that have emerged recently as a result of the
   national focus on terrorism and discuss the potential for future OR/MS
   modeling and application.

   policy makers, can affect the choice between incentives to encourage
   conversion to a cleaner technology. By relating different conditions of
   firms' plant and equipment to production costs, extent of environmental
   damage, and cost of conversion to a cleaner technology, we show when a
   perfectly discriminating incentive to encourage conversion is not
   feasible. In addition, we show that firms with plant and equipment in
   better condition will convert their technology to mitigate their
   environmental damage, and firms with plant and equipment in poorer
   condition will not. This and a series of additional results lead to
   conditions under which an administratively simple uniform lump-sum
   incentive to switch to cleaner technology is preferable to one based on
   output. These results and conditions extend to cases where there are
   network externalities in conversion, and where there is strategic timing
   in firms' choice of when to convert.

AB Recent reports have raised serious concerns about the rapid declines of
   historically productive marine fishery resources and the degradation of
   essential fish habitats. This global crisis has spurred development of
   innovative management strategies to rebuild depleted fisheries and
   marine ecosystems. One highly touted strategy involves the design and
   creation of marine reserves (areas off limits to extractive uses) to
   rebuild fisheries and conserve marine biodiversity. In this paper, we
   propose an integrated sequence of methodologies that provides an
   objective, quantitative framework for the design of marine reserves in
   spatially heterogeneous coastal ocean environments.
   The marine reserve designs proposed here satisfy the multiple,
   often-conflicting criteria of disparate resource user groups. This
   research is the first attempt to explicitly explore the trade-off
   between the conservation goals of fishery management and coral reef
   protection and the consumptive interests of commercial and recreational
   fishing fleets. The spatial distribution and size abundance of reef fish
   stocks throughout the Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem were estimated
   from a database consisting of more than 18,000 visual samples taken from
   1979 to 2002. These distributions of multispecies abundance and biomass,
   in conjunction with a geographic database of coral reef habitats, are
   used to demonstrate an integer goal programming methodology for the
   design of networks of marine reserves, called plans. Once multiple plans
   are proposed, a simulation model is used to assess the effects of
   reserve size and shape on select Florida Keys reef fish populations
   under dynamic spatial and temporal conditions.

AB Most business-to-business (B2B) auctions are used to transact large
   quantities of homogeneous goods, and therefore use multiunit mechanisms.
   In the B2B context, bidders often have increasing returns to scale, or
   synergies. We compare two commonly used auction formats for selling
   multiple homogeneous objects, both sometimes called "Dutch" auctions, in
   a set of value environments that include synergies and potentially
   subject bidders to the "exposure" and "free-riding" problems. We find
   that the descending-price auction, best known for its use in the Dutch
   flower auctions, is robust and performs well in a variety of
   environments, although there are some situations in which the ascending
   uniform-price auction similar to the one used by eBay better avoids the
   free-riding problem. We discuss the factors that influence each
   mechanism's performance in terms of the overall efficiency, the
   informational requirements, the seller's revenue, and the buyer's
   profit.

AB T his paper theoretically and empirically examines the conventional
   wisdom in procurement management that often portrays supply inspections
   and supplier plant inspections as substitutes. We develop a theoretical
   model that focuses on potential internal spillover costs of the buyer
   receiving low-quality inputs and external spillover costs should
   low-quality inputs go undetected. Key to our analysis is the condition
   of whether a buyer can commit to the intensity of supply inspection. If
   a buyer cannot commit, supply inspections and plant inspections are
   substitutes, as widely believed. The two types of inspections, however,
   may become complements when a buyer is able to commit to the intensity
   of supply inspection. Complementarity is especially likely when (a)
   external spillovers are smaller than expected internal spillovers, which
   depends on the level of buffer inventory, (b) when knowledge sharing
   between buyer and supplier becomes more effective as the supplier
   allocates more resources to learning for quality improvement, or (c)
   when hiding aspects of the production processes is easier for suppliers.
   We empirically evaluate our model with a new data set drawn from a large
   biotechnology manufacturer. Empirical results provide broad support for
   theory, which, we argue, might help to explain variation in inspection
   practices across industries. Our theory and empirical analysis
   contribute to the literatures on strategic management, organizational
   economics, and procurement management by highlighting the organizational
   and strategic use of inspection practices.

   the systems have different variabilities. The two decentralized systems
   consider an agreement to pool their production capacities. We examine
   the impact of the pooling of capacity on inventory costs under two
   operating rules: (i) the orders from the two warehouses are treated in a
   first-come-first-served manner, and (ii) the orders from the
   lower-variability warehouse are given nonpreemptive priority.
   We examine this issue using an analytical model that integrates
   base-stock inventory models with queuing models for the production
   capacity. The higher-variability demand is modeled as a hyperexponential
   renewal process, and the lower-variability demand is modeled as a
   Poisson process. In case of pooled capacity, the arrival process at the
   production queue is the superposition of the two processes. We prove
   conditions under which the first-come-first-served operating rule will
   fail to achieve a Pareto improvement over the separate systems because
   it would increase inventory cost at the lower-variability warehouse. We
   then show cases under which the high-variability warehouse will see a
   reduction in inventory cost over the split system even if it accepts
   lower priority.

AB Experimental evidence suggests that production-line workers adjust their
   work rates in certain situations to prevent idle time. We refer to this
   as state-dependent behavior, in contrast to the state-independent
   behavior of machines. In this paper, we develop several models for the
   state-dependent behavior of production workers. We then use these models
   to analyze the relation of line length to throughput in these systems.
   We find that state-dependent behavior makes serial lines more efficient
   and reduces the detrimental effects that longer line lengths have on
   throughput. In some cases, line efficiency can actually increase with
   length. This is a result of a higher percentage of workers having two
   buffers to provide feedback on the state of the line. Further, we show
   that workers who both speed up when they are likely to cause idle time
   for others and slow down when they are likely to become idle themselves
   improve the overall efficiency of the line.

AB This research examines media richness by modeling face-to-face,
   telephone, and electronic media as one construct and testing its
   performance implications. The context is the third-party logistics
   industry, in which a customer firm allows a service provider to assume
   responsibility for all or part of a critical business process. This
   business-to-business service environment is characterized by high levels
   of complexity (uncertainty, variability, equivocality) and network
   interdependence, key contextual attributes that enhance media richness'
   impact. We found a direct effect of media richness on relational
   performance and through it, indirect effects on satisfaction and
   loyalty. Furthermore, we found a direct effect of media richness on
   loyalty, which suggests that service firms in networked relationships
   provide loyalty-inducing benefits the genesis of which is not in the
   satisfaction created by the service itself. While past studies have
   examined the relationship of richness-related constructs and
   performance, no significant link was found. Our study is the first to
   demonstrate that media richness can affect firm performance when
   businesses interact in a complex environment.

   these databases can be useful in identifying those customers most likely
   to purchase a new product and in predicting when this adoption may take
   place. This can assist database marketers in determining when
   individuals should be targeted for the promotion of a new product, which
   may increase the efficiency of manufacturing and distribution, and
   assure a faster return on investments. For this purpose, we propose a
   model that considers the timing of past purchases across multiple
   product categories and produces estimates of each customer's propensity
   of ever purchasing in a particular product category and of the timing of
   their purchases. The model is designed to help managers identify the
   best prospects for a new offer in one of multiple categories based on
   generalizations obtained from past offers. The proposed model also
   provides projections of aggregate penetration for new brands within the

AB In a recent paper, Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) suggest a method to
   American option valuation based on simulation. The method is termed the
   Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) method, and although it has become
   widely used, not much is known about the properties of the estimator.
   This paper corrects this shortcoming using theory from the literature on
   seminonparametric series estimators. A central part of the LSM method is
   the approximation of a set of conditional expectation functions. We show
   that the approximations converge to the true expectation functions under
   general assumptions in a multiperiod, multidimensional setting. We
   obtain convergence rates in the two-period, multidimensional case, and
   we discuss the relation between the optimal rate of convergence and the
   properties of the conditional expectation. Furthermore, we show that the
   actual price estimates converge to the true price. This provides the
   mathematical foundation for the use of the LSM method in derivatives
   research.

AB Characterizing asset return dynamics using volatility models is an

   models favors some rather complex volatility specifications whose
   relative performance is usually assessed through their likelihood based
   on a time series of asset returns. This paper compares a range of GARCH
   models along a different dimension, using option prices and returns
   under the risk-neutral as well as the physical probability measure. We
   judge the relative performance of various models by evaluating an
   objective function based on option prices. In contrast with
   returns-based inference, we find that our option-based objective
   function favors a relatively parsimonious model. Specifically, when
   evaluated out-of-sample, our analysis favors a model that, besides
   volatility clustering, only allows for a standard leverage effect.

AB A well-known view in the literature is that if management is more
   concerned with the firm's survival than with profitability, it is
   efficient to use a levered capital structure and thereby transfer the
   liquidation decision to lenders. Our paper extends this idea to a
   setting where lenders behave opportunistically when they control the
   liquidation decision. We show that in this situation, an optimal mix of
   debt and dividends, can mitigate the twin moral hazard problems of the
   manager and the lender. Given an otherwise optimal capital structure,
   initiating a dividend policy increases firm value, lowers debt payments,
   but raises total cash disbursements-interest and dividends-to investors.
   Numerous other empirical implications of the model are also discussed.

   confidence level, a CVaR constraint is tighter than a VaR constraint if
   the CVaR and VaR bounds coincide. Consequently, a CVaR constraint is
   more effective than a VaR constraint as a tool to control slightly
   risk-averse agents, but in the absence of a risk-free security, has a
   perverse effect in that it is more likely to force highly risk-averse
   agents to select portfolios with larger standard deviations. However,
   when the CVaR bound is appropriately larger than the VaR bound or when a
   risk-free security is present, a CVaR constraint "dominates" a VaR
   constraint as a risk management tool.

AB Most of the traditional models in production and inventory control
   ignore the financial states of an organization and can lead to
   infeasible practices in real systems. This paper is the first attempt to
   incorporate asset-based financing into production decisions. Instead of
   setting a known, exogenously determined budgetary constraint as most
   existing models suggest, we model the available cash in each period as a
   function of assets and liabilities that may be updated periodically
   according to the dynamics of the production activities. Furthermore, our
   models allow different interest rates on cash balance and outstanding
   loans, which is an enhancement over most traditional models in that
   inventory financed by a loan may be more expensive than that by
   out-of-pocket cash. We demonstrate the importance of joint consideration
   of production and financing decisions in a start-up setting in which the
   ability to grow the firm is mainly constrained by its limited capital
   and dependence on bank financing. We then explain the motivation for
   asset-based financing by examining the decision making at a bank and a
   set of retailers in a newsvendor setting.

AB Companies innovating in dynamic environments face the combined challenge
   of unforeseeable uncertainty (the inability to recognize the relevant
   influence variables and their functional relationships; thus, events and
   actions cannot be planned ahead of time) and high complexity (large
   number of variables and interactions; this leads to difficulty in
   assessing optimal actions beforehand).
   There are two fundamental strategies to manage innovation with
   unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity: trial and error learning and
   selectionism. Trial and error learning involves a flexible (unplanned)
   adjustment of the considered actions and targets to new information
   about the relevant environment as it emerges. Selectionism involves
   pursuing several approaches independently of one another and picking the
   best one ex post.
   Neither strategy nor project management literatures have compared the
   relative advantages of the two approaches in the presence of
   unforeseeable uncertainty and complexity. We build a model of a complex
   project with unforeseeable uncertainty, simulating problem solving as a
   local search on a rugged landscape. We compare the project payoff
   performance under trial and error learning and selectionism, based on a
   priori identifiable project characteristics: whether unforeseeable
   uncertainty is present, how high the complexity is, and how much trial
   and error learning and parallel trials cost. We find that if
   unforeseeable uncertainty is present and the team cannot run trials in a
   realistic user environment (indicating the project's true market
   performance), trial and error learning is preferred over selectionism.
   Moreover, the presence of unforeseeable uncertainty can reverse an
   established result from computational optimization: Without
   unforeseeable uncertainty, the optimal number of parallel trials
   increases in complexity. But with unforeseeable uncertainty, the optimal
   number of trials might decrease because the unforeseeable factors make
   the trials less and less informative as complexity grows.

   process in which the interplay of the availability of innovation
   infrastructure and variety of ideas influences the level of innovation

   terms of market structure and industrial policies lead to different

AB Many organizational actions need not have any immediate or direct payoff
   consequence but set the stage for subsequent actions that bring the
   organization toward some actual payoff. Learning in such settings poses
   the challenge of credit assignment (Minsky 1961), that is, how to assign
   credit for the overall outcome of a sequence of actions to each of the
   antecedent actions. To explore the process of learning in such contexts,
   we create a formal model in which the actors develop a mental model of
   the value of stage-setting actions as a complex problem-solving task is
   repeated. Partial knowledge, either of particular states in the problem
   space or inefficient and circuitous routines through the space, is shown
   to be quite valuable. Because of the interdependence of intelligent
   action when a sequence of actions must be identified, however,
   organizational knowledge is relatively fragile. As a consequence, while
   turnover may stimulate search and have largely benign implications in
   less interdependent task settings, it is very destructive of the
   organization's near-term performance when the learning problem requires
   a complementarity among the actors' knowledge.

AB After a merger, company officials face the challenge of making
   compensation schemes uniform and of redesigning teams with managers from
   companies with different incentives, work habits, and recruiting
   methods. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between
   executive pay and performance after a merger by dissociating the
   respective influence of shifts, which occur in both compensation
   incentives and team composition. The results of a real task experiment
   conducted with managers within a large pharmaceutical company not only
   show that changes in compensation incentives affect performance, but
   also suggest that the sorting effect of incentives in the previous
   companies impact cooperation and efficiency after the merger.
   Replicating this experiment with students showed differences in strategy
   rather than in substance between the two groups of subjects with
   managers appearing performance driven, while students are more cost
   driven.

AB This paper develops the first operational tests of portfolio efficiency
   based on the general stochastic dominance (SD) criteria that account for
   an infinite set of diversification strategies. The main insight is to
   preserve the cross-sectional dependence of asset returns when forming
   portfolios by reexpressing the SD criteria in T-dimensional Euclidean
   space, with elements representing rates of return in T different states
   of nature. We characterize subsets of this state-space that dominate a
   given evaluated return vector by first- and second-order SD. This allows
   us to derive simple SD efficiency measures and test statistics,
   computable by standard mathematical programming algorithms. The SD tests
   and efficiency measures are illustrated by an empirical application that
   analyzes industrial diversification of the market portfolio.

AB A bidding strategy commonly observed in Internet auctions is that of
   "jump bidding," or entering a bid larger than what is necessary to be a
   currently winning bidder. In this paper, we argue that the cost
   associated with entering online bids and the uncertainty about future
   entry-both of which distinguish Internet from live auctions-can explain
   this behavior. We present a simple theoretical model that includes the
   preceding characteristics, and derive the conditions under which jump
   bidding arises in a format commonly used for online trading, the
   ascending-price auction. We also present evidence, recorded from
   hundreds of Internet auctions, that is consistent with some of the basic
   predictions from our model. We find that jump bidding is more likely
   earlier in an auction, when jumping has a larger strategic value, and
   that the incentives to jump bid increase as competition increases. Our
   results also indicate that jump bidding is effective: Jump bidders place
   fewer bids overall, and increased early jump bidding deters entry later
   in the auction. We also discuss possible means of reducing bidding costs
   and evidence that Internet auctioneers are pursuing this goal.

AB We consider the problem of allocating demand arising from multiple
   products to multiple production facilities with finite capacity and
   load-dependent lead times. Production facilities can choose to
   manufacture items either to stock or to order. Products vary in their
   demand rates, holding and backordering costs, and service-level
   requirements. We develop models and solution procedures to determine the
   optimal allocation of demand to facilities and the optimal inventory
   level for products at each facility. We consider two types of demand
   allocation, one in which we allow the demand for a product to be split
   among multiple facilities and the other in which demand from each
   product must be entirely satisfied by a single facility. We also
   consider two forms of inventory warehousing, one in which inventory
   locations are factory based and one in which they are centralized. For
   each case, we offer a solution procedure to obtain optimal demand
   allocations and optimal inventory base-stock levels. For systems with
   multiple customer classes, we also determine optimal inventory rationing
   levels for each class for each product. We use the models to
   characterize analytically several properties of the optimal solution. In
   particular, we highlight eight principles that relate the effects of
   cost, congestion, inventory pooling, multiple sourcing, customer
   segmentation, inventory rationing, and process and demand variability.

AB To provide useful practical insight into the performance of
   service-oriented (non-revenue-generating) call centers, which often
   provide low-to-moderate quality of service, this paper investigates the
   efficiency-driven (ED), many-server heavy-traffic limiting regime for
   queues with abandonments. Attention is focused on the M/M/s/r + M model,
   having a Poisson arrival process, exponential service times, s servers,
   r extra waiting spaces, exponential abandon times (the final +M), and
   the first-come-first-served service discipline. Both the number of
   servers and the arrival rate are allowed to increase, while the
   individual service and abandonment rates are held fixed. The key is how
   the two limits are related: In the now common
   quality-and-efficiency-driven (QED) or Halfin-Whitt limiting regime, the
   probability of initially being delayed approaches a limit strictly
   between 0 and 1, while the probability of eventually being served (not
   abandoning) approaches 1. In contrast, in the ED limiting regime, the
   probability of eventually being served approaches a limit strictly
   between 0 and 1, while the probability of initially being delayed
   approaches 1. To obtain the ED regime, it suffices to let the arrival
   rate and the number of servers increase with the traffic intensity rho
   held fixed with p > 1 (so that the arrival rate exceeds the maximum
   possible service rate). The ED regime can be realistic because with the
   abandonments, the delays need not be extraordinarily large. When the ED
   appropriations are appropriate, they are appealing because they are
   remarkably simple.

AB This article provides a personal perspective on the themes and topics
   that have emerged in research published by the department of
   organizational behavior, in the first 50 years of Management Science. A
   review of articles accepted by the department suggests several themes
   that reflect broad objectives, such as "improving management science
   models," or distinguishing points of view or assumptions, such as
   "treating organizations as decision-making entities." The research is
   summarized through topics and subtopics that classify the subjects and
   findings of the research, identifying the relative popularity of the
   topics, and their contribution to each of the themes. The pattern
   suggests that as a "behavioral" department in a journal characterized by
   managerial practice, optimization, and the context of real work
   organizations, research is uniquely grounded in applications, solutions,
   and work consequences in ways that are less prevalent in typical outlets
   for behavioral research. The article concludes by suggesting that there
   are ample signs of convergence across departments in the journal.
   Scholars in organizational behavior increasingly recognize that the
   context provided by other management disciplines provides essential
   insights. Likewise, scholars in other management disciplines
   increasingly recognize the value of integrating behavioral theories and
   findings into their frameworks and models.

   test a model of two-party (dyadic) knowledge exchange, with strong
   support in each of the three companies surveyed. First, the link between
   strong ties and receipt of useful knowledge (as reported by the
   knowledge seeker) was mediated by competence- and benevolence-based
   trust. Second, once we controlled for these two trustworthiness
   dimensions, the structural benefit of weak ties emerged. This finding is
   consistent with prior research suggesting that weak ties provide access
   to non-redundant information. Third, competence-based trust was

   Few studies, however, have examined the difficulties of evaluating

   study of capabilities central to knowledge management efforts in large
   leading multinational companies. The results show that evaluation of
   these capabilities is a complex task. The median interrater correlation
   for capabilities designated as strategic by top management is only 0.28.
   Analysis of the determinants of reliability show that the difference in
   evaluations is largest for subsidiaries managers know less about, for
   younger subsidiaries, and for subsidiaries in less important markets.
   The results of our empirical study have important implications for

AB A firm's ability to manage its knowledge-based resource capabilities has
   become increasingly important as a result of performance threats
   triggered by technology change and intense competition. At the
   manufacturing plant level, we focus on three repositories of knowledge
   that drive performance. First, the physical production or information
   systems represent knowledge embedded in the plant's technical systems.
   Second, the plant's workforce has knowledge, including diverse
   scientific information and skills, to effectively operate the technical
   systems. Third, the firm's managerial systems embody knowledge in the
   form of goals, reward systems, and control and coordination systems.
   Taken together, we consider the technical systems, workforce knowledge,
   and the managerial systems as the plant's knowledge-based resource
   capability.
   Two normative models are introduced offering insight on how plant
   performance is impacted by investments in workforce knowledge (training)
   or the technical systems (process change). The models explicitly
   recognize that the outcome of investments in knowledge-based change is
   uncertain due to factors including technical problems, worker
   resistance, and limited financial resources. Also, we recognize that
   workforce knowledge may be deployed to mitigate the outcome uncertainty
   encountered with process change.
   Investments in knowledge-based change cannot be fully understood in
   isolation of the managerial systems. In one model, the plant manager is
   motivated by an incentive system that rewards the realization of a
   threshold goal, whereas in the other model the incentive system
   emphasizes the realization of meeting a particular target goal. We also
   investigate the impact of the manager's view of uncertainty (her
   willingness to absorb risk), which is influenced by the managerial
   systems. Results show that different characterizations of the managerial
   systems have a profound effect on managerial behavior and plant-level
   performance.

   MBA consulting teams (261 members) participated in the study. I proposed
   that the role and function of TMSs change to meet different task and
   knowledge demands during a project. Hypotheses predicting that TMSs
   emerge during a project-planning phase as a function of a team's initial
   conditions, and later develop and mature as a function of the nature and
   frequency of communication were generally supported, as were
   hypothesized relationships between TMSs and team performance and
   viability. Findings suggest that teams with initially distributed
   expertise and familiar members are more likely to develop a TMS.
   Frequent face-to-face communication also led to TMS emergence, but
   communication via other means had no effect. Teams with more established
   TMSs later benefited from face-to-face communication, but they were less
   helped by frequent communication via other means, suggesting that
   transactive retrieval processes may have been triggered during
   face-to-face communication and suppressed during other types of
   communication. TMSs were positively related to team viability and team
   performance, suggesting that developing a TMS is critical to the
   effectiveness of knowledge-worker teams.

   development, differ significantly between lower- and higher-performing

AB What is the role of volition in organizational learning? Do firms learn
   better in response to internal procedures or external mandates? Existing
   literature provides conflicting answers to this question, with some
   theories suggesting that volition is important for learning because
   autonomy increases commitment and problem analyses, whereas external
   mandates tend to produce defensive reactions that are not coupled to the
   organization in any useful way. Yet, other theories suggest that mandate
   is important for learning because external pressures act as jolts that
   help overcome organizational inertia, resulting in deep exploration of
   problems to prevent future surprises. We investigate this issue in the
   context of automakers learning from voluntary versus involuntary product
   recalls. Using data on all recalls experienced by automakers that sold
   passenger cars in the United States during the 1966-1999 period, we
   follow the learning-curve tradition in investigating the effects of
   voluntary and involuntary recalls on subsequent recall rates. We find
   that voluntary recalls result in more learning than mandated recalls
   when learning is measured as a reduction in subsequent involuntary
   recalls. This effect is at least partly because of shallower learning
   processes that result from involuntary recalls. The effect of volition,
   however, is different for generalist and specialist automakers. The
   results of this study suggest an important, yet understudied,
   determinant of the rate and effectiveness of learning-volition. The
   results also add to our knowledge of the different learning processes of
   generalist and specialist organizations.

AB Organization structure acts as a lens on the environment, gathering
   information and shaping its flow through a firm to inform managers'
   choices. This shaping of information flow happens through an
   organization's operating units, which selectively process information
   from the environment, and through the links between them, which pass
   information between units. We explore the relationship between this
   "information infrastructure" and firm strategy using structure and
   service information from the eight largest telephone service providers
   in the United States from 1984 to 1998. We find that firms with more
   units that scan areas of opportunity are more likely to enter a market,
   while firms with more units that scan nonfocal areas are less likely to
   enter the market. We also find that personnel links between units and
   the corporate level of the firm often constrain entry to new markets by
   dampening a unit's appetite for risk. Personnel links between operating
   units, on the other hand, can make a firm more likely to enter new
   markets, particularly when the cooperating units combine different sets
   of information. Thus, a firm's information infrastructure plays a dual
   role in shaping firm evolution, leading toward some paths and away from
   others.

AB This study asserted that quality improvement (QI) requires the
   coexistence of two cultural values of innovation and attention to detail
   and proposed that their coexistence depends on the implementation of
   multiple QI practices. A longitudinal QI intervention, with five phases,
   consisting of multiple QI practices-ISO 9000, QI teams, quality goals,
   and coaching and communication by top management-was implemented.
   Participants were 425 employees working in 18 departments of four
   manufacturing plants. The QI practices were implemented in a different
   order in each one of the plants. Measures were assessed five times, at
   the end of each implementation phase. We used hierarchical linear models
   (HLM) to account for the nested structure of departments within the
   plants and the five repeated measures.
   Findings demonstrated that the above-mentioned QI practices had
   differential effects on innovation and attention to detail: ISO 9000
   positively affected attention to detail but negatively affected
   innovation. Both QI teams and quality goals positively affected
   innovation. Thus, the multiple QI initiative enabled the coexistence of
   the two aforementioned cultural values. Both cultural values had a
   positive impact on performance quality and productivity and partially
   mediated the effects of ISO 9000 on productivity.

AB Electronic reputation or "feedback" mechanisms aim to mitigate the moral
   hazard problems associated with exchange among strangers by providing
   the type of information available in more traditional close-knit groups,
   where members are frequently involved in one another's dealings. In this
   paper, we compare trading in a market with online feedback (as
   implemented by many Internet markets) to a market without feedback, as
   well as to a market in which the same people interact with one another
   repeatedly (partners market). We find that while the feedback mechanism
   induces quite a substantial improvement in transaction efficiency, it
   also exhibits a kind of public goods problem in that, unlike in the
   partners market, the benefits of trust and trustworthy behavior go to
   the whole community and are not completely internalized. We discuss the
   implications of this perspective for improving feedback systems.

AB We study a model of imperfect competition and limited production
   capacity in which a key feature is the trade-off between quality and
   quantity. In particular, lowering product quality enables firms to
   increase total production. We illustrate that, in the presence of
   limited capacity, the choice of lower quality often results in increased
   social welfare. We also explore the relation between the extent of
   competition and the choice of quality. We find that, in some cases,
   reduced competition leads to increased production, decreased average
   quality, increased total welfare, and makes consumers better off.
   Finally, we consider the possibility of regulator-mandated quality
   standards. Imposing high-quality standards never improves welfare in our
   model. On the other hand, mandating an upper bound on quality could
   either increase or decrease welfare in either a monopoly or a duopoly
   market.

AB This paper analyzes optimal pricing for information goods under
   incomplete information, when both unlimited-usage (fixed-fee) pricing
   and usage-based pricing are feasible and administering usage-based
   pricing may involve transaction costs. It is shown that offering
   fixed-fee pricing in addition to a nonlinear usage-based pricing scheme
   is always profit improving in the presence of nonzero transaction costs,
   and there may be markets in which a pure fixed-fee is optimal. This
   implies that the optimal pricing strategy for information goods is
   almost never fully revealing. Moreover, it is proved that the optimal
   usage-based pricing schedule is independent of the value of the fixed
   fee, a result that simplifies the simultaneous design of pricing
   schedules considerably and provides a simple procedure for determining
   the optimal combination of fixed-fee and nonlinear usage-based pricing.
   The introduction of fixed-fee pricing is shown to increase both consumer
   surplus and total surplus. The differential effects of setup costs,
   fixed transaction costs, and variable transaction costs on pricing
   policy are described. These results suggest a number of managerial
   guidelines for designing pricing schedules. For instance, in nascent
   information markets, firms may profit from low fixed-fee penetration
   pricing, but as these markets mature, the optimal pricing mix should
   expand to include a wider range of usage-based pricing options. Minimum
   fees, quantity discounts, and adoption levels across the different
   pricing schemes are characterized, strategic pricing responses to
   changes in market characteristics are described, and the implications of
   the paper's results for bundling and vertical differentiation of
   information goods are discussed.

AB Product architecture knowledge is typically embedded in the
   communication patterns of established development organizations. While
   this enables the development of products using the existing
   architecture, it hinders the organization's ability to implement novel
   architectures, especially for complex products. Structured methods
   addressing this issue are lacking, as previous research has studied
   complex product development from two separate perspectives: product
   architecture and organizational structure. Our research integrates these
   viewpoints with a structured approach to study how design interfaces in
   them product architecture map onto communication patterns within the
   development organization. We investigate how organizational and system
   boundaries, design interface strength; indirect interactions, and system
   modularity impact the alignment of design interfaces and team
   interactions. We hypothesize and test how these factors explain the
   existence of the following cases: (1) known design interfaces not
   addressed by team intractions, and (2) observed team interactions not
   predicted by design interfaces. Our results offer important insights to
   managers dealing with interdependences across organizational and
   functional boundaries. In particular, we show how boundary effects
   moderate the impact of design interface strength and indirect team
   interactions and are contingent on system modularity. The research uses
   data collected from a large commercial aircraft engine development
   process.

AB This paper explores the linkages between key features of the new product
   development (NPD) process and NPD performance and suggests ways of
   designing the process to improve performance. Using a stochastic
   computer model, we examine, under varying uncertainty conditions, how
   the key features of overlapping and functional interaction affect the
   performance measures of development time and effort (total person-days
   for a project). Findings indicate that, first and foremost, whether or
   not overlapping occurs, increasing functional interaction eventually
   leads to a trade-off between development time and effort. Second, an
   "early-start-in-the-dark" approach of increasing overlapping with no
   functional interaction is inferior even to an "over-the-wall" approach.
   Third, increasing overlapping when some functional interaction exists is
   beneficial in low uncertainty and harmful in high uncertainty Fourth,
   concurrent engineering (CE) is appropriate under low uncertainty, while
   a type of sequential engineering (SE), different than the
   "over-the-wall" approach, should be used under high uncertainty, and
   last, dedicated teams are suitable under high, and not low, uncertainty.
   We developed the model with the aid of a company and validated it
   against a published account of five case studies.

AB uch public attention and considerable controversy surround
   pharmaceutical marketing practices and their impact on physicians.
   However, views on the matter have largely been shaped by anecdotal
   evidence or results from analyses with insufficient controls. Making use
   of a dynamic fixed-effects distributed lag regression model, we
   empirically assess the role that two central components of
   pharmaceutical marketing practices (namely, detailing and sampling) have
   on physician prescribing behavior. Key differentiating features of our
   model include its ability to (i) capture persistence in the prescribing
   process and decompose it into own-growth and competitive-stealing
   effects, (ii) estimate an unrestricted decay structure of the
   promotional effects over time, and (iii) control for physician-specific
   effects that, if not taken into account, induce biased coefficient
   estimates of detailing and sampling,effects. Based on pooled time series
   cross-sectional data involving three drugs, 24 monthly observations, and
   74,07 individual physicians (more than 2 million observations in total),
   we find that detailing and free drug samples have positive and
   statistically significant effects on the number of new prescriptions
   issued by a physician. However, we find that the magnitudes of the
   effects are modest.

   franchisors. Experience of individual owners and franchisees should
   result in knowledge that is tacit-and idiosyncratic and thus primarily
   of value locally Because franchisors typically codify knowledge gained
   from experience, we argue that units should benefit from both local and
   distant experience of their franchisor. Using Texan pizza restaurant
   failure data, we found that the units of all multiunit owners,
   franchised or not, benefited from their owner's local congenital
   experience, but not from distantly gained experience. Further, the
   franchisor's local experience reduced failure rates. Contrary to one
   hypothesis, franchisors' distant experience did not prove beneficial. In
   addition, a complementary effect was found for owner and franchisor
   congenital experience. These results highlight the continued importance
   of local experience, even among the most codified and standardized

AB We consider stock positioning in a pure assembly system controlled using
   installation base-stock policies. When component suppliers have random
   capacity and end-product demand is uncertain, we characterize the
   system's inventory dynamics. We show that components and, the, end
   product. play convex complementary roles in providing customer service.
   We propose a decomposition approach that uses an internal service level
   to independently determine near-optimal stock levels for each component.
   Compared with the optimal, the average error of the decomposition
   approach is 0.66% across the tested instances. Compared with current
   practice, this approach has the potential to reduce the safety-stock
   cost by as much as 30%. Our computational analysis on two-echelon
   systems also illustrates several managerial insights: We observe that
   the cost reduction from improving supply performance is high when demand
   variability or the number of components or target customer service is
   high, or when the end product is more expensive relative to components.
   On average, (i) reducing the lead time of the more expensive component
   yielded higher-benefit than reducing the lead time for the less
   expensive component, and (ii) the benefit of improving one of the supply
   parameters (service level or lead time) was higher when the value of the
   other parameter was already more favorable (lower lead time or higher
   service level, respectively). Finally, we analytically show how a
   multi-echelon pure assembly system may be converted into an equivalent
   two-echelon assembly system to which all our results apply.

AB Observers argue that evidence for the persuasive role of advertising
   comes from competitive categories where increases in advertising lead to
   higher average prices. Conversely, others claim that advertising serves
   a purely informational role. Here, higher levels of advertising lead to
   better-informed consumers and this should increase competition and
   stimulate lower prices. The objective of this study is to neither
   confirm nor refute either of these perspectives. It is rather to show
   that increases in informative advertising alone can lead to both higher
   or lower prices. I further show that the direction of this relationship
   depends on the level of differentiation between competing firms. Similar
   to Grossman and Shapiro (1984), I examine conditions where the
   differences between competing products are small, but I also examine
   conditions where the differences are significant. The role of
   advertising is to inform consumers about individual products and higher
   advertising for a product means that more of the potential market knows
   about it. Higher levels of advertising increase the relative importance
   of fully informed consumers compared to partially informed consumers.
   This dynamic is the basis for explaining why informative advertising can
   push prices either up or down in a uniformly distributed spatial market.

AB Kara and Tansel (Management Science, Volume 47, 2001, 1408-1420)
   introduce the latest arrival hub location problem as a more realistic
   way of modeling cargo delivery. The key feature of the new model is that
   each link in the network is served by a single vehicle that makes
   exactly bone trip. As a result, the traffic requiring a particular link
   may be,forced to wait for all other traffic requiring the same link to
   arrive. Therefore, the travel time between a particular pair of nodes
   depends not just on travel times of the links on the path taken, but
   also on these forced "waiting times," which are called transient times
   in Kara and Tansel (2001). We show, however, that if the objective
   function depends only on the maximum travel time, this "new" model is
   essentially the same as the classical model that ignores the transient
   times. Our result implies that two of the three versions of the latest
   arrival hub location problem proposed by Kara and Tansel, including the
   one to, which they devote most of their paper, are equivalent to their

   the mobile banking service is behind the expectation of banks and mobile

   mobile banking may be the lack of consumers' initial trust on the

   building trust and intention to use mobile banking services. Our
   research results show that propensity-to-trust, structural assurance,
   and relative advantages of services have significant impacts on
   consumers' initial trust in mobile banking service. Furthermore, initial
   trust in mobile banking service is a critical factor for adopting mobile
   banking services. Contrary to our expectation, however, reputation of

   teach us that incentive contracts are not the only source of incentives.
   Finally (and especially relevant to supply transactions), the

   single supplier servicing a network of (competing) retailers,
   considering the following general model: Retailers face random demands,
   the distribution of which may depend only on its own retail price
   (noncompeting retailers) or on its own price as well as those of the
   other retailers (competing retailers), according to general stochastic
   demand functions.

AB Under a revenue-sharing contract, a retailer pays a supplier a wholesale
   price for each unit purchased, plus a percentage of the revenue the
   retailer generates. Such contracts have become more prevalent in the
   videocassette rental industry relative to the more conventional
   wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts
   in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each
   retailer's purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or
   stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or outright
   sales. Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical
   fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate
   that revenue sharing coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer
   (i.e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily
   allocates the supply chain's profit. We compare revenue sharing to a
   number of other supply chain contracts (e.g., buy-back contracts,
   price-discount contracts, quantity-flexibility contracts, sales-rebate
   contracts, franchise contracts, and quantity discounts). We find that
   revenue sharing is equivalent to buybacks in the newsvendor case and
   equivalent to price discounts in the price-setting newsvendor case.
   Revenue sharing also coordinates a supply chain with retailers competing
   in quantities, e.g., Cournot competitors or competing newsvendors with
   fixed prices. Despite its numerous merits, we identify several
   limitations of revenue sharing to (at least partially) explain why it is
   not prevalent in all industries. In particular, we characterize cases in
   which revenue sharing provides only a small improvement over the
   administratively cheaper wholesale price contract. Additionally, revenue
   sharing does not coordinate a supply chain with demand that depends on
   costly retail effort. We develop a variation on revenue sharing for this
   setting.

AB In this paper, we study competition in multiechelon supply chains with
   an assembly structure. Firms in the supply chain are grouped into
   homogenous sectors (nodes) that contain identical firms with identical
   production capabilities that all produce exactly one undifferentiated
   product (that may itself be a "kit" of components). Each sector may use
   several inputs to produce its product, and these inputs are supplied by
   different sectors. The production process within any sector is taken to
   be pure assembly in fixed proportions. The number of firms in each
   sector is known. The demand curve for the final product is assumed to be
   linear, as are production costs in all sectors. Competition is modeled
   via a "coordinated successive Cournot" model in which firms choose
   production quantities for their downstream market so as to maximize
   profits, given prices for all inputs and all complementary products.
   Production quantities for sectors supplying the same successor are
   coordinated through pricing mechanisms, so that complementary products
   are produced in the right proportions. Under these assumptions,
   equilibrium prices for any multiechelon assembly network are
   characterized by a system of linear equations. We derive closed-form
   expressions for equilibrium quantities and prices in any two-stage
   system (i.e., a system with multiple input sectors and a single assembly
   sector). We show that any assembly structure can be converted to an
   equivalent (larger) structure in which no more than two components are
   assembled at any node. Finally, large structures can be solved either by
   direct solution of the characteristic linear equations or through an
   iterative reduction (compression) to smaller structures.

AB Salespeople are the eyes and ears of the firms they serve. They possess
   market knowledge that is critical for a wide range of decisions. A key
   question is how a firm can provide incentives to its salesforce so that
   it is in their interest to truthfully disclose their information about
   the market and to work hard. Many people have considered this question
   and provided solutions. Perhaps the most well-known solution is due to
   Gonik (1978), who proposed and implemented a clever scheme designed to
   elicit market information and encourage hard work. The purpose of this
   paper is to study Gonik's scheme and compare it with a menu of linear
   contracts - a solution often used in the agency literature - in a model
   where the market information possessed by the salesforce is important
   for the firm's production and inventory-planning decisions.

AB We address the problem of designing multi-item procurement auctions for
   a monopsonistic buyer in capacity-constrained environments. Using
   insights from classical auction theory, we construct an
   optimization-based auction mechanism ("smart market") relying on the
   dynamic resolution of a linear program minimizing the buyer's cost under
   the suppliers' capacity constraints. Suppliers can modify their offers
   in response to the optimal allocation corresponding to each set of bids,
   giving rise to a dynamic competitive bidding process. To assist
   suppliers, we also develop a bidding-suggestion device based on a myopic
   best-response (MBR) calculation that solves an associated optimization
   problem. Assuming linear costs for the suppliers, we study within a
   game-theoretic framework the sequence of bids arising in this smart
   market. Under a weak behavioral assumption and some symmetry
   requirements, an explicit upper bound for the winning bids is
   established. We then formulate a complete behavioral model and solution
   methodology based on the MBR rationale and show that the bounds derived
   earlier continue to hold. We analytically derive some structural and
   convergence properties of the MBR dynamics in the simplest nontrivial
   market environment, which suggests further possible design improvements,
   and investigate bidding dynamics and incentive compatibility issues via
   numerical simulations.

AB In different industries, such as automobiles, chemicals, or retailing,
   competitors are joining forces in establishing electronic marketplaces
   to reduce inefficiencies in the purchasing process and cut costs by
   combining their buying power. Joining such an alliance leads to reduced
   costs, including those of possible rivals, because members share the
   development and operating costs. A company that joins an alliance agrees
   to share its suppliers with others, which may lead to more intense
   competition among the increased number of suppliers, and it may further
   benefit an alliance member at the expense of companies left outside the
   alliance. Natural questions that could arise, then, are when would a
   firm prefer to take part in an electronic marketplace joint venture;
   when would it prefer that other firms, possibly rivals, join the
   venture; and what are the financial consequences of either joining an
   alliance or remaining independent? In an attempt to gain a better
   understanding of the issues, we have developed a model of three
   retailers whose products may have a certain degree of substitutability.
   We provide some conditions, in terms of product substitutability and
   compatibility of retailers, that would lead to the formation of a
   three-member alliance, or a two-member alliance, or no alliance at all.
   We also study the effect of alliance structure and compatibility of
   retailers on the profit of a company.

AB This paper develops and analyzes a principal-agent model for product
   specification and production motivated by "core buying" decisions at an
   automobile manufacturer. The model focuses on two important elements of
   the "core" buyer's responsibility: (1) assessing the supplier's
   capability, and (2) allocating some or all of a fixed level of some
   buyer-internal resource to help the supplier. Under the contracting
   scheme we model, the buyer (principal) delegates the majority of product
   specification and production activity to the supplier (agent), but
   retains the flexibility to commit a given, observable amount of an
   internally available, limited resource (e.g., engineering hours) to help
   the supplier. The supplier, in turn, allocates his resource (e.g.,
   engineering hours) to produce the finished product. As in the motivating
   scenario, both the supplier's resource allocation and capability are
   assumed to be hidden from the buyer. Hence, the principal's problem is
   to determine a menu of (resource-commitment, transfer-price) contracts
   to minimize her total expected cost. Our analysis demonstrates that if
   buyer resource and supplier capability are substitutes, then the buyer's
   second-best involvement in the supplier's production process will be
   greater than first-best. The opposite is true if they are complements.
   Further, when the opportunity cost for the buyer's resource is zero,
   then in the substitutes case the buyer will commit all of its resource,
   while in the complements case the buyer may withhold some resources to
   screen the supplier type. We describe two applications of the model-one
   in inventory management and one in pharmaceutical drug discovery-to
   illustrate its applicability and versatility. Finally, we use insights
   from the model to suggest hypotheses for empirical study.

AB In this paper, we model a manufacturer that contracts with two
   retailers, who then choose retail prices and stocking quantities
   endogenously in a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. If the manufacturer designs
   a contract that is accepted by both retailers, it sets the wholesale
   price as a compromise between two conflicting roles: reducing intrabrand
   retail price competition and inducing retailers to stock closer to
   first-best levels (that is, optimum for the supply chain as a whole). In
   equilibrium, fill rates are less than first best. If, on the other hand,
   the manufacturer eliminates retail competition by designing a contract
   accepted by only one retailer, the assignment of consumers to retailers
   is inefficient. In either equilibrium, the performance of the supply
   chain is strictly less than first best. However, the manufacturer
   achieves first-best retail prices and fill rates if it can subsidize the
   retailers' leftover inventory. Absent such subsidies, the two-retailer
   equilibrium arises when the two retailers compete less intensively. In
   that equilibrium, numerical results indicate that the value of
   subsidizing unsold inventory is increasing in demand uncertainty,
   intensity of retail competition, and salvage value of inventory, and is
   decreasing in manufacturing cost and opportunity cost of shelf space.

AB In the electronics industry and others, original equipment manufacturers
   (OEMs) are selling their production facilities to contract manufacturers
   (CMs). The CMs achieve high capacity utilization through pooling
   (supplying many different OEMs). Meanwhile, the OEMs focus on
   innovation: research and development, product design, and marketing. We
   examine how this change in industry structure affects investment in
   innovation and capacity, and thus profitability. In particular,
   innovation is noncontractible, so OEMs will invest less in innovation
   than is ideal for the industry as a whole. Hence, although contract
   manufacturing improves capacity utilization, it may reduce the
   profitability of the industry as a whole by weakening the incentives for
   innovation. Contract manufacturing is not the only means to achieve
   capacity pooling. Alternatively, the OEMs can pool capacity with one
   another through supply contracts or a joint venture. This may result in
   underinvestment or overinvestment in innovation and capacity, but always
   increases profitability. We find that the sale of production facilities
   to a CM improves profitability for the industry as a whole if and only
   if OEMs are subsequently in a strong bargaining position vis-a-vis the
   CM. If the OEMs are indeed very strong, the gain from pooling capacity
   via contract manufacturing is maximized in industries with moderate cost
   of capacity.

   flexibility that we term "structural flexibility (SF)." We focus on
   strategic-level issues of how flexibility can be created by using
   multipurpose resources such as cross-trained labor, flexible machines,
   or flexible factories. The proposed structural flexibility method uses
   the structure of the capability pattern to generate indices that
   quantify the ability of a system to respond to variability in its
   environment. Simulations of serial and parallel queueing networks
   provide evidence that this index is useful in predicting the performance
   rank of alternative designs for implementing multifunctionality in the
   face of variability. The proposed methodology supports managerial
   insight into structural design of manufacturing and service systems at
   the strategic level.

AB Flexible capacity has been shown to be very effective to hedge against
   forecast errors at the investment stage. In a make-to-order environment,
   this flexibility can also be used to hedge against variability in
   customer orders in the short term. For that purpose, production levels
   must be adjusted each period to match current demands, to give priority
   to the higher margin product, or to satisfy the closest customer.
   However, this will result in swings in production, inducing larger order
   variability at upstream suppliers and significantly higher component
   inventory levels at the manufacturer. Through a stylized two-plant,
   two-product capacitated manufacturing setting, we show that the
   performance of the system depends heavily on the allocation mechanism
   used to assign products to the available capacity. Although managers
   would be inclined to give priority to higher-margin products or to
   satisfy customers from their closest production site, these practices
   lead to greater swings in production, result in higher operational
   costs, and may reduce profits.

   firms for the years 1987-2000 to investigate the correlation of
   inventory turnover with gross margin, capital intensity and sales
   surprise (the ratio of actual sales to expected sales for the year). The

   alternative metric of inventory productivity, adjusted inventory
   turnover, which empirically adjusts inventory turnover for changes in

AB Managers often employ market response models as decision aids and
   historical information of competitors' market outcomes to aid their
   competitive decisions in oligopolistic settings. However, little is
   known about how access to a decision aid or the availability of
   competitors' market outcomes impact a firm's competitive decisions
   (e.g., prices) or market outcomes resulting from those decisions (e.g.,
   profits), or how managers make these decisions across such informational
   conditions. Hence, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, we
   investigate whether access to a decision aid and historical information
   of competitors' outcomes yields more-or less-competitive decisions and
   outcomes. Second, we determine which learning constructs, such as choice
   reinforcement and beliefs about projected profits, best explain
   competitive actions across various information conditions. We find that
   relative to the availability of competitive information, access to a
   decision aid has a larger effect on lowering prices and profits. We also
   find that in two-firm markets, price competition is even more intense
   than in five-firm markets. Similarly, the availability of market share
   information leads to more aggressive pricing even when profits are held
   constant. Finally, we outline the implications of our findings in making
   managerial resource allocations to market research endeavors.

   performance is measured by its ability to meet delivery dates requested

   standard steady-state performance measures in the basic call-center
   queueing model M/GI/s/r + GI, which has a Poisson arrival process,
   independent and identically distributed (IID) service times with a
   general distribution, s servers, r extra waiting spaces and IID customer
   abandonment times with a general distribution. Empirical studies of call
   centers indicate that the service-time and abandon-time distributions
   often are not nearly exponential, so that it is important to go beyond
   the Markovian M/M/s/r + M special case, but the general service-time and
   abandon-time distributions make the realistic model very difficult to
   analyze directly. The proposed algorithm is based on an approximation by
   an appropriate Markovian M/M/s/r + M(n) queueing model, where M(n)
   denotes state-dependent abandonment rates. After making an additional
   approximation, steady-state waiting-time distributions are characterized
   via their Laplace transforms. Then the approximate distributions are
   computed by numerically inverting the transforms. Simulation experiments
   show that the approximation is quite accurate. The overall algorithm can
   be applied to determine desired staffing levels, e.g., the minimum
   number of servers needed to guarantee that, first, the abandonment rate
   is below any specified target value and, second, that the conditional
   probability that an arriving customer will be served within a specified
   deadline, given that the customer eventually will be served, is at least
   a specified target value.

   arrival at a queue whose length is unobservable. We consider two bidding
   schemes that differ in the definition of bids (these may reflect either
   total payments or payments per unit of time) and in the timing of
   payments (before or after service). In both schemes, a customer obtains
   priority over all customers, waiting in the queue or arriving while he
   is waiting, who make lower bids. Our main results show how the
   convexity/concavity of the function expressing the costs of delay
   determines the queue discipline (i.e., shortest-processing-time-first

AB In many business transactions, labor-management relations, international
   conflicts, and welfare-state reforms, bargainers hold strong
   entitlements that are often generated by claims that are not feasible
   anymore. These entitlements seem to shape negotiation behavior
   considerably. By using the novel setup of a "bargaining with claims"
   experiment, we provide new systematic evidence tracking the influence of
   entitlements and obligations through the whole bargaining process. We
   find strong entitlement effects that shape opening offers, bargaining
   duration, concessions, and (dis)agreements. We argue that entitlements
   constitute a "moral property right" that is influential independent of
   negotiators' legal property rights.

AB One of the key problems in database marketing is the identification and
   profiling of households that are most likely to be interested in a
   particular product or service. Principal component analysis (PCA) of
   customer background information followed by logistic regression analysis
   of response behavior is commonly used by database marketers. In this
   paper, we propose a new approach that uses artificial neural networks
   (ANNs) guided by genetic algorithms (GAs) to target households. We show
   that the resulting selection rule is more accurate and more parsimonious
   than the PCA/logit rule when the manager has a clear decision criterion.
   Under vague decision criteria, the new procedure loses its advantage in
   interpretability, but is still more accurate than PCA/logit in targeting
   households.

AB Computing the optimal portfolio policy of an investor facing capital
   gains tax is a challenging problem: because the tax to be paid depends
   on the price at which the security was purchased (the tax basis), the
   optimal policy is path dependent and the size of the problem grows
   exponentially with the number of time periods. Dammon et al. (2001,
   2002, 2004), Garlappi et al. (2001), and Gallmeyer et al. (2001) address
   this problem by approximating the exact tax basis by the weighted
   average purchase price. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show
   that the structure of the problem has several attractive features that
   can be exploited to determine the optimal portfolio policy using the
   exact tax basis via nonlinear programming. Second, we characterize the
   optimal portfolio policy in the presence of capital gains tax when using
   the exact tax basis. Third, we show that the certainty equivalent loss
   from using the average tax basis instead of the exact basis is very
   small: it is typically less than 1% for problems with up to 10 periods,
   and this result is robust to the choice of parameter values and to the
   presence of transaction costs, dividends, intermediate consumption,
   labor income, tax reset provision at death, and wash-sale constraints.

   over time. The average public accounting firm experienced a productivity
   growth of 9.5% between 1995 and 1999. We find support for the hypothesis
   that technical progress rather than an improvement in relative
   efficiency was the reason for this productivity growth. Firms that were
   early movers into management advisory services (MAS) and those that
   emphasized growth in MAS over growth in the traditional audit and tax
   services enjoyed significantly higher productivity growth than their

   Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series models.
   Given an ARIMA model of consumer demand and the lead times at each
   stage, it is shown that the orders and inventories at each stage are
   also ARIMA, and closed-form expressions for these models are given.
   The paper also discusses the causes of the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon
   in which variation in demand produces larger variations in upstream
   orders and inventory. This discussion reveals how different modeling can
   lead to different insights because they make different assumptions about
   the cause of the bullwhip effect. These observations are used to develop
   managerial insights about reducing the bullwhip effect.

AB This paper presents an equilibrium explanation for the persistence of
   naive bidding. Specifically, we consider a common value auction in which
   a "naive" bidder (who ignores the winner's curse) competes against a
   fully rational bidder. We show that the naive bidder earns higher
   equilibrium profits than the rational bidder when the signal
   distribution is symmetric and unimodal. We then consider a sequence of
   such auctions with randomly selected participants from a population of
   naive and rational bidders, with the proportion of bidder types in the
   population evolving in response to. their relative payoffs in the
   auctions. We show that the evolutionary equilibrium contains a strictly
   positive proportion of naive bidders. Finally, we consider more general
   examples in which a naive bidder matched against a rational bidder does
   (i) worse than his rational opponent, but (ii) better than a rational
   bidder matched against another rational bidder. Again, the evolutionary
   equilibrium contains a strictly positive proportion of naive bidders.
   The results suggest that overconfident recent entrants in Internet and
   other low transaction-cost auctions of items that appeal to a mass
   audience may earn higher payoffs than their experienced competitors and,
   thus, will not eventually be driven from the market.

AB We present a formal model of haggling between a name-your-own-price
   retailer and a set of individual buyers. Rather than posting a price,
   the retailer waits for potential buyers to submit offers for a given
   product and then chooses to either accept or reject them. Consumers
   whose offers have been rejected can invest in additional haggling effort
   and increment their offers. This pricing model allows the
   name-your-own-price retailer to engage in price discrimination: As
   haggling is costly for the potential buyer, customers with a high
   willingness to haggle will achieve lower transaction prices. However,
   because haggling is costly, it reduces overall welfare and diminishes
   the benefits of price discrimination. Our study is motivated by several
   name-your-own-price retailers that have recently emerged on the
   Internet. Based on detailed transaction data of a large German
   name-your-own-price retailer, we present a model of consumer haggling.
   We then show how this model can be used to improve the decision making
   of the retailer, who needs to choose a threshold price above which all
   offers are accepted. Another decision variable for the retailer lies in
   the user interface design, which allows the retailer to either
   facilitate or to hinder the haggling of the consumer.

AB E-commerce has proved to be fertile ground for new business models,
   which may be patented (for up to 20 years) and have potentially
   far-reaching impact on the e-commerce landscape. One such electronic
   market is the reverse-auction model popularized by Priceline com. There
   is still uncertainty surrounding the survival of such new electronic
   markets currently available on the Internet. Understanding user behavior
   is necessary for better assessment of these sites' survival. This paper
   adds to economic analysis a formal representation of the emotions evoked
   by the auction process, specifically, the excitement of winning if a bid
   is accepted, and the frustration of losing if it is not. We generate and
   empirically test a number of insights related to (1) the impact of
   expected excitement at winning, and frustration at losing, on bids
   across consumers and biddings scenarios; and (2) the dynamic nature of
   the bidding behavior-that is, how winning and losing in previous bids
   influence their future bidding behavior.

AB Theorists have long believed that Dutch auctions are strategically
   equivalent to standard sealed bidding. However, in recent controlled
   experiments with actual Dutch and sealed-bid Internet auctions of
   collectibles, the Dutch auctions produced significantly more revenue. We
   believe that this happened, in part, because the Internet Dutch auctions
   are a slow process in which bidders incur incremental transaction costs
   if they delay bidding. This paper presents models of slow Dutch auctions
   that include these costs and explain this belief. We first present a
   decision-theoretic model of a slow Dutch auction. While simple, the
   decision-theoretic model is fairly general and provides the basic
   intuition underlying our revenue results. We then develop a
   game-theoretic model of a slow Dutch auction. We derive two symmetric,
   payoff-equivalent equilibria of the game in the absence of a cost of
   return and then consider the more general case of costly return. When
   the cost of return is in an appropriate range, the seller's expected
   revenue is an increasing function of that cost.

AB Combinatorial auctions where bidders can bid on bundles of items' can
   lead to more economically efficient allocations, but determining the
   winners is NP-complete and inapproximable. We present CABOB, a
   sophisticated optimal search algorithm for the problem. It uses
   decomposition techniques, upper and lower, bounding (also across
   components), elaborate and dynamically chosen bid-ordering heuristics,
   and a host of structural observations. CABOB attempts to capture
   structure in any instance. without making assumptions about the instance
   distribution. Experiments against the fastest prior algorithm, CPLEX
   8.0, show that CABOB is often faster, seldom drastically slower, and in
   many cases drastically faster-especially in cases with structure.
   CABOB's search runs in linear space and has significantly better anytime
   performance than CPLEX We also uncover interesting aspects of the
   problem itself. First, problems with short bids, which were hard for the
   first generation of specialized algorithms, are easy. Second, almost all
   of the CATS distributions are easy, and the run time is virtually
   unaffected by the number of goods. Third, we test several random restart
   strategies, showing that they do not help on this problem-the run-time
   distribution does not have a heavy tail.

AB W hen combinatorial bidding is permitted in auctions, such as the
   proposed FCC Auction #31, the resulting full valuations and
   winner-determination problem can be computationally challenging. We
   present a branch-and-price algorithm based on a set-packing formulation
   originally proposed by Dietrich and Forrest (2002, "A column generation
   approach for combinatorial auctions," in Mathematics of the Internet:
   E-Auction and Markets. The IMA, Volumes in Mathematics and Its
   Applications Vol. 127, Springer-Verlag, New York, 15-26). This
   formulation has a variable for, every possible combination of winning
   bids for. each bidder. Our algorithm exploits the structure of the
   XOR-of-OR bidding language used by the FCC. We also present a new
   methodology to produce realistic test problems based on the
   round-by-round results of FCC Auction #4. We generate 2,639 test
   problems, which involve 99 items and are substantially larger than most
   of the previously used benchmark problems. Because there are no
   real-life test problems for combinatorial spectrum auctions with the
   XOR-of-OR language, we used these test problems to observe the
   computational behavior of our algorithm. Our algorithm can solve all but
   one test problem within 10 minutes, appears to be very robust, and for
   difficult instances compares favorably to the natural formulation solved
   using a commercial optimization package with default settings.
   Although spectrum auctions are used as the guiding example to S describe
   the merits of branch and price for combinatorial. auctions, our approach
   applies to auctions of multiple goods in other scenarios similarly.

AB In combinatorial auctions, multiple distinct items are sold
   simultaneously and a bidder may place a single bid on a set (package) of
   distinct items. The determination of packages for bidding is a
   nontrivial task, and existing efficient formats require that bidders
   know the set of packages and/or their valuations. In this paper, we
   extend an efficient ascending combinatorial auction mechanism to use
   approximate single-item pricing. The single-item prices in each round
   are derived from a linear program that is constructed to reflect the
   current allocation of packages. Introduction of approximate single-item
   prices allows for endogenous bid determination where bidders can
   discover packages that were not included in the original bid set. Due to
   nonconvexities, single-item prices may not exist that are exact marginal
   values. We show that the use of approximate single-item prices with
   endogenous bidding always produces allocations that are at least as
   efficient as those from bidding with a fixed set of packages based on
   package pricing. A network resource allocation example is given that
   illustrates the benefits of our endogenous bidding mechanism.

   auction design for an important special case of the multiattribute
   allocation problem with special (preferential independent) additive
   structure on the buyer value and seller costs. Auction ADDITIVE&DISCRETE
   provides a refined design for a price-based auction in. which the price
   feedback decomposes to an additive part with a price for each attribute
   and an aggregate part that appears as a price discount for each
   supplier. In addition, this design also has excellent information
   revelation properties that are validated through computational
   experiments. The auction terminates with an outcome of a modified
   Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. This paper also develops Auction
   NONLINEAR&DISCRETE for the more general nonlinear case-a particularly
   simple design, that solves the general multiattribute allocation
   problem, but requires that the auctioneer maintains prices on bundles of

AB This paper develops a framework for analyzing business-to-business (B2B)
   transactions and supply chain management based on integrating contract
   procurement markets with spot markets using capacity options and
   forwards. The framework is motivated by the emergence of B2B exchanges
   in several industrial sectors to facilitate such integrated contract and
   spot procurement. In the framework developed, a buyer and multiple
   sellers may either contract for delivery in advance (the "contracting"
   option) or they may buy and sell some or all of their input/output in a
   spot market. Contract pricing involves both a reservation fee per unit
   of capacity and an execution fee per unit of output if capacity is
   called. The key question addressed is the structure of the optimal
   portfolios of contracting and spot market transactions for the buyer and
   these sellers, and the pricing thereof in market equilibrium. Existence
   and structure of market equilibria are characterized for the associated
   competitive game between sellers with heterogeneous technologies, under
   the assumption that they know the buyer's demand function. This allows
   an explicit characterization of the price of capacity options and the
   value of managerial flexibility, as well as providing conditions under
   which B2B exchanges are efficient and sustainable.

   considerable supply chain cost savings can be achieved if production and
   transportation costs are considered simultaneously. However, the,buyer's

AB Them from traditional channels. The interaction between firms operating
   across these differentiated channels involves interesting competitive
   dynamics that cannot be captured by isolated models of electronic
   markets. This paper develops a stylized spatial differentiation model to
   examine the impact of differences in channel flexibility, network
   externalities, and switching costs on competition between online,
   traditional, and hybrid firms. A basic model highlighting the moderating
   influence of the hybrid firm on both channels is extended to account for
   differential network externalities. and switching costs across the two
   channels. Our analysis indicates that while network effects as well as
   switching costs lead to the tipping of markets, such tipping occurs
   primarily due to the moderating effects of the competing channel. More
   importantly, with network effects an increased market share does not
   translate into higher profits. Contradictory to conventional wisdom, our
   results indicate that in a static market, consumers father than firms,
   benefit from increasing network externalities,, with competitive effects
   outweighing the surplus-extraction abilities of firms. Our results also
   highlight the importance of alternative revenue streams and provide
   insights for firms grappling with issues of channel choice as well as
   integration and divestiture.

AB We examine the impact of reduced search costs on prices of commodity
   products in electronic marketplaces. Conventionally, reduced consumer
   search costs may be expected to engender stronger price competition
   between firms, resulting in lower prices and improved consumer welfare.
   This notion was formalized in Stahl (1989, "Oligopolistic pricin with
   sequential consumer search," American Economic Review, Vol. 79, No. 4,
   pp. 700-712) in a model Of static firm competition. In this paper, we
   show that these standard welfare conclusions may be neutralized or
   reversed in a dynamic environment. We focus on self-enforcing collusion
   by firms and characterize the conditions under which collusive
   equilibria exist. We show that less costly consumer search can
   facilitate firms' abilities to collude, resulting in higher prices and
   reduced consumer welfare, even with imperfect or no monitoring by
   sellers of each other's prices. If the same technology that eases
   consumer search also allows,firms to monitor each other's prices more
   easily, then firms can more easily detect cheating on a collusive price
   arrangement, allowing an even greater scope for collusion. This raises
   antitrust concerns with respect to the electronic marketplace and
   suggests, that at least some of the anticipated competitive gains from
   electronic market systems may be difficult to realize.

AB The trust-building process is basic to social science. We investigate it
   in a laboratory setting using a novel multistage trust game where social
   gains are achieved if players trust each other in each stage. In each
   stage, also, players have an opportunity to appropriate these gains or
   be trustworthy by sharing them. Players are strangers because they do
   not know the identity of others and, they will not play them again.
   Thus, there is no prospect of future interaction to induce trusting
   behavior, and, we study the trust-building process where there is little
   scope for social relations and networks.
   Standard game theory, which assumes all players are opportunistic and
   untrustworthy and thus should have zero trust for others, is used to
   construct a null hypothesis. We test whether people are trusting or
   trustworthy and examine how inferring the intentions of those who trust
   affects trustworthiness. We also investigate the effect of stake on
   trust, and study the evolution of trust.
   Results show subjects exhibit some degree of trusting behavior, although
   a majority of them are not trustworthy and claim the entire social gain.
   Players are more reluctant to trust in later stages than in earlier ones
   and are more trustworthy if they are certain of the trustee's intention.
   Surprisingly, subjects are more trusting and trustworthy when the stake
   size increases. Finally, we find the subpopulation that invests in
   initiating the trust-building process modifies its trusting behavior
   based on the relative fitness of trust.

AB An increasing number of manufacturers have started to pursue a strategy
   that promotes inventory sharing among the dealers in their distribution
   network. In this paper we analyze a decentralized dealer network in
   which each independent dealer is given the flexibility to share his
   inventory. We model inventory sharing as a multiple demand classes
   problem in which each dealer faces his own customer demand with high
   priority, and inventory-sharing requests from other dealers with low
   priority. Assuming that each dealer uses a base-stock and
   threshold-rationing policy for his inventory-stocking and
   inventory-sharing decisions, we explicitly model the interactions
   between the dealers through inventory sharing and obtain a closed-form
   cost function for each dealer based on the steady-state distribution of
   the inventory levels at the two dealers. We then provide a detailed
   supermodularity analysis of the inventory-sharing and
   inventory-rationing game in which each dealer has a two-dimensional
   strategy set (stocking level and rationing level). We show that the
   full-sharing game (in which dealers precommit to sharing all of their
   on-hand inventory) and the fixed-sharing-level game (in which dealers
   precommit to sharing a portion of their on-hand inventory) are
   supermodular, and thus a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed to
   exist. For the rationing game (in which dealers precommit to their
   stocking levels), we show that there exists a dominant strategy
   equilibrium on the dealers' sharing (rationing) levels. Finally, a
   comprehensive computational study is conducted to highlight the impact
   of the manufacturer's incentives, subsidies, and/or transshipment fees
   on the dealers' sharing behavior.

   service levels, demand and production time variability, and structure of

   contracts causes the wholesale price to increase and the volatility of
   the retail price to decrease. In general, options are not zero-sum
   games. Conditions are derived under which the manufacturer prefers to
   use options. When this happens the retailer is also better off, if the
   uncertainty in the demand curve is low. However, if the uncertainty is

AB We study oligopoly price competition between multiproduct firms-firms
   whose products interact in the profit function. Specifically, we focus
   on the impact of intrafirm product interactions on the level of
   equilibrium profits. This impact may be decomposed in two different
   ways: (a) a direct effect (keeping the competitors' actions fixed) plus
   a strategic effect (i.e., through the competitors' actions); or,
   alternatively, (b) a competitive advantage effect (change in firm i
   only) plus an imitation effect (change in all other firms). We derive
   conditions such that (a) the strategic effect more than outweighs the
   direct effect, and conditions such that (b) the imitation effect more
   than outweighs the competitive advantage effect: Bertrand supertraps.
   For example, an increase in the degree of economies of scope would
   increase profits if prices were fixed or if the change were limited to
   firm i's cost function. However, if all firms increase the degree of
   economies of scope then all firms receive lower profits. A variety of

AB Motivated by applications in the computer and food catering service
   industries, we study an integrated scheduling model of production and
   distribution operations. In this model, a set of jobs (i.e,, customer
   orders) are first processed in a processing facility (e.g.,
   manufacturing plant or service center) and then delivered to the
   customers directly without intermediate inventory. The problem is to
   find a joint schedule of production and distribution such that an
   objective function that takes into account both customer service level
   and total distribution cost is optimized. Customer service level is
   measured by a function of the times when the jobs are delivered to the
   customers. The distribution cost of a delivery shipment consists of a
   fixed charge and a variable cost proportional to the total distance of
   the route taken by the shipment. We study two classes of problems under
   this integrated scheduling model. In the first class of problems,
   customer service is measured by the average time when the jobs are
   delivered to the customers; in the second class, customer service is
   measured by the maximum time when the jobs are delivered to the
   customers. Two machine configurations in the processing facility-single
   machine and parallel machine-are considered. For each of the problems
   studied, we provide an efficient exact algorithm, or a proof of
   intractability accompanied by a heuristic algorithm with worst-case and
   asymptotic performance analysis. Computational experiments demonstrate
   that the heuristics developed are capable of generating near-optimal
   solutions. We also investigate the possible benefit of using the
   proposed integrated model relative to a sequential model where
   production and distribution operations are scheduled sequentially and
   separately. Computational tests show that in many cases a significant
   benefit can be achieved by integration.

AB Recent approaches to modeling the client's payment-scheduling problem
   allow the client to control both the timing of payments and the
   completion times of activities. In practice, the activity schedule is
   typically determined by the contractor rather than the client. This
   paper addresses this drawback by considering a model in which the client
   selects the payment activities and the contractor selects the activity
   schedule, each to maximize his own net present value (NPV). In addition,
   the contractor has the option to reject the project if it does not
   provide a minimum NPV. The new model is shown to be NP-hard in the
   strong sense and a branch-and-bound procedure is provided for its
   solution. Results are obtained for the new model that contradict those
   of the older models. The benefits to the client are no,longer increasing
   with retention and no longer decreasing with the number of payments.
   Furthermore, it is no longer ideal for the client to focus payments at
   the beginning and end of the project. Empirical evidence based on a
   randomly generated data set suggests that the market for the
   contractor's services, the timing of benefits received by the client,
   and the project duration drive these new results.

   variation by examining Internet adoption decisions in a very large
   sample of organizations in the finance and services sector in 1998.
   I show how prior information technology (IT) investments land workplace
   organization decisions affect the returns to adopting simple and complex
   Internet technologies. I show that recent investments in client/server
   (C/S) networking applications have competing effects on the likelihood
   of Internet adoption. Such investments can slow adoption by acting as a
   short-run substitute or by creating "switching costs." Geographic
   dispersion of employees is complementary with Internet adoption,
   suggesting that Internet technology lowered internal coordination costs.
   Increases in organization size and external pressure also increase the
   likelihood of adoption.

   uncertain cost factor by two competing firms seeking to price a new
   product. We show that existing findings regarding the acquisition of
   demand information or the acquisition of either cost or demand
   information related to quantity decisions do not extend to this case.
   For cost information with price competition, the information acquisition
   strategies are strategic substitutes, even though the price decisions
   that are based on the information are strategic complements. Competition
   decreases the expected value of cost information. Moreover, when
   competition is intense and the cost of information low, identical firms
   do not acquire the same amount of cost information - even when
   information is free. Cost uncertainty acts like a "fog" that lessens the
   destructive effect of price competition when products are close
   substitutes, and thus increases expected profits. Buyers, on the other
   hand, are better off when competing firms are informed about cost. Even
   though the expected value of cost information strictly decreases with
   competition, the optimal price for industry-specific cost information
   set by an information vendor increases with competition when the firms'
   products are sufficiently substitutable.

   13.88% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not
   quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches.
   During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating
   income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve. We also find
   that it does not matter who caused the glitch, what the reason was for
   the glitch, or what industry a firm belongs to-glitches are associated
   with negative operating performance across the board.

AB Statistical volatility models rely on the assumption that the shape of
   the conditional distribution is fixed over time and that it is only the
   volatility that varies. The recently proposed conditional autoregressive
   value at risk (CAViaR) models require no such assumption, and allow
   quantiles to be modeled directly in an autoregressive framework.
   Although useful for risk management, CAViaR models do not provide
   volatility forecasts. Such forecasts are needed for several other
   important applications, such as option pricing and portfolio management.
   It has been found that, for a variety of probability distributions,
   there is a surprising constancy of the ratio of the standard deviation
   to the interval between symmetric quantiles in the tails of the
   distribution, such as the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles. This result has
   been used in decision and risk analysis to provide an approximation of
   the standard deviation in terms of quantile estimates provided by
   experts. Drawing on the same result, we construct financial volatility
   forecasts as simple functions of the interval between CAViaR forecasts
   of symmetric quantiles. Forecast comparison, using five stock indices
   and 20 individual stocks, shows that the method is able to outperform
   generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models
   and moving average methods.

AB Software vulnerability disclosure has become a critical area of concern
   for policyrnakers. Traditionally, a Computer Emergency Response Team
   (CERT) acts as an infomediary between benign identifiers (who
   voluntarily report vulnerability information) and software users. After
   verifying a reported vulnerability CERT sends out a public advisory so
   that users can safeguard their systems against potential exploits.
   Lately, firms such as Defense have been implementing a new market-based
   approach for vulnerability information. The market-based infomediary
   provides monetary rewards to identifiers for each vulnerability
   reported. The infomediary then shares this information with its client
   base. Using this information, clients protect themselves against
   potential attacks that exploit those specific vulnerabilities.
   The key question addressed in our paper is whether movement toward such
   a market-based mechanism for vulnerability disclosure leads to a better
   social outcome. Our analysis demonstrates that an active unregulated
   market-based mechanism for vulnerabilities almost always underperforms a
   passive CERT-type mechanism. This counterintuitive result is attributed
   to the market-based infomediary's incentive to leak the vulnerability
   information inappropriately. If a profit-maximizing firm is not allowed
   to (or chooses not to) leak vulnerability information, we find that
   social welfare improves. Even a regulated market-based mechanism
   performs better than a CERT-type one, but only under certain conditions.
   Finally, we extend our analysis and show that a proposed
   mechanism-federally funded social planner-always performs better than a
   market-based mechanism.

AB Although initial use is an important indicator of information system
   (IS) success, it does not necessarily lead to the desired managerial
   outcome unless the use continues. However, compared with the great
   amount of work done on IS adoption, little systematic effort has gone
   into providing insight into continued IS use over time. The objective of
   this study is to develop a longitudinal model of how users' evaluations
   and behavior evolve as they gain experience with the information
   technology application. The proposed model is a unified framework that
   sheds light on four different mechanisms underlying postadoption
   phenomena: (1) the processes suggested by the technology acceptance
   model; (2) sequential updating mechanisms; (3) feedback mechanisms; and
   (4) repeated behavioral patterns. The proposed model was empirically
   tested in the context of Web-based IS use in a nonexperimental setting.
   Our findings suggest that, as hypothesized, each of the four theoretical
   viewpoints is essential for a deeper understanding of continued IS use.
   We discuss important findings that emerged from this longitudinal study
   and suggest directions for additional research.

AB This paper examines whether interpersonal networks help explain two
   widely documented patterns of knowledge diffusion: (1) geographic
   localization of knowledge flows, and (2) concentration of knowledge
   flows within firm boundaries. I measure knowledge flows using patent
   citation data, and employ a novel regression framework based on
   choice-based sampling to estimate the probability of knowledge flow
   between inventors of any two patents. As expected, intraregional and
   intrafirm knowledge flows are found to be stronger than those across
   regional or firm boundaries. I explore whether these patterns can be
   explained by direct and indirect network ties among inventors, as
   inferred from past collaborations among them. The existence of a tie is
   found to be associated with a greater probability of knowledge flow,
   with the probability decreasing as the path length (geodesic) increases.
   Furthermore, the effect of regional or firm boundaries on knowledge flow
   decreases once interpersonal ties have been accounted for. In fact,
   being in the same region or firm is found to have little additional
   effect on the probability of knowledge flow among inventors who already
   have close network ties. The overall evidence is consistent with a view
   that interpersonal networks are important in determining observed
   patterns of knowledge diffusion.

   concentrated in those areas where it chooses to recombine knowledge,
   offering support for the path-dependent evolution of capabilities. We
   test this theory by analyzing the R&D networks in DuPont, a highly

AB A well-studied problem in the literature on airline revenue (or yield)
   management is the optimal allocation of seat inventory among fare
   classes, given a demand distribution for each class. In practice, the
   seat allocation decisions of one airline affect the passenger demands
   for seats on other airlines. In this paper, we examine the seat
   inventory control problem under both horizontal competition (two
   airlines compete for passengers on the same flight leg) and vertical
   competition (different airlines fly different legs on a multileg
   itinerary). Such vertical competition can be the outcome of a
   code-sharing agreement between airlines, because each airline sells
   seats on the partner airlines' flights but the airlines are unwilling,
   or unable, to coordinate yield management decisions. We provide a
   general sufficient condition under which a pure-strategy Nash
   equilibrium exists in these revenue management games, and we also
   compare the total number of seats available in each fare class with, and
   without, competition. Analytical results as well as numerical examples
   demonstrate that more seats are protected for higher-fare passengers
   under horizontal competition than when a single airline acts as a
   monopoly. Under vertical competition the booking limit may be higher or
   lower, however, than the monopoly level, depending on the demand for
   connecting flights in each fare class. Finally, we discuss
   revenue-sharing contracts that coordinate the actions of both airlines.

AB We investigate the role of potential weekly brand-specific
   characteristics that influence consumer choices, but are unobserved or
   unmeasurable by the researcher. We use an empirical approach, based on
   the estimation methods used for standard random coefficients logit
   models, to account for the presence of such unobserved attributes. Using
   household scanner panel data, we find evidence that ignoring such
   time-varying latent (to the researcher) characteristics can lead to two
   types of problems. First, consistent with previous literature, we find
   that these unobserved characteristics may lead to biased estimates of
   the mean price response parameters. This argument is based on a form of
   price endogeneity. If marketing managers set prices based on consumer
   willingness to pay, then the observed prices will likely be correlated
   with the latent (to the researcher) brand characteristics. We resolve
   this problem by using an instrumental variables procedure. Our findings
   suggest that simply ignoring these attributes may also lead to larger
   estimates of the variance in the heterogeneity distribution of
   preferences and price sensitivities across households. This could
   overstate the benefits from marketing activities such as household-level
   targeting. We resolve the problem by using weekly brand intercepts,
   embedded in a random coefficients brand choice model, to control for
   weekly brand-specific characteristics, while accounting for household
   heterogeneity. Overall, our results extend the finding on the
   endogeneity bias from the mean of the heterogeneity distribution (i.e.,
   the price effect) to include the variance of that distribution.

AB Information technology can link geographically separated people and help

   potential to bridge gaps and unite communities. Paradoxically, they also
   have the potential to fragment interaction and divide groups. Advances
   in technology can make it easier for people to spend more time on

   boundaries can thus be supplanted by boundaries on other dimensions.
   This paper formally defines a precise set of measures of information
   integration and develops a model of individual knowledge profiles and
   community affiliation. These factors suggest specific conditions under
   which improved access, search, and screening can either integrate or
   fragment interaction on various dimensions. As IT capabilities continue
   to improve, preferences-not geography or technology-become the key
   determinants of community boundaries.

AB Learning by doing represents an important mechanism through which
   organizations prosper. Some firms, however, learn from their experience
   at a dramatic rate, while other firms exhibit very little learning at
   all. Three factors have been identified that affect the rate at which
   firms learn: (a) the proficiency of individual workers, (b) the ability
   of firm members to leverage knowledge accumulated by others, and (c) the
   capacity for coordinated activity inside the organization. Each factor
   varies with a particular kind of experience. An increase in cumulative
   individual experience increases individual proficiency An increase in
   cumulative organizational experience provides individuals with the
   opportunity to benefit from knowledge accumulated by others. An increase
   in cumulative experience working together promotes more effective
   coordination and teamwork. To gain insight into factors responsible for
   the learning curve, we examine the contribution of each kind of
   experience to performance, while controlling for the impact of the other
   two. The study context is a teaching hospital. The task is a total joint
   replacement procedure, and the performance metric is procedure
   completion time. We find that each kind of experience makes a distinct
   contribution to team performance. We discuss the implications of our
   findings for the learning-by-doing framework in general, and learning in
   the team context in particular.

AB An extensive empirical literature has demonstrated the existence of.
   density-dependent selection in organizational vital rates. This research
   has also shown that historical trajectories followed by organizational
   populations only partly conform to the predictions of the original
   model. Inconsistencies with the model's predictions prompt a series of
   questions: Why do organizational populations suddenly, collapse after
   reaching a peak? Why do organizational populations oscillate after
   collapsing? What causes extinction of organizational forms? To address
   these questions, scholars have proposed a variety of modifications to
   the original model of density dependence. All have merit, but none is
   completely satisfying. The main objective of this study is to narrow the
   gap between theories, models, and observed historical trajectories by
   identifying a unitary analytical framework that can account for the
   variety of empirical trajectories typically followed by mature
   organizational populations. The model that we present is based on the
   hypothesis of system-dependent selection, according to which patterns of
   resource availability are produced by processes that are partly
   endogenous to organizational populations. The main analytical insight of
   the study is that under conditions of dynamic resource constraints
   introduced by system-dependent selection, the,presence of
   population-level inertia leads to a rich variety of historical
   trajectories during population maturity. We show that this result holds
   in the absence of any particular assumption about the microstructure of
   organizational populations. Possible trajectories include sustained
   oscillations, resurgence, and extinction.

AB Arguing that GAAP is ill suited for estimating the future profitability
   of intangibles, the accounting literature (e.g., Kaplan and Norton 1996,
   Lev 2001) has recently proposed alternative measurement models. These
   models view intangibles as composed of a set of fundamental business
   activities and use multiple financial and nonfinancial metrics causally
   interlinked to profits to represent this view. Using a unique and
   proprietary cross-sectional data set of the retail banking industry, we
   provide some of the first tests on the empirical validity of such
   measurement models. We characterize the core deposit intangible, an
   important retail banking intangible representing a bank's relationships
   with its customers, using financial and nonfinancial metrics on price,
   service, customer usage, and customer satisfaction. We find that the
   metrics do not individually predict future earnings, but gain individual
   significance in a collective setting, increasing the predictive power
   substantially. We argue that this result occurs because the activities
   underlying the measures are causally interlinked to profits and
   explicitly illustrate these linkages with a structural path model. Our
   measurement model also predicts significant interactive effects in the
   way our measures are informative about future profits, and we document
   such effects, not just among the individual measures, but also across
   the measures and environmental factors such as the bank's strategy. In
   sum, our measurement model illustrates the key drivers, measures, and
   interactions in retail banking customer relationships.

AB We introduce a simple game between two rival firms-a leader and a
   follower, where the leader moves first and makes an operational choice
   under uncertainty. The leader's disclosure of its resulting financial
   success or failure may in turn give the follower a competitive advantage
   by informing its operational choice. When this occurs, the leader reacts
   by sometimes making an operational choice that it knows to be less
   likely to produce operational success than the alternative. This makes
   the financial report less useful to the follower and expected financial
   success more likely for the leader. Alternatively, when the financial
   report does not provide useful information to the follower (e.g., the
   financial report aggregates many activities in addition to the activity
   the follower is interested in), it may be the follower rather than the
   leader who makes the choice less likely to be operationally successful.
   We document that when trading off operational success for financial
   success, the leader's aim is operational unpredictability, while the
   follower's aim is coordination. As such, this paper highlights the
   intricate interplay between internal operational decisions, public
   inferences concerning those decisions, and different forms of success
   under intense competition.

   occurrence of treatment errors. Four safety climate dimensions have been
   identified. They include employee perceptions of the suitability of the
   organization's safety procedures for their daily work, employee
   perceptions of the frequency and the clarity of the safety information
   distributed by the organization; the way employees interpret their
   managers' safety practices, and the perceived priority given to safety
   within the organization. The study was conducted in 21 medical units in
   a general hospital and the results were cross-validated in 15 units in
   another hospital. Results demonstrated that perceived suitable safety
   procedures and frequent and clear information flow reduced treatment
   errors only when managers practiced safety and through their influence
   on the level of priority given to safety within the unit. Implications
   for safety climate theory and for reducing the occurrence of treatment
   errors by safety interventions are discussed.

AB In this paper we study how the time-series structure of the demand
   process affects the value of information sharing in A supply chain. We
   consider a two-stage supply chain model in which a retailer serves
   auto-regressive moving-average (ARMA) demand and a manufacturer fills
   the retailer's orders. We characterize three types of situations based
   on the parameters of the demand process: (i) the manufacturer benefits
   from inferring demand. information from the retailer's orders; (ii) the
   manufacturer cannot infer demand, but benefits from sharing demand
   information; and (iii) the manufacturer is better off neither inferring
   nor sharing, but instead uses only the most recent orders in its
   production planning. Using the example of ARMA(l,l) demand, we find that
   sharing or inferring retail demand leads to a 16.0% average reduction in
   the manufacturer's safety-stock requirement in cases (i) and (ii), but
   leads to an increase in the manufacturer's safety-stock requirement in
   (iii). Our results apply not only to two-stage but also to multistage
   supply chains.

AB We study how differences in product demand characteristics affect the
   strategic value of different types of supply chain flexibility for
   accurate response. We propose a single-period inventory modelling
   framework, with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects
   updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on supply chain
   flexibility. We consider two complementary forms of flexibility:
   quantity flexibility in production and timing flexibility in scheduling.
   In this framework, we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm for
   alternate demand types. We model functional products through the
   standard assumption of independent demand over the period,.
   fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model, and
   innovative products with evolving demand through a Martingale process.
   The three demand processes exhibit very different behavior with respect
   to the value of the alternate forms of flexibility. We observe that
   quantity flexibility is of moderate value for functional goods and of
   high value for fashion-driven products for all lead times. Quantity
   flexibility is of low value for goods with evolving demand with long
   lead times but of high value for short lead times. Alternately, we
   observe timing flexibility is of highest value for functional goods,
   especially for cases of high holding cost, and is of lesser value for
   fashion-driven goods. It is of least value for goods with evolving
   demand. Both quantity and timing flexibility capabilities are required
   to significantly reduce the relevant supply chain costs for
   evolving-demand innovative goods when the lead times are long.

AB The practice of offering discounts to prospective customers represents a
   rudimentary form of using transaction history measures to customize the
   marketing mix. Furthermore, the proliferation of powerful, customer
   relationship management (CRM) systems is providing the data and the
   communications channels necessary to extend this type of pricing
   strategy into true dynamic marketing policies that adjust pricing as
   customer relationships evolve. In this paper, we describe a dynamic
   programming-based approach to creating optimal relationship pricing
   policies. The methodology has two main components. The first component
   is a latent class logit model that is used to model customer buying
   behavior. The second component is a dynamic optimization procedure that
   computes profit-maximizing price paths. The methodology is illustrated
   using subscriber data provided by a large metropolitan newspaper.
   The empirical results provide support for the common managerial practice
   of offering discounts to new customers. However, in contrast to current
   practice, the results suggest the use of a series of decreasing
   discounts based on the length of customer tenure rather than a single
   steep discount for first-time purchasers. The dynamic programming (DP)
   methodology also represents an important approach to calculating
   customer value (CV). Specifically, the DP framework allows the
   calculation of CV to be an explicit function,of marketing policies and
   customer status. As such, this method for calculating CV accounts for
   the value of managerial flexibility and improves upon existing methods
   that do not model revenue and attrition rates as functions of marketing
   variables.

AB Expert judgment is, frequently used to assess parameter values of
   quantitative management science models, particularly in decision-making
   contexts. Experts can, however, only be expected to assess observable
   quantities, not abstract model parameters. This means that we need a
   method for translating expert assessed uncertainties on model outputs
   into uncertainties on model parameter values. This process is called
   probabilistic inversion. The probability distribution on model
   parameters obtained in this way can be used in a variety of ways, but in
   particular in an uncertainty analysis or as a Bayes prior. This paper
   discusses computational algorithms that have proven successful in
   various projects and gives examples from environmental modelling and
   banking. Those algorithms are given a theoretical basis by adopting a
   minimum information approach to modelling, partial information. The role
   of minimum information is two-fold: It enables us to resolve the
   problem, of nonuniqueness of distributions given the information we
   have, and it provides numerical stability to the algorithm by
   guaranteeing convergence properties.

AB Better targeting opportunities and the increasing role of
   information-intensive environments have created new challenges for firms
   in obtaining customer information. Such information can help firms
   increase their profits through cross-selling opportunities. However,
   revealing personal preferences and contact information can raise the
   risks for customers when dealing with a firm. Consequently, some
   customers trade off the benefit and risks of revealing information. As
   the opportunity to obtain a higher level of information increases,
   customers incur a higher level of risk when dealing with a firm. This
   increases the firm's incentive to commit on a cross-selling level. By
   such a commitment, a firm can obtain customer intimacy and benefit from
   detailed customer information. As a result, profits increase while
   prices decrease. Thus, legal regulations that explicitly require firms
   to spell out the extent of cross-selling may actually improve the
   profits of the firm.

AB The ISO 9000 series of quality management systems standards, introduced
   in 1986, has been adopted at over 560,000 locations worldwide. Anecdotal
   evidence suggests that firms can achieve internal benefits such as
   quality or productivity improvements or that certification can help
   firms maintain or increase their market share, or both. Others argue
   that the standard is too generic to cause performance improvement but
   can be seen as a signal of good management. In this paper, we track
   financial performance from 1987 to 1997 of all publicly traded ISO 9000
   certified manufacturing firms in the United States with SIC codes
   2000-3999, and test whether ISO 9000 certification leads to productivity
   improvements, market benefits, and improved financial performance. We
   employ event-study methods, matching each certified firm to a control
   group of one or more noncertified firms in the same industry with
   similar precertification size and/or return on assets. We find that
   firms' decision to seek their first ISO 9000 certification was indeed
   followed by significant abnormal improvements in financial performance,
   though the exact timing and magnitude of this effect depend on the
   specification of the control group. Three years after certification, the
   certified firms do display strongly significant abnormal performance
   under all control-group specifications. The degree to which the precise
   results vary across control-group specifications indicates that event
   studies should always include extensive sensitivity analysis, for
   instance matching by size and performance separately and jointly, using
   both single firms and portfolios as controls.

AB We present two results concerning soybean prices. First, we exhibit a
   simple relationship between stocks and price volatility The observation
   of an increasing price volatility with decreasing inventory is often
   mentioned in the literature, but has so far been documented using a
   proxy for inventory (see Fama and French 1987, 1988; Litzenberger and
   Rabinowitz 1995). Instead, we reconstruct a yearly, quarterly, and
   monthly database of worldwide soybean inventories using aggregate data
   from the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. We show that under all
   time scales, price volatility is an increasing linear function of
   inverse inventory, which we term "scarcity." Second, we show how the
   addition of the factor scarcity in a state-variable approach to the
   dynamics of the term structure of soybean forward prices improves the
   quality of the fit. We document this property on a 25-year database of
   CBOT futures contracts and show that the superior accuracy also affects
   long-maturity futures contracts, an important property for the valuation
   of long-term origination contracts between producing countries and the
   agrifood industry.

AB Motivated by an aggregate production-planning problem in an actual
   global manufacturing network, we, examine the impact of exchange-rate
   uncertainty on the choice of optimal production policies when the
   allocation decision can be deferred until the realization of exchange
   rates. This leads to the formulation of the problem as a two-stage
   recourse program whose optimal policy structure features two forms of
   flexibility denoted as operational hedging: (1) production hedging,
   where the firm deliberately produces less than the total demand; and (2)
   allocation hedging, where due to unfavorable exchange rates, some
   markets are not served despite having unused production. Our
   characterization of the optimal policy structure leads to an economic
   valuation of production and allocation hedging. We show that the
   prevalence of production hedging is moderated by the degree of
   correlation between exchange rates. A comprehensive examination under
   the following four generalized settings provides the depth, scope, and
   relevancy that our proposed operational hedges play to facilitate
   aggregate planning: (1) multiple periods, (2) demand uncertainty, (3)
   price setting or monopolistic pricing, and (4) price setting under
   demand uncertainty. We show that production and allocation hedging are
   robust for these generalizations and should be integrated into the
   overall aggregate planning strategy of a global manufacturing firm.

AB We develop an analytical framework to investigate the competitive
   implications of personalized pricing (PP), whereby firms charge
   different prices to different consumers based on their willingness to
   pay We embed PP in a model of vertical product differentiation and show
   how it affects firms' choices over quality. We show that firms' optimal
   pricing strategies with PP may be non-monotonic in consumer valuations.
   When the PP firm has high quality; both firms raise their qualities
   relative to the uniform pricing case. Conversely, when the PP firm has
   low quality, both firms lower their qualities. Although many firms are
   trying to implement such pricing policies, we find that a higher-quality
   firm can actually be worse off with PP. While it is optimal for the firm
   adopting PP to increase product differentiation, the non-PP firm seeks
   to reduce differentiation by moving in closer in the quality space.
   While PP results in a wider market coverage, it also leads to aggravated
   price competition between firms. Because this entails a change in
   equilibrium qualities, the nature of the cost function determines
   whether firms gain or lose by implementing such PP policies. Despite the
   threat of first-degree price discrimination, we find that PP with
   competing firms can lead to an overall increase in consumer welfare.

AB Promotional tools such as rebates and coupons are usually seen as
   different ways of price discriminating among consumers. We focus on a
   different property of rebates: their ability to price discriminate
   within a consumer among her postpurchase states. Unlike price
   discrimination between consumers, this property is unique to rebates
   because, by design, they are redeemed after the purchase. (Coupons, by
   contrast, are redeemed with the purchase.) The consumer redeems the
   rebate only in postpurchase states in which her marginal utility of
   income is high. This selective redemption behavior provides an
   opportunity for the seller to "utility arbitrage," directing discounts
   to when they matter most, resulting in an increase in the consumer's
   up-front willingness to pay. In turn, this enables an increase in the
   regular price. Of course, rebates can still price discriminate among
   consumers. Indeed, their ability to deliver state-dependent discounts
   may enhance their overall price discrimination ability, as we show in an
   example comparing them to coupons.

   computational challenges in determining the individual discriminatory
   transfer payments. We propose an alternative uniform-price,
   computationally efficient, revenue-maximizing knapsack formulation
   called the Multiple Vickrey Auction.(MVA). While not incentive
   compatible, the MVA mechanism achieves bounded posterior regret and can
   be solved in real time. It has the added benefit of realizing imputed

   discriminatory GVA approach. For service providers that are concerned
   about the incentive compatibility but want imputed service prices, we
   suggest a maximal MVA (mMVA) uniform-pricing scheme that trades off
   revenue maximization for allocative efficiency. For sake of completeness
   we discuss the properties of a first-price pay-your-bid scheme. While
   NP-hard and not incentive compatible, this formulation has the perceived
   benefit of cognitive simplicity on the parts of sellers and bidders.

   general supply chain design. This paper proposes a novel solution
   methodology for this problem that is based on Lagrangean relaxation,
   interior-point methods, and branch and bound. Unlike classical
   approaches, Lagrangean relaxation is applied in a two-level hierarchy,
   branch and bound is based on a Lagrangean lower bound and column
   generation (branch and price), while interior-point methods are used
   within a cutting-plane context (analytic centre cuttingplane
   method-ACCPM). Numerical results demonstrate that the two-level approach
   outperforms the classical approach and provides a very sharp lower bound
   that is the (proven) optimal in most cases.

AB We address how to configure the supply chain for a new product for which
   the design has already been decided. The central question is to
   determine what suppliers, parts, processes, and transportation modes to
   select at each stage in the supply chain. There might be multiple
   options to supply a raw material, to manufacture or assemble the
   product, and to transport the product to the customer. Each of these
   options is differentiated by its lead time and direct cost added. Given
   these various choices along the supply chain, the configuration problem
   is to select the options that minimize the total supply chain cost. We
   develop a dynamic program with two state variables to solve the supply
   chain configuration problem for supply chains that are modeled as
   spanning trees. We illustrate the problem and its solution with an
   industrial example. We use the example to show the benefit from
   optimization relative to heuristics and to form hypotheses concerning
   the structure of optimal supply chain configurations. We conduct a
   computational experiment to test these hypotheses.

AB Every marketer's dream is to create a "hot product" that customers would
   absolutely want to have, thus generating considerable profit to the
   marketer. According to one school of thought, marketers should make
   products hard to get in order to create really hot products. In this
   paper, using a game-theoretic model, we investigate if such scarcity
   strategies can indeed be optimal. While a scarcity strategy may appear
   to be a viable approach for making a firm's product successful, further
   analysis raises some puzzling issues. In particular, it is not clear why
   a firm would not increase its price to get demand and supply in sync and
   increase its profit in the process. We therefore offer a signaling
   explanation for the optimality of such strategies and show that a
   high-quality seller may optimally choose to make the product scarce in
   order to credibly signal the quality of its product to uninformed
   customers. Our analysis indicates that a high-quality seller optimally
   employs scarcity as a signaling device in product markets that are
   characterized, ceteris paribus, by a small difference in marginal cost
   between high- and low-quality products, a low reservation price for a
   low-quality product, a greater heterogeneity in reservation prices for a
   high-quality product, and a moderate number of informed consumers. Our
   results provide a rationale for the fact that scarcity strategies are
   usually observed for discretionary or specialty products, but not for
   commodity products, staple products, or new-to-the-world products.

AB Remanufacturing is a production strategy whose goal is to recover the

   a lower cost than the initial production cost, but consumers value
   remanufactured products less than new products. The choice of production
   technology influences the value that can be recovered from a used
   product. In this paper, we solve the joint pricing and production
   technology selection problem faced by a manufacturer that considers
   introducing a remanufacturable product in a market that consists of
   heterogeneous consumers. Our analysis discusses the market and
   technology drivers of product remanufacturability and identifies some

AB In this paper, we consider whether an increase in uncertainty increases
   the value of a research and development (R&D) project, We also consider
   the related question of the impact of increased project uncertainty on
   the value of management flexibility, defined as the difference in value
   when the project is managed "actively" versus when it is under "passive"
   management. These questions have already been formulated in an
   insightful paper in the literature, where different sources of
   variability and uncertainty in R&D projects are identified and
   abandonment and improvement at interim stages are considered as options
   that provide management flexibility. We follow the same formulation. We
   derive a set of negative results that are contrary to the results of the
   above-mentioned paper and a set of positive results that are different
   from those presented. Our negative results indicate that when the source
   of variability is development uncertainty or market requirement
   uncertainty, one cannot make a general statement about the impact of
   increased uncertainty. In some cases, the value of flexibility (and
   project value) increases and in others it decreases. On the other hand,
   if the source of variability is market payoff, we show that increased
   variability increases either the overall project value or the project
   option value. If the increased variability of market payoff increases
   the "passive" value of the project, the overall project value also
   increases; and if it decreases the "passive" value, the value of
   flexibility, i.e., the project option value, increases.

   maintaining customers' interest. Despite the importance of websites as
   the major and, at times, sole channel of communication in e-business,
   little theoretical knowledge is available about how websites may
   influence online shoppers' attitudes and behavior. In this paper, we
   develop a conceptual framework for measuring the impact of Web-design
   elements on the beliefs and behavior of Web customers. In developing the
   theoretical model (called the belief reinforcement model, or BRM), we
   synthesize the theory of planned behavior with theories in social
   psychology, consumer behavior, and management to categorize Web-design
   elements and conceptualize the salient aspects of Web shoppers'
   behavior. The empirical examination of BRM indicates that various
   categories of Web-design elements reinforce Web customers' beliefs,
   which in turn positively impact attitudinal constructs that lead to
   changes in their purchase intentions. BRM and its results provide an
   initial guideline for a rigorous approach to designing websites for
   e-business and testing their effectiveness before their full deployment.

AB This study examines coordination issues that occur in allocating
   spending between advertising and information technology (IT) in
   electronic retailing. Electronic retailers run the risk of overspending
   on advertising to attract customers but underspending on IT, thus
   resulting in inadequate processing capacity at the firm's website. In
   this paper, we present a centralized, joint marketing-IT model to
   optimally allocate spending between advertising and IT, and we discuss
   an uncoordinated case where marketing and IT make suboptimal advertising
   and capacity decisions. We show how these decisions can be coordinated
   either by reducing the value of a customer session or by designing an
   optimal processing contract between marketing and IT, Both the
   coordination methods can be implemented with only local knowledge of the
   IT function, yet they generate a solution that almost matches the
   quality of the centralized solution. We extend our basic model to
   consider demand uncertainty, lagged advertising effects, and
   uncertainties in the lead time to acquire IT capacity. With demand
   uncertainty, electronic retailers should reduce spending on advertising
   and increase IT capacity if there is potential for a demand upswing and
   the cost of IT capacity is relatively low. The value of a customer
   session should be further reduced when uncertainties exist. This is
   required to share the risk of excess or inadequate IT capacity.

AB This paper considers an inventory system with an assembly structure. In
   addition to uncertain customer demands, the system experiences uncertain
   returns from customers. Some of the components in the returned products
   can be recovered and reused, and these units are returned to inventory.
   Returns complicate the structure of the system, so that the standard
   approach (based on reduction to an equivalent series system) no longer
   applies in general. We identify conditions on the item-recovery pattern
   and restrictions on the inventory policy under which an equivalent
   series system does exist. For the special case where only the end
   product (or all items used to assemble the end product) is recovered, we
   show that the system is equivalent to a series system with no policy
   restrictions. For the general case, we explain how and why the system
   becomes more problematic and propose two heuristic policies, The
   heuristics are easy to compute and practical to implement, and they
   perform well in numerical trials. Based on these numerical trials, we
   obtain insights into the impact of various factors on system
   performance. For example, we find that holding and backorder costs tend
   to increase when the average return rate, the variability of returns, or
   the number of components recovered increases, However, neither the
   product architecture nor the specific set of components being recovered
   seems to have a significant impact on these costs. Whether product
   recovery reduces total system costs depends on the magnitude of the
   additional holding and backorder costs relative to potential procurement
   cost savings.

   case, the buyer's quality is observable, whereas in the double
   moral-hazard case, the buyer's quality is not observable. The supplier's
   quality is not observable in both the single and double moral-hazard
   cases. In each case, we examine a warranty/penalty contract between the
   buyer and the supplier based on information from incoming inspection and
   external failures. When the warranty contract is based on information
   from external failures in the single moral-hazard case, the first-best
   quality is achieved, whereas in the double moral-hazard case, the
   first-best quality is achieved if the supplier is not held responsible
   for the buyer's defects. When the warranty contract is based on
   information from incoming inspection, the first-best is achieved in both
   the single and double moral-hazard cases, even when the incoming
   inspection does not identify all of the supplier's defectives. An
   analysis of whether the penalty on the supplier in each case meets a
   fairness criterion-that is, the penalty does not exceed the
   manufacturer's external failure cost-indicates that the fairness
   criterion is met by the warranty contract based on information from
   incoming inspection when the first-best incoming inspection is
   sufficiently high. However, if the first-best incoming inspection is low
   and the precision of pinpointing the supplier's responsibility for
   external failure is sufficiently high, the warranty contract based on
   external failures could satisfy the fairness criterion.

AB It has been recognized that when a durable goods manufacturer sells its
   output, it has an incentive to produce at a rate that will drive down
   the market price of the product over time. Because anticipation of
   declining prices makes consumers less willing to invest in owning the
   durable good, selling can be self-defeating for the manufacturer. If the
   manufacturer instead leases the product, it can eliminate its own
   incentive to decrease the price over time, which allows it to extract
   larger rents from consumers. In this paper, we investigate how a durable
   goods manufacturer's choice between leasing and selling is affected by a
   complementary product that is produced by an independent firm. We show
   that a durable goods manufacturer that leases its product has an
   incentive to increase prices (by limiting the availability of the
   product) in response to the availability of a complement. Because this
   potential for opportunistic behavior discourages output of the
   complement, leasing can also be problematic. As a result, the durable
   goods manufacturer faces a trade-off between leasing, which commits the
   manufacturer to not overproduce, and selling, which commits it to not
   underproduce. Our contribution is to identify this trade-off and show
   how a durable goods manufacturer can use a combination of leasing and
   selling to balance its strategic commitment across both its own market
   as well as the complementary market.

AB T he analysis of a risky project should take into account not only
   uncertainties about the return from that project ("project risk"), but
   also uncertainties associated with other ongoing projects and with
   exogenous factors that can impact final wealth ("background risk"). The
   presence of background risk can change the optimal course of action with
   respect to a project, and ignoring such risk might lead to a poor
   decision. Most work on background risk assumes that project risk and
   background risk are independent and are additive in their impact on
   wealth. However, independence is often unrealistic, and background risk
   operates in a multiplicative manner in many situations. We relax the
   independence assumption and consider a model with both additive and
   multiplicative background risk. The optimal decisions in the correlated
   setting can be very different than those that would appear optimal if
   the correlation were ignored. The impact of correlation differs in the
   additive and multiplicative cases, with positive correlation being
   beneficial in some cases and negative correlation in others. The
   analytical and numerical results indicate that in analyzing
   decision-making problems, it is very important to understand the
   direction and degree of dependence between project risk and background
   risks.

   predicted the modal choice in the other 13. New versions of three other

   shaping interpersonal dynamics. Sharing a demographic characteristic has
   been shown to strengthen a relationship between people. The initial
   explanation for this positive effect emphasized the importance of
   individual preferences for social contact. Similar people share common
   interests, which makes them more attractive as exchange partners. More
   recent explanations have highlighted the important role of
   identification and competition. Identification increases the tendency
   for strong ties to develop among similar people, while competition
   reduces that tendency I argue that tie strength is a function of all
   three mechanisms: a baseline level of interpersonal attraction, a
   positive identification effect, and a negative competition adjustment.
   Identification and competition vary with the number of people sharing
   the focal attribute to define a predictable association between sharing
   the focal attribute and the strength of a network connection.
   Predictions are tested with tenure and tie-strength data from a small
   research and development firm. Analysis indicates that having the same
   tenure has the predicted effect on communication frequency. The
   implications of the findings are discussed for homophily research in
   particular and demography research in general.

AB This paper reports the results of an experimental parameter-free
   elicitation and decomposition of decision weights under uncertainty.
   Assuming cumulative prospect theory, utility functions were elicited for
   gains and losses at an individual level using the tradeoff method.
   Subsequently, decision weights were elicited through certainty
   equivalents of uncertain two-outcome prospects. Furthermore, decision
   weights were decomposed using observable choice instead of invoking
   other empirical primitives, as in previous experimental studies. The
   choice-based elicitation of decision weights allows for a quantitative
   study of their characteristics, and also allows, among other things, for
   the examination of the sign-dependence hypothesis for observed choice
   under uncertainty. Our results confirm concavity of the utility function
   in the gain domain and bounded subadditivity of decision weights and
   choice-based subjective probabilities. We also find evidence for sign
   dependence of decision weights.

AB In this paper, we develop a stylized partially observed Markov decision
   process (POMDP) framework to study a dynamic pricing problem faced by
   sellers of fashion-like goods. We consider a retailer that plans to sell
   a given stock of items during a finite sales season. The objective of
   the retailer is to dynamically price the product in a way that maximizes
   expected revenues. Our model brings together various types of
   uncertainties about the demand, some of which are resolvable through
   sales observations. We develop a rigorous upper bound for the seller's
   optimal dynamic decision problem and use it to propose an
   active-learning heuristic pricing policy We conduct a numerical study to
   test the performance of four different heuristic dynamic pricing
   policies in order to gain insight into several important managerial
   questions that arise in the context of revenue management.

AB Decision and risk analysts have considerable discretion in designing
   procedures for eliciting subjective probabilities. One of the most
   popular approaches is to specify a particular set of exclusive and
   exhaustive events for which the assessor provides such judgments. We
   show that assessed probabilities are systematically biased toward a
   uniform distribution over all events into which the relevant state space
   happens to be partitioned, so that probabilities are "partition
   dependent." We surmise that a typical assessor begins with an "ignorance
   prior" distribution that assigns equal probabilities to all specified
   events, then adjusts those probabilities insufficiently to reflect his
   or her beliefs concerning how the likelihoods of the events differ. In
   five studies, we demonstrate partition dependence for both discrete
   events and continuous variables (Studies I and 2), show that the bias
   decreases with increased domain knowledge (Studies 3 and 4), and that
   top experts in decision analysis are susceptible to this bias (Study 5).
   We relate our work to previous research on the "pruning bias" in
   fault-tree assessment (e.g., Fischhoff et al. 1978) and show that
   previous explanations of pruning bias (enhanced availability of events
   that are explicitly specified, ambiguity in interpreting event
   categories, and demand effects) cannot fully account for partition
   dependence. We conclude by discussing implications for decision analysis
   practice.

AB The authors propose a new approach for measuring, analyzing, and
   predicting a brand's equity in a product market. Brand equity is defined
   as the incremental contribution ($) per year obtained by the brand in
   comparison to the underlying product (or service) with no brand-building
   efforts. The incremental contribution is driven by the individual
   customer's incremental choice probability for the brand in comparison to
   his choice probability for the underlying product with no brand-building
   efforts. The approach takes into account three sources of brand
   equity-brand awareness, attribute perception biases, and nonattribute
   preference-and reveals how much each of the three sources contributes to
   brand equity. This is done by taking into account not only the direct
   effects of these three sources on choice probabilities, but also the
   indirect effects through enhancing the brand's availability. The method
   provides what-if analysis capabilities to predict the likely impacts of
   alternative strategies to enhance a brand's equity The survey-based
   results from applying the method to the digital cellular phone market in
   Korea show that the proposed approach has good face validity and
   convergent validity, with brand awareness playing the largest role,
   followed by nonattribute preference.

AB Consumers purchase conspicuous goods to satisfy not only material needs
   but also social needs such as prestige. In an attempt to meet these
   social needs, producers of conspicuous goods like cars, perfumes, and
   watches, highlight the exclusivity of their products. In this paper, we
   propose a monopoly model of conspicuous consumption using the rational
   expectations framework, and then examine how purchase decisions are
   affected by the desire for exclusivity and conformity. We show that
   snobs can have an upward-sloping demand curve but only in the presence
   of consumers who are (weakly) followers. Laboratory tests lend support
   for this model prediction and for the rational expectations framework.
   The experimental results suggest that subjects. used some degree of
   sophisticated thinking to arrive at their first-period decisions. Their
   behavior in the subsequent trials, however, can be adequately captured
   by a purely adaptive learning mechanism. We discuss the implications of
   consumer learning for optimal dynamic pricing policy by a monopolist.

AB Financial theory posits that capital markets convey through stock prices
   their expectation of the firm's future performance. We use concepts from
   principal-agent theory and prospect theory to provide a theoretical
   explanation for the role stock price variation plays in managerial
   decision making. We then empirically investigate what specific decisions
   managers undertake in response to stock price variation. We perform our
   empirical analyses in the context of the pharmaceutical industry. We
   find that drug firms whose stock underperformed the industry react
   differently than drug firms with high-performing stocks. Specifically,
   laggards tend to implement more changes to their current product
   portfolio and distribution than high-performing firms. The more laggards
   underperform, the more they implement acquisitions aimed to produce
   immediate improvement in the firm's product portfolio. In contrast, drug
   firms whose stocks outperform the industry tend to make fewer changes to
   their current portfolio and distribution. Instead, they focus more on
   long-term research and development and marketing of existing products.
   We interpret these findings in light of industry key success factors.

AB With declining costs of distributing digital products comes renewed
   interest in strategies for pricing goods with low marginal costs. In
   this paper, we evaluate customized bundling, a pricing strategy that
   gives consumers the right to choose up to a quantity M of goods drawn
   from a larger pool of N different goods for a fixed price. We show that
   the complex mixed-bundle problem can be reduced to the customized-bundle
   problem under some commonly used assumptions. We also show that, for a
   monopoly seller of low marginal cost goods, this strategy outperforms
   individual selling (M = 1) and pure bundling (M = N) when goods have a
   positive marginal cost or when customers have heterogeneous preferences
   over goods. Comparative statics results also show that the optimal
   bundle size for customized bundling decreases in both heterogeneity of
   consumer preferences over different goods and marginal costs of
   production. We further explore how the customized-bundle solution is
   affected by factors such as the nature of distribution functions in
   which valuations are drawn, the correlations of values across goods, and
   the complementarity or substitutability among products. Altogether, our
   results suggest that customized bundling has a number of advantages-both
   in theory and practice-over other bundling strategies in many relevant
   settings.

AB How can firms profitably give away free products? This paper provides a
   novel answer and articulates trade-offs in a space of information
   product design. We introduce a formal model of two-sided network
   externalities based in textbook economics-a mix of Katz and Shapiro
   network effects, price discrimination, and product differentiation.
   Externality-based complements, however, exploit a different mechanism
   than either tying or lock-in even as they help to explain many recent
   strategies such as those of firms selling operating systems, Internet
   browsers, games, music, and video.
   The model presented here argues for three simple but useful results.
   First, even in the absence of competition, a firm can rationally invest
   in a product it intends to give away into perpetuity. Second, we
   identify distinct markets for content providers and end consumers and
   show that either can be a candidate for a free good. Third, product
   coupling across markets can increase consumer welfare even as it
   increases firm profits.
   The model also generates testable hypotheses on the size and direction
   of network effects while offering insights to regulators seeking to
   apply antitrust law to network markets.

AB Motivated by a $2.2 billion inventory write-off by Cisco Systems, we
   investigate how duplicate orders can lead a manufacturer to err in
   estimating the demand rate and customers' sensitivity to delay, and to
   make faulty decisions about capacity investment. We consider a
   manufacturer that sells through two distributors. If a customer finds
   that his distributor is out of stock, then he will sometimes seek to
   make a purchase from the other distributor; if the latter is also out of
   stock, the customer will order from both distributors. When his order is
   filled by one of the distributors, the customer cancels any duplicate
   orders. Furthermore, the customer cancels all of his outstanding orders
   after a random period of time.
   Assuming that the manufacturer is unaware of duplicate orders, we prove
   that she will overestimate both the demand rate and the cancellation
   rate. Surprisingly, failure to account for duplicate orders can cause
   short-term underinvestment in capacity. However, in long-term
   equilibrium under stable demand conditions the manufacturer overinvests
   in capacity. Our results suggest that Cisco's write-off was caused by
   estimation errors and cannot be blamed entirely on the economic
   downturn. Finally, we provide some guidance on estimation in the
   presence of double orders.

   the use of transshipment to pool inventory, we develop a formal model
   that focuses on the role of transshipment in a system of n-retailers who
   stock a good. In addition, some stock may be kept at a warehouse. If a
   retailer faces a stockout, he makes an attempt to fill backorders by
   using a transshipment that may come either from the warehouse or from
   another retailer that has excess stock. We determine that the optimal
   transshipment policy is described by exactly one of five protocols, and
   that the choice among them can be made by evaluating a set of easily
   computable conditions. We also provide other structural results that
   help identify conditions under which a warehouse should be open: how
   this decision is influenced by the total number of retailers, and how
   this decision is related to the degree of correlation of demand between
   retailers.

   cases of the general hub arc location model are examined in detail. We
   provide motivation for the new models, and present examples and optimal
   solutions, using data for U.S. air passenger traffic. Results are used
   to compare optimal costs, hub locations, and hub arc locations with
   corresponding hub median optimal solutions. The results reveal
   interesting spatial patterns and help identify promising cities and
   regions for hubs. A companion paper (Campbell et al. 2005) presents
   integer programming formulations and solution algorithms for the new hub
   arc problems. It also provides details and computation times for these
   solution algorithms.

   whether the system of inspections and penalties set by the regulator is
   effective. The second is whether a better system of inspections and

   which the regulator must function. We study these issues in the context
   of oil spill prevention activities of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), the
   agency entrusted with the enforcement of maritime pollution laws. A
   theoretically optimal contract that mixes penalties based on the amount
   of pollution ex post with penalties based on the extent of noncompliance
   ex ante is derived. The effectiveness of USCG inspections and penalties
   in reducing oil spills is then econometrically studied using microlevel
   data on a panel of U.S. flag tank vessels. Whether the optimal penalty
   can potentially improve the effectiveness of compliance inspections in
   reducing oil spills is examined in the light of the empirical results
   and recent developments in the economics and public management
   literature on effective incentive contracting. Among our findings is the
   potential for combining unilateral incentive-based methods with
   cooperative methods based on reciprocity to solve the complex problem of

   collected from boundary-spanning service employees organized in 60 teams
   and their customers, our findings reveal a significant positive impact
   of group potency on customer-perceived service quality and a negative
   effect on service profitability. In addition, we find that team
   consensus regarding group potency positively moderates the effects of
   group potency, so that for teams with higher levels of potency
   consensus, the positive impact of group potency on customer-perceived
   service quality is stronger, whereas the negative impact of group
   potency on service productivity is weaker. Furthermore, we find
   significant positive effects of management and interteam support and
   functional diversity as well as a significant negative effect of team
   tenure on individual team member beliefs of group potency Finally,
   social support consensus moderates the effects of management support,
   interteam. support, and team tenure on group potency, so that the
   effects of these antecedents are weaker for teams with higher levels of
   social support consensus. Thus, we conclude that team confidence
   consensus increases the positive impact of group potency on customer
   perceptions of service quality and decreases the negative impact on
   profitability. Thus, team-member perceptual agreement on their team's
   potency should be stimulated.

AB There are two sources of agency costs under moral hazard: (1)
   distortions in incentive contracts and (2) implementation of suboptimal
   decisions. In the accounting literature, the relation between
   conservative accounting and agency costs of type (1) has received
   considerable attention (cf. Watts 2002). However, little appears to be
   known about the effects of accounting conservatism on agency costs of
   type (2) or trade-offs between agency costs of types (1) and (2). The
   purpose of this study is to examine this void. In a principal-agent
   setting in which the principal motivates the agent to expend effort
   using accounting earnings, this study shows that accounting earnings
   become more useful for reducing agency costs of type (2) when measured
   conservatively than when measured aggressively. Combined with the result
   in Kwon et al. (2001) that agency costs of type (1) decrease with
   accounting conservatism, this analysis suggests that conservative
   accounting enhances the incentive value of accounting signals with
   respect to both types of agency costs.

AB Step-level models of reasoning (SLR) proved to be very successful in
   predicting behavior in the beauty contest game. Recently, a quantified
   version of the model was suggested as a more general model of thinking.
   In particular, it was found that, the distribution of choices could be
   represented by a Poisson distribution. I test the model in stylized
   first- and second-price common-value sealed-bid auctions. Equilibrium,
   for both auction types, prescribes that players undercut each other and
   profits are small. The SLR prediction, on the other hand, is different
   for the two auctions. Nash equilibrium predicts the outcomes poorly; the
   SLR model predicts the outcomes well in the second-price auction.
   However, while bids in the first-price auction could be represented by a
   Poisson distribution, this could not be attributed to step-level
   reasoning.

AB Monte Carlo simulation is widely used to measure the credit risk in
   portfolios of loans, corporate bonds, and other instruments subject to
   possible default. The accurate measurement of credit risk is often a
   rare-event simulation problem because default probabilities are low for
   highly rated obligors and because risk management is particularly
   concerned with rare but significant losses resulting from a large number
   of defaults. This makes importance sampling (IS) potentially attractive.
   But the application of IS is complicated by the mechanisms used to model
   dependence between obligors, and capturing this dependence is essential
   to a portfolio view of credit risk. This paper provides an IS procedure
   for the widely used normal copula model of portfolio credit risk. The
   procedure has two parts: One applies IS conditional on a set of common
   factors affecting multiple obligors, the other applies IS to the factors
   themselves. The relative importance of the two parts of the procedure is
   determined by the strength of the dependence between obligors. We
   provide both theoretical and numerical support for the method.

AB We study the convergence of Monte Carlo estimators of derivatives when
   the transition density of the underlying state variables is unknown.
   Three types of estimators are compared. These are respectively based on
   Malliavin derivatives, on the covariation with the driving Wiener
   process, and on finite difference approximations of the derivative. We
   analyze two different estimators based on Malliavin derivatives. The
   first one, the Malliavin path estimator, extends the path derivative
   estimator of Broadie and Glasserman (1996) to general diffusion models.
   The second, the Malliavin weight estimator, proposed by Fournie et al.
   (1999), is based on an integration by parts argument and generalizes the
   likelihood ratio derivative estimator. It is shown that for
   discontinuous payoff functions, only the estimators based on Malliavin
   derivatives attain the optimal convergence rate for Monte Carlo schemes.
   Estimators based on the covariation or on finite difference
   approximations are found to converge at slower rates. Their asymptotic
   distributions are shown to depend on additional second-order biases even
   for smooth payoff functions.

AB We consider the problem of maximizing an expected utility function of n
   assets, such as the mean-variance or power-utility function. Associated
   with a change in an asset's holdings from its current or target value is
   a transaction cost. This cost must be accounted for in practical
   problems. A straightforward way of doing so results in a 3n-dimensional
   optimization problem with 3n additional constraints. This higher
   dimensional problem is computationally expensive to solve. We present a
   method for solving the 3n-dimensional problem by solving a sequence of
   n-dimensional optimization problems, which accounts for the transaction
   costs implicitly rather than explicitly. The method is based on deriving
   the optimality conditions for the higher-dimensional problem solely in
   terms of lower-dimensional quantities. The new method is compared to the
   barrier method implemented in Cplex in a series of numerical
   experiments. With small but positive transaction costs, the barrier
   method and the new method solve problems in roughly the same amount of
   execution time. As the size of the transaction cost increases, the new
   method outperforms the barrier method by a larger and larger factor.

   combinatorial optimization problem with applications in distribution and
   production planning. A variety of lower bounds based on Lagrangean
   relaxation and subgradient optimization has been proposed for this
   problem. However, information about a primal (fractional) solution can
   be important to solve large or difficult problem instances. Therefore,
   we study various approaches for solving the master problems exactly The
   algorithms employ different strategies for stabilizing the
   column-generation process. Furthermore, a new lower bound for the CFLP
   based on partitioning the plant set and employing column generation is
   proposed. Computational results are reported for a set of large problem

AB We consider a model for a serial supply chain in which production,
   inventory, and transportation decisions are integrated in the presence
   of production capacities and concave cost functions. The model we study
   generalizes the uncapacitated serial single-item multilevel economic
   lot-sizing model by adding stationary production capacities at the
   manufacturer level. We present algorithms with a running time that is
   polynomial in the planning horizon when all cost functions are concave.
   In addition, we consider different transportation and inventory holding
   cost structures that yield improved running times: inventory holding
   cost functions that are linear and transportation cost functions that
   are either linear, or are concave with a fixed-charge structure. In the
   latter case, we make the additional common and reasonable assumption
   that the variable transportation and inventory costs are such that
   holding inventories at higher levels in the supply chain is more
   attractive from a variable cost perspective. While the running times of
   the algorithms are exponential in the number of levels in the supply
   chain in the general concave cost case, the running times are remarkably
   insensitive to the number of levels for the other two cost structures.

AB Mixed-integer Gomory cuts have become an integral part of
   state-of-the-art software for solving mixed-integer linear programming
   problems. Therefore, improvements in the performance of these cutting
   planes can be of great practical value. In this paper, we present a
   simple and fast heuristic for improving the coefficients on the
   continuous variables in the mixed-integer Gomory cuts. This is motivated
   by the fact that in a mixed-integer Gomory cut, the coefficient of an
   integer variable lies between 0 and 1, whereas for a continuous
   variable, there is no upper bound. The heuristic tries to reduce the
   coefficients of the continuous variables. We call the resulting cuts
   reduce-and-split cuts. We found that on several test problems,
   reduce-and-split cuts can substantially enhance the performance of a
   branch-and-bound algorithm.

AB Using an unusually comprehensive database on 858 transactions for
   information technology products and accompanying services, we study how
   close partners who are exposed to opportunistic hazards structure and
   control a significant transaction. We analyze data on the terms of
   contracting to determine whether transaction and supplier
   characteristics that generate opportunistic hazards are related to the
   formal management control structure. We also examine whether
   misalignment between transaction and supplier characteristics and the
   control structure is associated with ex post performance problems.
   Characteristics associated with hazards are found to be positively
   related to contract extensiveness. Factor analysis of the use of 24
   contract terms reveals four groups of contract terms that are commonly
   used in combination. We interpret these factors as "dimensions of
   management control" and label them: assignment of rights, product and
   price, after-sales service, and legal recourse. Characteristics
   associated with hazards are positively related to the use of all four
   dimensions of management control, with different hazards associated with
   different controls. We then examine the relation between transaction
   characteristics and ex post transaction problems, demonstrating that
   even in the presence of mutually agreeable contracts, hazards remain. We
   conclude that costs of contracting are associated with increased use of
   contract terms on assignment of rights, after-sales service, and legal
   recourse. Finally, we present evidence that management control
   structures that are better aligned with transaction hazards mitigate
   subsequent performance problems, though at a nontrivial cost of
   contracting.

AB The majority of reverse auctions for procurement use a single-attribute
   (price) format while providing constraints on nonprice attributes such
   as quality and lead time. Alternatively, a buyer could choose to conduct
   a multiattribute auction where bidders can specify both a price and
   levels of nonprice attributes. While such an auction may provide higher
   theoretical utility to the buyer, it is not clear that this theoretical
   improvement will be realized given the increased complexity of the
   auction. In this research, we present an ascending auction mechanism for
   a buyer whose utility function is known and dependent on three
   attributes. Motivated by a supply chain procurement problem setting, we
   consider quality and lead time for the two attributes in addition to
   price. The auction mechanism provides the bidders with restricted
   feedback regarding the buyer's utility function. We explore,
   experimentally, the performance of this multiattribute auction mechanism
   as compared to a price-only auction mechanism. Compared with the
   price-only auction, we find that our mechanism design is effective in
   increasing both buyer utility and bidder (supplier) profits.

AB One commonly held belief in designing auctions is that increasing the

   who wishes to minimize her procurement costs is better off inviting more
   suppliers to participate. In this paper, we question the validity of
   this belief by shedding light on bidders' behavior when bidders
   experience economies of scale in production and differ in their
   production capacity. We consider a setting with two different sized
   bidders, global and small. We assume that global bidders have a large
   production capacity (can win in more than one auction) and experience
   economies of scale in production, whereas small bidders can win in at
   most one auction. In this new setting, we focus on the impact of
   allowing both global and small suppliers to compete against each other
   on the performance of an auction.

AB Vagueness attitudes have been used to explain anomalies and
   irregularities in investment behavior. It is generally assumed (Ellsberg
   1961) that decision makers (DMs) dislike vagueness, but this assumption
   has been challenged by empirical results documenting systematic
   alternative attitudes to vagueness as a function of its source, the
   domain of the decisions, and the response mode used. We investigate
   these three factors in a within-subjects design that was embedded in an
   investment context. DMs evaluated investment options that varied in
   terms of their sources of vagueness (probabilities and/or outcomes), in
   both domains (gains or losses), and employed two response modes (pricing
   or choice). We confirm that individuals' vagueness attitudes are
   malleable, contingent on the dimension salience and the reference
   domain. In particular, we observed three distinct patterns of "reversals
   of attitudes" towards vagueness. Our results indicate that the ability
   of vagueness attitudes to predict investment behavior is limited, as
   decisions can be systematically influenced by task context and/or
   perceived gain or loss positions. Economic models may be improved by
   incorporating more flexible assumptions about individuals' attitudes
   toward vagueness.

   for R and Q are suggested and tested. Stochastic demand and purchase
   costs are considered, both with known systematic
   (business-cycle-related) risk.
   The systematic risk of stochastic demand has typically a negligible
   effect on the optimal values of R and Q, although an improvement may be
   achieved by a simple adjustment of R.
   The systematic risk of the purchase price, c, has a significant effect
   on R and Q. The capital holding cost should be estimated as r (.) c,
   where r is the sum of the risk-free interest rate, the expected price
   decrease, and the risk premium associated with the systematic risk of c.
   For goods quoted on commodity exchanges, r may be estimated directly
   from the prices on forward contracts. Its size (and sign) varies

   based on the concept of one stochastic dominant change preceding another

AB Network caches are the storage centers in the supply chain for content
   delivery-the digital equivalent of warehouses. Operated by access
   networks and other operators, they provide benefits to content
   publishers in the forms of bandwidth cost reduction, response time
   improvement, and handling of flash crowds. Yet, caching has not been
   fully embraced by publishers, because its use can interfere with site
   personalization strategies and/or collection of visitor information for
   business intelligence purposes. While recent work has focused on
   technological solutions to these issues, this paper provides the first
   study of the managerial issues related to the design and provisioning of
   incentive-compatible caching services. Starting with a single class of
   caching service, we find conditions under which the profit-maximizing
   cache operator should offer the service for free. This occurs when the
   access networks' bandwidth costs are high and a large fraction of
   content publishers value personalization and business intelligence. Some
   publishers will still opt out of the service, i.e., cache bust, as
   observed in practice. We next derive the conditions under which the
   profit-maximizing cache operator should provision two vertically
   differentiated service classes, namely, premium and best effort.
   Interestingly, caching service differentiation is different from
   traditional vertical differentiation models, in that the premium and
   best-effort market segments do not abut. Thus, optimal prices for the
   two service classes can be set independently and cannibalization does
   not occur. It is possible for the cache operator to continue to offer
   the best-effort service for free while charging for the premium service.

   consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the availability of

   the caches.

AB Given the difficulties people experience in making trade-offs, what are
   the consequences of using simple models that avoid trade-offs? We
   examine choices by such models in environments where "true" preferences
   are linear and attributes are characterized by binary attributes. A
   deterministic elimination-by-aspects (DEBA) model is highly effective
   over a range of conditions. When preferences are quite compensatory,
   however, a modified equal weighting (EW) model that uses DEBA to resolve
   ties is more effective. We explore the sensitivity of results to errors
   in using DEBA, to different distributions of alternatives, and to error
   in "true" preferences. Under the conditions examined here, the outcomes
   of these "boundedly rational" models are highly consistent with
   "rational" models that explicitly confront trade-offs. We emphasize the
   importance of binary attributes in reaching these conclusions.

AB In this paper, we study a serial two-echelon supply chain selling a
   procure-to-stock product in a price-sensitive market. Our analytical
   modelling framework incorporates optimal pricing and stocking decisions
   for both echelons in the presence of stochastic demand and random
   delivery times. We focus on understanding how these decisions for the
   chain are affected by its management paradigm (centralized or
   decentralized), and its business characteristics-price sensitivity,
   demand uncertainty, and delivery time variability. A novel combination
   of transformations enables us to analyze the framework and determine the
   unique optimal choices for centralized and wholesale price-based
   decentralized supply chains. More detailed investigation reveals that,
   in general, the business characteristics influence both the behavior and
   the optimal values of the decision variables, while the management
   paradigm primarily governs the optimal values. We illustrate the
   significance of these results in terms of how managers should tailor
   their decisions to align with their business requirements. Subsequently;
   comparison of the optimal profits between the channel partners and the
   management paradigms provides implications for decentralization
   strategy. A decentralized chain is most inefficient for moderately
   price-sensitive customers and uncertain environments, but is relatively
   more effective when dealing with mature products. We propose a
   contracting scheme that can improve the decentralized chain profit in
   reliable delivery time settings. The salient modelling insight of this
   paper is that ignoring the randomness of delivery time trivializes the
   interaction between pricing and stocking decisions. On the other hand,
   from a managerial viewpoint, we establish that optimal pricing policies
   provide the means to increase revenue and also act as strategic tools
   for tackling uncertainty.

AB The economical and environmental benefits of product remanufacturing
   have been widely recognized in the literature and in practice. In this
   paper, we focus on the interaction between a manufacturer's reverse
   channel choice to collect postconsumer goods and the strategic product
   pricing decisions in the forward channel when retailing is competitive.
   To this end, we model a direct product collection system, in which the
   manufacturer collects used products directly from the consumers (e.g.,
   print and copy cartridges) and an indirect product collection system, in
   which the retailers act as product return points (e.g., single-use
   cameras, cellular phones). We first examine how the allocation of
   product collection to retailers impacts their strategic behavior in the
   product market, and we discuss the economic trade-offs the manufacturer
   faces while choosing an optimal reverse channel structure. When a direct
   collection system is used, channel profits are driven by the impact of
   scale of returns on collection effort, whereas in the indirect reverse
   channel, supply chain profits are driven by the competitive interaction
   between the retailers. Subsequently, we show that the buy-back payments
   transfered to the retailers for postconsumer goods provide a wholesale
   pricing flexibility that can be used to price discriminate between
   retailers of different profitability

   two-period and multiperiod scenarios to identify thresholds in
   remanufacturing operations. Next, we focus our attention on the duopoly
   environment where an independent operator (10) may intercept cores of
   products made by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to sell
   remanufactured products in future periods. We characterize the
   production quantities associated with self-selection and explore the
   effect of various parameters in the Nash equilibrium. Among other
   results, we find that if remanufacturing is very profitable, the
   original-equipment manufacturer may forgo some of the first-period
   margin by lowering the price and selling additional units to increase
   the number of cores available for remanufacturing in future periods.
   Further, as the threat of competition increases, the OEM is more likely
   to completely utilize all available cores, offering the remanufactured
   products at a lower price.

AB Wireless number portability (WNP) is a telecommunication regulatory
   policy that requires cellular phone service providers to allow customers
   who switch service subscriptions to retain their original phone numbers.
   The right to retain the number lowers the switching cost for a consumer.
   Thus, the purpose of the policy is to induce more competition and
   facilitate the growth of new or small service providers. In this paper,
   we show that WNP drives market price downward as expected but with a
   surprising twist-rather than helping the smaller firms grow, the policy
   may accelerate the process of market concentration. We find that the
   main contributing factor to this peculiarity is the discriminatory
   pricing scheme prevalent in the industry-that is, a service provider
   charges a lower per-minute fee for the calls initiated and received
   within the same network than for the calls connected across two
   networks. Under this pricing scheme, a consumer who subscribes to a
   larger network would benefit more than if subscribing to a smaller
   network, despite the relatively higher fixed access fee that the former
   may charge. By lowering the barrier of switching, WNP creates a market
   condition conducive for a larger network to gain market share. We
   support our analysis with the empirical evidence gathered from Hong Kong
   where WNP was adopted in March 1999.

AB Manufacturing firms in capital-intensive industries face inherent demand
   volatility for their products and the inability to change their capacity
   quickly. To cope with these challenges, manufacturers often enter into
   contracts with their customers that offer greater certainty of supply in
   return for more predictable orders. In this paper, we study a
   "forecast-commitment" contract in which the customer provides a
   forecast, the supplier makes a production commitment to the customer
   based on the forecast, and the customer's minimum order quantity is a
   function of the forecast and committed quantities. We provide a complete
   analysis of the supplier's decisions when there is a single customer
   facing uncertain demand. We first show that the supplier has two
   dominant commitment strategies: committing to the forecast or committing
   to the production quantity. We then characterize the jointly optimal
   commitment and production strategy for the supplier and extend the
   results to consider a capacity constraint. We show that the proposed
   contract can moderate the supplier's motivation to underproduce, and due
   to the structure of the contract and the form of the supplier's optimal
   strategy, also limits the customer's incentive to overforecast. We also
   provide results for a capacitated two-customer example, which show that
   the supplier's choice of production quantity for each customer is not
   necessarily nondecreasing in the total available capacity.

AB Empirical research on complementarity between organizational design
   decisions has traditionally focused on the question of existence of
   complementarity. In this paper, we take a broader approach to the issue,
   combining a "productivity" and an "adoption" approach, while including a
   search for contextual variables in the firm's strategy that affects
   complementarity. Analysis of contextual variables is not only
   interesting per se, but also improves the productivity test for the
   existence of complementarity. We use our empirical methodology to
   analyze complementarity between innovation activities: internal research
   and development (R&D) and external knowledge acquisition. Our results
   suggest that internal R&D and external knowledge acquisition are
   complementary innovation activities, but that the degree of
   complementarity is sensitive to other elements of the firm's strategic
   environment. We identify reliance on basic R&D-the importance of
   universities and research centers as an information source for the
   innovation process-as an important contextual variable affecting
   complementarity between internal and external innovation activities.

AB The behavioral theory of the firm and prospect theory predict that
   performance below an aspiration level increases risk taking, but
   researchers also propose that performance below an aspiration level
   decreases risk taking. These conflicting predictions primarily hinge on
   whether decision makers perceive negative performance as a repairable
   gap or as a threat to firm survival. This study examines a boundary
   condition of these conflicting predictions. We argue that a firm's
   resource endowment affects decision makers' risk tolerance: Managers in
   firms with large stocks of resources are buffered from the threat of
   failure and conform to the prediction of greater risk taking in response
   to performance decreases; managers in firms with limited resources view
   low performance as a step closer to failure and decrease risk taking in
   response to performance decreases. Using data on the risky decision of
   factory expansion in shipbuilding firms and firm size as an indicator of
   the stock of tangible resources, we find that performance below the
   aspiration level reduces risk taking in small firms, but either does not
   affect risk taking or increases risk taking in large firms. These
   findings are largely consistent with our predictions and also suggest
   that large firms are more inert than small firms.

   derivative with arbitrary payoff function is converted to the pricing of
   a portfolio of European call options, leading to analytical expressions
   for those cases where analytical European call prices are available
   (e.g., the Merton jump-diffusion process). Furthermore, in many
   settings, the approach yields upper and lower analytical bounds that
   provably converge to the true option price. We provide computational
   results to illustrate the convergence and accuracy of the resulting

AB Averaging estimates is an effective way to improve accuracy when
   combining expert judgments, integrating group members' judgments, or
   using advice to modify personal judgments. If the estimates of two
   judges ever fall on different sides of the truth, which we term
   bracketing, averaging must outperform the average judge for convex loss
   functions, such as mean absolute deviation (MAD). We hypothesized that
   people often hold incorrect beliefs about averaging, falsely concluding
   that the average of two judges' estimates would be no more accurate than
   the average judge. The experiments confirmed that this misconception was
   common across a range of tasks that involved reasoning from summary data
   (Experiment 1), from specific instances (Experiment 2), and conceptually
   (Experiment 3). However, this misconception decreased as observed or
   assumed bracketing rate increased (all three studies) and when
   bracketing was made more transparent (Experiment 2). Experiment 4 showed
   that flawed inferential rules and poor extensional reasoning abilities
   contributed to the misconception. We conclude by describing how people
   may face few opportunities to learn the benefits of averaging and how
   misappreciating averaging contributes to poor intuitive strategies for
   combining estimates.

AB Linear programming-based estimation procedures are used in a variety of
   arenas. Two notable areas are multiattribute utility models (LINMAP) and
   production frontiers (data envelopment analysis (DEA)). Both LINMAP and
   DEA have theoretical and managerial advantages. For example, LINMAP
   treats ordinal-scaled preference data as such in uncovering
   individual-level attribute weights, while regression treats these
   preferences as interval scaled. DEA produces easy-to-understand
   efficiency measures, which allow for improved productivity benchmarking.
   However, acceptance of these techniques is hindered by the lack of
   statistical significance tests for their parameter estimates.
   In this paper, we propose and evaluate such parameter significance
   tests. Two types of tests are forwarded. The first examines whether a
   model's fit is significantly reduced when an explanatory variable is
   deleted. The second is based on generating a standard deviation or
   distribution for the parameter estimate using nonparametric jackknife or
   bootstrap techniques. We demonstrate through simulations that both types
   of tests reliably identify both significant and insignificant
   parameters. The availability of these tests, especially the relatively
   simple and easy-to-use tests of the first type, should enhance the
   utilization of linear programming-based estimation.

AB Subjective expected utility theory does not distinguish between
   attitudes toward uncertainty (ambiguous probabilities) and attitudes
   toward risk (unambiguous probabilities). Both are explained in terms of
   nonlinear utility for money rather than properties of events per se,
   hence, the decision maker displays the same attitude toward all sources
   of risk and uncertainty. There is ample evidence that real decision
   makers do not always behave (or even wish to behave) in this way, and
   instead they often distinguish between risk and uncertainty, as in
   Ellsberg's (1961) paradox. This paper presents a simple axiomatic model
   of nonneutral attitudes toward uncertainty and a behavioral test for
   uncertainty aversion that is applicable even if utility is state
   dependent. The decision maker may display different degrees of aversion
   toward gambles on different kinds of events, e.g., being systematically
   more averse toward gambles on events whose probabilities are more
   ambiguous. For such a decision maker, the elicitation of preferences
   among objective gambles may not yield the correct measure of risk
   aversion for modeling real-world decisions.

   rates: More confident actors are moved to start ventures, and then act
   on such confidence when deciding how to allocate resources in their
   ventures. Building on theory and evidence from the behavioral
   decision-making literature, we describe how founders' socially
   constructed confidence affects the manner in which they interpret
   information about their prior and current ventures. We then link
   founders' propensity to be overconfident to their decisions to allocate,
   use, and attain resources. In our model, founders with greater socially
   constructed confidence tend to deprive their ventures of resources and
   resourcefulness and, therefore, increase the likelihood that their

AB Recent theoretical and empirical research on cognitive bias in decision

   decisions to establish and sustain new ventures. We investigate whether
   such cognitive bias influences entrepreneurial venture performance using
   data on commercialization efforts for university inventions. In contrast
   to prior studies, our results suggest that entrepreneurial overoptimism
   does not appear to be the determining factor in the decision to found a
   firm. We do find that entrepreneurs continue unsuccessful development
   efforts for longer periods of time than do established firms, which is
   consistent with entrepreneurial overoptimism in the development of
   technologies with uncertain market prospects. This latter finding is
   also consistent with rationality-based models of decision-making
   behavior, however. We find that the economic returns associated with
   many of the technologies in our sample are realized after the start-up
   has been acquired by an established firm, suggesting that start-ups may

AB In contrast to the large and rapidly growing literature on information
   technology (IT) investments and firm productivity, we know very little
   about the role of personal computers in business creation. Using matched
   data from the 1997-2001 Computer and Internet Usage Supplements to
   subsequent Outgoing Rotation Group files from the Current Population
   Survey (CPS), I explore the relationship between computer ownership and
   entrepreneurship. Trends over the past two decades provide some evidence
   of a positive relationship between home computers and entrepreneurship
   rates, but the evidence is not clear. In contrast, an analysis of the
   relationship between computer ownership and entrepreneurship at the
   individual level provides evidence that individuals who had access to a
   home computer are substantially more likely to become entrepreneurs over
   the following 12-15 months. Probit and bivariate probit regressions also
   provide evidence of a strong positive relationship between computer
   ownership and entrepreneurship among women, but only limited evidence
   for men. Further, estimates from the CPS indicate that entrepreneurs who
   had prior access to home computers create a large variety of types of
   businesses and not only those in the IT industry.

   on the commercialization direction of technology-based start-ups by
   asking: To what extent (if at all) do VC-funded start-ups engage in
   cooperative commercialization strategies (strategic alliances or
   technology licensing, or both) relative to a comparable set of
   start-ups, and with what consequences? To address these questions, I
   assemble a novel data set that matches firms receiving a federal
   research and development subsidy through the U.S. Small Business
   Innovative Research program to VC-funded firms by observable
   characteristics in five technology-intensive industries. These data
   allow decoupling of cooperative activity resulting from start-up
   development via the passage of calendar time from that due to
   association with VCs. An analysis of the 696 start-ups in the sample
   (split by an external funding source) suggests substantial boosts in
   both cooperative activity associated with VC-backed firms and in the
   likelihood of an initial public offering.

AB Using a random sample of 221 new Swedish ventures initiated in 1998, we
   examine why some new ventures are more likely than others to
   successfully be awarded capital from external sources. We examine
   venture financing as a staged selection process in which two sequential
   selection events systematically winnow the population of ventures and
   influence which ventures receive financing. For a venture to receive
   external financing its founders must first select it as a candidate for
   external funding, and then a financier must fund it. We find evidence
   that founders select ventures as candidates for external finance based
   on their perceptions of market competition, market growth, and
   employment growth, while financiers base funding decisions on objective
   verifiable indicators of venture development, such as the completion of
   organizing activities, marketing activities, and the level of sales of
   the venture. Our findings have implications for venture financing and
   evolutionary theories of social processes.

AB Immigrant entrepreneurs often rely on their group's local social capital
   in their new home market to establish and maintain their businesses. In
   particular, immigrant entrepreneurs with few resources of their own
   receive help from those possessing more resources. Supporting these
   arguments using the empirical setting of Gujarati immigrant
   entrepreneurs in the lodging industry, we find that the likelihood of
   survival of an immigrant entrepreneur's hotel increases when surrounded
   by higher counts of branded hotels (representing high-resource
   establishments) owned by individuals from their ethnic group but is
   unaffected by unbranded motels (representing low-resource
   establishments) owned by members of their ethnic group or by branded
   hotels owned by individuals from other ethnic groups. These results
   isolate and reinforce the importance of social capital not only for
   immigrant entrepreneurs but also more generally for any entrepreneurs
   belonging to ethnic, professional, religious, or social groups.

AB This paper examines how established firms conduct continual
   entrepreneurial search for possibilities for long-term growth. Drawing
   on comprehensive internal documents of the DuPont Company over a 20-year
   period, we develop a search process that is a departure from frequent
   depictions of search as local or random. Longitudinal field data show
   that corporate entrepreneurs follow a "moving, anchored search" for
   growth possibilities. Employing this framework as lens, we develop
   propositions. We find that corporate entrepreneurs are more likely to
   conduct search in new domains following events that cause them to expect
   future performance to change significantly and lastingly. This is in
   contrast to the literature that has typically modeled the initiation of
   search as a response to poor past performance. Because new domains are
   unexplored territories for corporate entrepreneurs, they utilize
   transitional levers that they perceive will facilitate the move from
   existing domains to new ones. These perceived transitional levers,
   however, typically prove inaccurate or incomplete. Content within
   domains is searched using anchors whose locations and numbers change.
   The combination of search process and content searched influences the
   particular growth possibilities discovered and created. Search and
   pursuit of growth possibilities is accompanied by the creation of new
   knowledge and new capabilities.

   innovations. An innovation can be exploited by the established firm as
   an internal venture, pursued by a new firm start-up as an external
   venture, or not commercialized at all. The limited commercialization
   capacity of the established firm in the short run results in an option
   value of waiting. In this setup, start-up firms emerge when the
   established firm is generating many innovations or is selective because
   the option value of waiting is high, or both. The model predicts that
   innovations commercialized through internal ventures are characterized
   by a higher fit with the internal resources of the established firm, a
   higher cannibalization of the established firm's existing businesses,
   and a lower profitability than innovations commercialized through
   external ventures. The model furthermore generates predictions on the

AB To what extent do firms engage in product line actions simultaneously
   with actions in other marketing variables? What are the determinants of
   product line actions? To what extent are product line actions proactive?
   To what degree are they reactive? How can a firm's product line action
   elasticity (percent change in product line length with respect to
   percent change in competitor's past and anticipated actions) be
   decomposed into reaction and anticipation elasticities? Are product line
   actions and elasticities symmetric across market leaders and followers?
   To address these questions, we develop a conceptual framework comprising
   determinants of product line and other marketing actions in a single
   framework. We formulate hypotheses about the asymmetries between market
   leaders and followers regarding product line actions based on extended
   expectancy-valence and competitive demand elasticity theories. We
   develop a simultaneous equation model of demand and supply with product
   line and other marketing actions, which can be used to identify reaction
   and anticipation elasticities through the rational expectations
   approach. We estimate the model using data from the computer printer
   market comprising the market leader, Hewlett Packard (HP), and
   followers: Epson, Canon, and Lexmark. The results show that the market
   leader practices a product-proliferation strategy and rarely fights on
   price. In contrast, market followers adopt a price-fighting strategy. A
   firm is more likely to engage in product line actions when its
   competitors changed their product lines in the past, when the firm is
   large, and when its price is high. Product line reaction and
   anticipation elasticities are asymmetric between themselves and across
   the firms. For the market leader (followers), product line reaction
   elasticity is higher (lower) than product line anticipation elasticity.
   These differences are related to product line demand elasticities, which
   are higher for the market leader than they are for the followers.

   firms with specialized complementary assets, increases in patent
   effectiveness increase patenting propensity but reduce the propensity to

AB Decision analysis produces measures of value such as expected net
   present values or expected utilities and ranks alternatives by these
   value estimates. Other optimization-based processes operate in a similar
   manner. With uncertainty and limited resources, an analysis is never
   perfect, so these value estimates are subject to error. We show that if
   we take these value estimates at face value and select accordingly, we
   should expect the value of the chosen alternative to be less than its
   estimate, even if the value estimates are unbiased. Thus, when comparing
   actual outcomes to value estimates, we should expect to be disappointed
   on average, not because of any inherent bias in the estimates
   themselves, but because of the optimization-based selection process. We
   call this phenomenon the optimizer's curse and argue that it is not well
   understood or appreciated in the decision analysis and management
   science communities. This curse may be a factor in creating skepticism
   in decision makers who review the results of an analysis. In this paper,
   we study the optimizer's curse and show that the resulting expected
   disappointment may be substantial. We then propose the use of Bayesian
   methods to adjust value estimates. These Bayesian methods can be viewed
   as disciplined skepticism and provide a method for avoiding this
   postdecision disappointment.

AB The tendency of orders to increase in variability as one moves up a
   supply chain is commonly known as the bullwhip effect. We study this
   phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple,
   serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand.
   We conduct two experiments on two different sets of participants. In the
   first, we find the bullwhip effect still exists when normal operational
   causes (e.g., batching, price fluctuations, demand estimation, etc.) are
   removed. The persistence of the bullwhip effect is explained to some
   extent by evidence that decision makers consistently underweight the
   supply line when making order decisions. In the second experiment, we
   find that the bullwhip, and the underlying tendency of underweighting,
   remains when information on inventory levels is shared. However, we
   observe that inventory information helps somewhat to alleviate the
   bullwhip effect by helping upstream chain members better anticipate and
   prepare for fluctuations in inventory needs downstream. These
   experimental results support the theoretically suggested notion that
   upstream chain members stand to gain the most from information-sharing
   initiatives.

AB In the extensive literature on learning curves, scholars have ignored
   outcome measures of organizational performance evaluated by customers.
   We explore whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve
   pattern. Do organizations learn to reduce customer dissatisfaction?
   Customer dissatisfaction occurs when customers' ex ante expectations
   about a product or service exceed ex post perceptions about the product
   or service. Because customers can increase expectations over time,
   customer dissatisfaction may not decline even when the product or
   service improves. Consequently, it is an open question whether customer
   dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Drawing from the
   literatures on learning curves and organizational learning, we
   hypothesize that customer dissatisfaction follows a U-shaped function of
   operating experience (Hypothesis 1), that focused airlines learn faster
   to reduce customer dissatisfaction than full-service airlines
   (Hypothesis 2), and that organizational learning curves for customer
   dissatisfaction are heterogeneous across airlines (Hypothesis 3). We
   test these hypotheses with quarterly data covering 1987 to 1998 on
   consumer complaints against the 10 largest U.S. airlines. We find strong
   support for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 2 is not supported
   in the sense that the average focused airline did not learn faster than
   the average full-service airline. However, we do find that the best
   focused airline learns faster than the best full-service airline. We
   explore this result by extending a knowledge-based view of managing
   productivity learning curves in factories to complaint learning curves
   in airlines.

   behavior. Specifically, individual characteristics and product type are

   five different categories of usability. The weighted ratings of the five
   categories together determine use behavior and purchase behavior, after
   controlling for purchase need, experience with similar sites, and
   previous purchase on the specific sites. The model was tested in a

   assessments for multiple websites from four different industries-i.e.,

   agencies. Six months later, 370 of these individuals provided responses
   to help understand the transition from visitor to customer, i.e.,
   whether they actually transacted with a specific website. Results
   provided strong support for the model and yield important theoretical
   and practical implications.

   paper explores differences in investment patterns of firms that
   implement RI-based compensation plans conditional on whether the firms
   switched from earnings or return on investment (ROI)-based compensation.
   I find that the pattern of investment for firms switching to RI from
   earnings-based compensation is opposite to that of firms switching from
   ROI-based compensation. Changes in investment within each individual
   subgroup yield weaker, mixed results. In addition, this paper documents
   that delivered RI increases in firms that implement RI. My paper
   contributes to the literature on the investment effects of RI by
   examining the relevance of a set of arguments that have been made in
   management accounting textbooks since 1965. These arguments are still
   found in current textbooks and are commonly taught to students in
   graduate level managerial accounting classes. The arguments help us to
   examine a natural experiment in which we can better specify the
   conditions under which RI use is expected to be associated with changes
   in investment.

   reducing the influence of context on preferential choices. We propose
   that a decision maker who is exposed to relevant attribute levels will
   form spontaneous valuations, which will then insulate the decision maker
   from the effects of context during subsequent preference assessment.
   Results from three studies supported this hypothesis. Pre-exposure to
   product attribute levels undermined the impact of attribute priming,
   decision framing, and asymmetric dominance on preferential choices. A
   fourth study demonstrated that similar results can be obtained by

AB We propose a parameter estimation method based on what we call the
   minimum decisional regret principle. We focus on mathematical
   programming models with objective functions that depend linearly on
   costs or other parameters. The approach is illustrated for cost
   estimation in production planning using linear programming models. The
   method uses past planning data to estimate costs that are otherwise
   difficult to estimate. We define a monetary measure of distance between
   observed plans and optimal ones, called decisional regret. The proposed
   estimation algorithm finds parameter values for which the associated
   optimal plans are as near as possible to the observed ones on average.
   Such techniques may be called behavioral estimation because they are
   based on the observed planning or decision-making behavior of managers
   or firms. Two numerical illustrations are given. A supporting hyperplane
   algorithm is used to solve the estimation model. A method is proposed
   for obtaining range estimates of the parameters when multiple
   alternative estimates exist. We also propose a new validation approach
   for this estimation principle, which we call the target-mode agreement
   criterion.

AB Conjoint analysis is a statistical technique used to elicit partworth
   utilities for product attributes from consumers to aid in the evaluation
   of market potential for new products. The objective of the
   share-of-choice problem (a common approach to new product design) is to
   find the design that maximizes the number of respondents for whom the
   new product's utility exceeds a specific hurdle (reservation utility).
   We present an exact branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the
   share-of-choice problem. Our empirical results, based on several large
   commercial data sets and simulated data from a controlled experiment,
   suggest that the approach is useful for finding provably optimal
   solutions to realistically sized problems, including cases where
   partworths contain estimation error.

AB Although product development research often focuses on activities prior
   to product launch, for long-lived, adaptable products like software,
   development can continue over the entire product life cycle. For
   managers of these products the challenges are to predict when and how
   much the products will change and to understand how their development
   decisions influence the timing and magnitude of future change
   activities. We develop a two-stage model that relates environmental
   volatility to product development decisions and product development
   decisions to software volatility. The model is evaluated using a data
   archive that captures changes over 20 years to a firm's environment, its
   managers' development choices, and its software products. In Stage 1 we
   find that higher environmental volatility leads to greater use of
   process technology and standard component designs but less team member
   rotation. Earlier development decisions strongly influence current
   development choices, especially for product design and process
   technology. In Stage 2 we find that increased use of standard component
   designs dampens future software volatility by decreasing the average
   rate and magnitude of change. Adding new team members increases product
   enhancements at a faster pace than more intense use of process
   technology but adds repairs at almost the same rate as enhancements.

AB We present a model of fixing or patching a software problem after the
   product has been released in the market. Specifically, we model a
   software firm's trade-off in releasing a buggy product early and
   investments in fixing it later. just as the marginal cost of producing
   software can be effectively zero, so can the marginal cost of repairing
   multiple copies of defective software by issuing patches. We show that
   due to the fixed cost nature of investments in patching, a software
   vendor has incentives to release a buggier product early and patch it
   later in a larger market. Thus, a software monopolist releases a product
   with fewer bugs but later than what is socially optimal. We contrast
   this result with physical good markets where market size does not play
   any role in quality provision. We also show that for comparable costs, a
   software monopolist releases the product with more bugs but invests more
   in post-patching support later than the physical good monopolist.

AB In many settings, firms rely on independent contractors, or freelancers,
   for the provision of certain services. The benefits of such
   relationships for both firms and workers are often understood in terms
   of increased flexibility. Less understood is the impact of freelancing
   on individual performance. While it is often presumed that the
   performance of freelancers is largely portable across organizations, it
   is also possible that a given worker's performance may vary across
   organizations if he or she develops firm-specific skills and knowledge
   over time. We examine this issue empirically by considering the
   performance of cardiac surgeons, many of whom perform operations at
   multiple hospitals within narrow periods of time. Using patient
   mortality as an outcome measure, we find that the quality of a surgeon's
   performance at a given hospital improves significantly with increases in
   his or her recent procedure volume at that hospital but does not
   significantly improve with increases in his or her volume at other
   hospitals. Our findings suggest that surgeon performance is not fully
   portable across hospitals (i.e., some portion of performance is firm
   specific). Further, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that this
   result may be driven by the familiarity that a surgeon develops with the
   assets of a given organization.

   (1) manufacturers whose reference groups showed large variance in

   (the mean of) those changes, (2) manufacturers who have large reference

AB Making effective decisions under risk often requires making accurate
   predictions of other people's decisions under risk. We experimentally
   assess the accuracy of people's predictions of others' risky choices. In
   four studies, we find evidence of systematic inaccuracy: predictions of
   others' choices are too regressive. That is, people predict that others'
   choices will be closer to risk neutrality than those choices actually
   are. Where people are risk seeking, they predict that others will be
   risk seeking but substantially less so; likewise, where people are risk
   averse, they predict that others will be risk averse but substantially
   less so. Put differently, people predict that others' choices will
   reveal a more muted form of prospect theory's fourfold pattern of risk
   preferences than actually prevails. Two psychological concepts, the
   notion of risk-as-feelings and of an empathy gap, help account for
   regressive mispredictions. We explore several debiasing techniques
   suggested by these notions and also find that self-reported ratings of
   empathy moderate the magnitude of regressive mispredictions.

   towards risk and choice of the benchmark. The analysis therefore
   illustrates how investors can achieve their desired performance profile

   moment as a risk measure for downside loss aversion and compare
   mean-variance (M-V) and mean-lower partial moment (M-LPM) optimal
   portfolios under nonnormal asset return distributions. When asset
   returns are nearly normally distributed, there is little difference
   between the optimal M-V and M-LPM portfolios. When asset returns are
   nonnormal with large left tails, we document significant differences in

AB Internet technology has allowed for a higher degree of decoupling
   between the information-intensive sales process and the physical process
   of inventory management than its brick-and-mortar counterpart. As a
   result, some Internet retailers choose to outsource inventory and
   back-end operations to focus on the sales/marketing aspects of
   e-commerce. Nonetheless, many retailers keep fulfillment capabilities
   in-house. In this paper, we identify and empirically test factors that
   persuade firms to integrate inventory and fulfillment capabilities with
   virtual storefronts. Based on the extant literature and previous
   research in e-commerce, we formulate nine theoretical predictions. We
   then use data from a sample of over 50 public Internet retailers to test
   whether empirical data are consistent with these hypotheses. Finally,
   given the strategic importance and financial magnitude of the inventory
   investment decision, we analyze the effect of this decision on the
   economic success of Internet retailers during the period of study. We
   find that there are many circumstances in which it is prudent to own
   fulfillment capabilities and inventory. Empirical data are consistent
   with hypotheses that this tendency is higher for older firms selling
   small, high-margin products, offering lower levels of product variety;
   and facing lower demand uncertainty. We also discover that firms making
   inventory ownership decisions that are consistent with an empirical
   benchmark derived from environmental and strategic factors are less
   likely to go bankrupt than those making inconsistent inventory choices.

AB One of the goals of procurement is to establish a competitive price
   while affording the buyer some flexibility in selecting the suppliers to
   deal with. Reverse auctions do not have this flexibility, because it is
   the auction rules and not the buyer that determines the winner. In
   practice, however, hybrid mechanisms that remove some suppliers and a
   corresponding amount of demand from the auction market are quite common.
   We find that in theory such hybrid mechanisms increase competition and
   make buyers better off as long as suppliers are wilting to accept
   noncompetitive contracts. It turns out that suppliers often do because
   under a wide variety of conditions, these contracts have a positive
   expected profit. Our theory relies on two behavioral assumptions: (1)
   bidders in a multiunit uniform-price reverse auction will follow the
   dominant strategy of bidding truthfully, and (2) the suppliers who have
   been removed from the market will accept noncompetitive contracts that
   have a positive expected profit. Our experiment demonstrates that
   bidders in the auction behave very close to following the dominant
   strategy regardless of whether this auction is a stand-alone or a part
   of a hybrid mechanism. We also find that suppliers accept noncompetitive
   contracts sufficiently often (although not always) to make the hybrid
   mechanism outperform the reverse auction in the laboratory as well as in
   theory.

   can pursue one of three end-product roles: sole entrant, as with 3Com
   that, until recently, offered its Palm operating system only as part of
   its own Palm handheld devices; co-optor, as with Canon, whose specialty
   motors go into its own and HP laser printers; component supplier, as
   with Intel, which has refrained from making its own PCs. Applying extant
   theoretical and modeling perspectives, especially from branding, spatial
   competition, and channels, we show that although each of the three roles
   has its unique domain of optimality, the co-optor role is the most
   widely optimal for the MPCB; it is profit maximizing even when the end
   products are strong (but not perfect) substitutes, an alternative
   component is available and the downstream market is saturated. Optimal
   prices under the co-optor role are higher than under the other roles. We
   provide an illustrative application of the model to three real-world

   service requirements that exceed the threshold T join the second queue,

AB We study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two
   suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more
   expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier
   may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in
   which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable
   supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single
   disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory,
   mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive
   acceptance. We find that a supplier's percentage uptime and the nature
   of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key
   determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime,
   sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as
   disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a
   mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier
   and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has
   finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse.
   Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can

   We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal
   disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the
   firm's costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than
   contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare.

AB This study discusses a new procedure for masking confidential numerical
   data-a procedure called data shuffling-in which the values of the
   confidential variables are "shuffled" among observations. The shuffled
   data provides a high level of data utility and minimizes the risk of
   disclosure. From a practical perspective, data shuffling overcomes
   reservations about using perturbed or modified confidential data because
   it retains all the desirable properties of perturbation methods and
   performs better than other masking techniques in both data utility and
   disclosure risk. In addition, data shuffling can be implemented using
   only rank-order data, and thus provides a nonparametric method for
   masking. We illustrate the applicability of data shuffling for small and
   large data sets.

AB Previous studies have provided evidence of the positive impact of
   transactive memory (TM) on group performance, such as the efficient
   storage and recall of knowledge and better product quality. This paper
   aims to unify the experimental research on TM and to extend it to more
   dynamic and diverse group settings. In this paper, we develop an
   empirically grounded computational model-ORGMEM-and apply it to explore
   the contingent effects of TM on group performance. The comparison
   between virtual experimental results and relevant laboratory
   experimental results demonstrates the validity of ORGMEM as a useful
   tool to study memory-related phenomena. Through a series of virtual
   experiments, we find that TM decreases group response time by
   facilitating knowledge retrieval processes and improves decision quality
   by informing task coordination and evaluation. Our results also suggest
   that the effects of TM are contingent upon group characteristics, such
   as group size and environment, as well as the dimension along which
   group performance is assessed. Overall, TM seems to be more beneficial
   to small groups using quality as the dependent variable, but more
   beneficial to large groups, groups in a dynamic task environment, and
   groups in a volatile knowledge environment using time as the dependent
   variable.

AB Deciding who should receive a mail-order catalog is among the most
   important decisions that mail-order-catalog firms must address. In
   practice, the current approach to the problem is invariably myopic:
   firms send catalogs to customers who they think are most likely to order
   from that catalog. In doing so, the firms overlook the long-run
   implications of these decisions. For example, it may be profitable to
   mail to customers who are unlikely to order immediately if sending the
   current catalog increases the probability of a future order. We propose
   a model that allows firms to optimize mailing decisions by addressing
   the dynamic implications of their decisions. The model is conceptually
   simple and straightforward to implement. We apply the model to a large
   sample of historical data provided by a catalog firm and then evaluate
   its performance in a large-scale field test. The findings offer support
   for the proposed model but also identify opportunities for further
   improvement.

AB The personal video recorder (PVR) facilitates the use of targeted
   advertising by allowing companies to monitor television viewing behavior
   and to build demographic profiles of viewers from the data that are
   collected. Our research explores the extent to which an advertiser
   should allocate resources to increase the quality of its targeting. We
   present a game-theoretic model that extends the conventional measurement
   of targeting quality by exploring the trade-off between two measures:
   accuracy and recognition. Accuracy measures the likelihood that any
   target segment prediction is correct, while recognition conversely
   measures the likelihood that any member of the target segment is
   identified. We find that the relative resources allocated to improving
   accuracy and recognition depend upon the size of the population of
   viewers, the propensity of viewers to skip commercials, the overall cost
   of airing commercials, and the competitive environment. Furthermore, the
   incentives to improve accuracy are markedly different from those to
   improve recognition. Although improving accuracy does not affect the
   extent of price competition, improving recognition leads to intensified
   price competition and reduced profitability in the product market. Thus,
   when facing a competitor that pursues a strategy to improve its
   recognition of potential customers, an advertiser should choose to
   reduce its investment in recognition and increase its investment in
   accuracy.

AB This paper analyzes the trading records of a major discount brokerage
   house to investigate the disposition effect, the tendency to sell stocks
   that have appreciated in price (winners) sooner than stocks that trade
   below the purchase price (losers). In contrast to previous research that
   has demonstrated the disposition effect by aggregating across investors,
   our main objective is to identify differences in the disposition bias
   across individuals and explain this in terms of underlying investor
   characteristics. Building on the findings in experimental economics and
   social psychology, we hypothesize that differences in investor literacy
   about financial markets and trading frequency are responsible in part
   for the variation in individual disposition effect. Using demographic
   and socioeconomic variables as proxies for investor literacy, we find
   empirical evidence that wealthier individuals and individuals employed
   in professional occupations exhibit a lower disposition effect.
   Consistent with experimental economics, trading frequency also tends to
   reduce the disposition effect. We provide guidelines for investment
   advisors, regulators, and investment communities to utilize our findings
   and help investors make better decisions.

   quantities for a single product over a finite horizon for a
   capacity-constrained manufacturer facing price-sensitive demands. There
   is a fixed cost per production run and a variable cost per unit
   produced, both of which may vary by period. We characterize properties
   of the optimal solution, considering cases with constant and
   time-varying capacity, and with and without speculative motive for
   holding inventory. We show that, counter to intuition, optimal prices
   may increase as the capacity increases, even when capacity is constant
   over the horizon. We also show that increases in capacity do not always
   exhibit diminishing marginal returns.
   Our procedure produces solutions with much higher profits than can be
   obtained from a sophisticated sequential procedure in which a
   well-informed and optimum-seeking marketing department makes pricing
   decisions and the manufacturing department seeks to satisfy the
   resulting demands at minimum cost. Our results also suggest that firms
   with seasonal demand and tight capacity constraints should be more
   aggressive in setting prices to manage their demands than what is
   typically done in practice. Finally; we discuss how a decision maker can
   use our procedure as an aid in solving multiproduct versions of the

   research to determine the industry structures and patterns of expected

   activities does, in fact, generate and sustain capability heterogeneity
   among firms. We combine a widely used agent-based model where firms
   search to discover sets of activities that complement one another
   (reducing overall costs or raising product quality) with traditional
   economic models of competition among profit-maximizing firms. The
   agent-based model produces a distribution of performance (interpreted as
   variable cost or product quality) among firms and the competition models
   determine resulting industry outcomes including patterns of entry, exit,
   and profits. The integration of economic models of competition among
   firms with an agent-based model of search for improvement by firms
   reveals a rich relationship between interdependencies in production
   functions and industry structure, firm profits, and industry average
   profitability.

AB Many young firms use strategic actions to attract partners who help them

   use of strategic actions to attract partners and increase system size in
   the context of franchising. We build on research in entrepreneurship,
   marketing, organization theory, strategic management, and finance to
   develop specific hypotheses about the influences of franchisor pricing
   policy and strategic control decisions on system size. We test these
   hypotheses empirically, using panel data on a sample of 1,292 business
   format franchise systems from 152 industries that were established in
   the United States between 1979 and 1996 and followed from their
   inception forward in time. Our model accounts for the endogeneity of
   strategic decisions, controls for unobserved firm and industry factors,
   and accounts for selection effects due to system failure. The results
   show that franchisors that grow larger (1) lower royalty rates as the
   systems age, (2) have low up-front franchise fees that rise over time,
   (3) own a small proportion of outlets and lower that percentage over
   time, (4) keep franchisees' initial investment low, and (5) finance
   their franchisees.

AB In some mechanism design problems, finite-type spaces may be natural
   ones to consider, yet the current literature is dominated by analyses of
   continuous-type spaces. This probably derives from the intellectual
   dominance of the early work in this area. Here we present an analysis of
   the finite-state case that unifies and generalizes current understanding
   of these problems. We analyze general quasi-linear utility functions
   among asymmetric agents with an arbitrary number of finite types, in the
   context of incentive-compatible direct revelation games. A key part of
   the analysis is the relationship between expected benefit functions that
   feature alternative forms of supermodularity that translate into
   relaxations or restrictions of the original problem. The required
   features can be attained with a range of assumptions on the model
   primitives, each of which can support the results. This unified approach
   can suggest a range of alternative assumption combinations, often more
   general than their counterparts in the continuous-space literature, and
   each of which can reduce the problem to a more tractable form. Also,
   mechanism design problems with finite-type spaces can require conscious
   attention to how the principal handles ties, which are probability-zero
   events, and hence innocuous in continuous spaces.

AB Faced with fragmented markets, saturated and demanding customers, and
   global competition, firms increasingly must design and offer a line of
   innovative, quality-differentiated products to target customers with
   differing willingness to pay (WTP). In this context, designing a special
   class of products that we term development-intensive products (DIPs)-for
   which the fixed costs of development far outweigh the unit-variable
   costs-presents some unique managerial challenges. Examples of such
   development-intensive offerings abound in a number of industries,
   including the pharmaceutical, information, and entertainment sectors of
   the economy. Our contributions in this paper are threefold: (a) to show
   that managerial insights from the traditional approach to product-line
   design developed for unit-variable cost-intensive products do not carry
   over to DIPs, (b) to present new mechanisms and managerial guidelines
   for designing a family of products for which development costs cannot be
   ignored, and (c) to illustrate the insights with an extended industry
   example. We find that the design approach based on degrading (or
   subtracting value from) a high-end product to obtain a subsumed low-end
   edition, shown in the literature to be an effective approach for
   designing unit cost-intensive products, can be inappropriate for DIPs.
   This limitation of value subtraction has implications for the number of
   variants and the sequence in which they are developed. As an alternative
   to a subsumed product-design strategy, we propose and examine the
   overlapped product-design approach, in which a low-end product is not
   completely subsumed within its high-end counterpart, but differentiated
   on additional vertical quality dimensions. Our results both explain the
   recent challenges of firms with subsumed low-end products and guide them
   in designing a product line to successfully address emerging low-end
   market segments.

   important dimensions of performance support the proposition that

   development. Integrated firms realize performance advantages when

AB Internet companies extensively use the practice of drop-shipping, where
   the wholesaler stocks and owns the inventory and ships products directly
   to customers at retailers' request. Under the drop-shipping arrangement,
   the supply chain benefits from risk pooling because the inventory for
   multiple retailers is stocked at the same location, the wholesaler's.
   Another more traditional channel alternative on the Internet is one in
   which retailers stock and own the inventory These two supply chain
   structures, which predominate on the Internet, result in different
   inventory risk allocation, stocking decisions, and profits for channel
   members. Moreover, the two channel alternatives can be combined into a
   dual strategy whereby the retailer uses local inventory as a primary
   source and relies on drop-shipping as a backup. We model the dual
   strategy as a noncooperative game among the retailers and the
   wholesaler, analyze it, and obtain insights into the structural
   properties of the equilibrium solution to facilitate development of
   recommendations for practicing managers. Finally, we characterize
   situations in which each of three channels is preferable by specifying
   appropriate ranges of critical parameters, including demand variability,
   the number of retailers in the channel, wholesale prices, and
   transportation costs.

AB We consider the case of a first-time interaction between a buyer and a
   supplier who is unreliable in delivery The supplier declares her
   estimate of the ability to meet the order obligations, but the buyer may
   have a different estimate, which may be higher or lower than the
   supplier's estimate. We derive the Nash bargaining solution and discuss
   the role of using a down-payment or nondelivery penalty in the contract.
   For the case of buyer overtrust, the down-payment contract maximizes
   channel profits when the supplier's estimate is public information. If
   the supplier's estimate is private information, a nonsymmetric contract
   is shown to be efficient and incentive compatible. For the case of buyer
   undertrust, the contract structure is quite different as both players
   choose not to include down-payments in the contract. When delivery
   estimates are public information, a nondelivery penalty contract is able
   to maximize channel profits if the buyer uses the supplier's estimate in
   making the ordering decision. If estimates are private information,
   channel profits are maximized only if the true estimates of both players
   are not far part. We also discuss the effect of different risk profiles
   on the nature of the bargaining solution. In three extensions of the
   model, we consider the following variants of the basic problem. First,
   we analyze the effect of early versus late negotiation on the bargaining
   solution. Then, we study the case of endogenous supply reliability, and
   finally, for the case of repeated interactions, we discuss the impact of
   updating delivery estimates on the order quantity and negotiated prices
   of future orders.

AB This paper studies a queuing model in which a buyer sources a good or
   service from a single supplier chosen from a pool of suppliers. The
   buyer seeks to minimize the sum of her procurement and operating costs,
   the latter of which depends on the supplier's lead time. The selected
   supplier can regulate his lead time, but faster lead times are costly.
   Although the buyer selects the supplier to source from (possibly via an
   auction) and dictates the contractual terms, the buyer's bargaining
   power is limited by asymmetric information: The buyer only has an
   estimate of the suppliers' costs, while the suppliers know their costs
   precisely. We identify a procurement mechanism that minimizes the
   buyer's total cost (procurement plus operating). This mechanism is not
   simple: It is a numerically derived nonlinear menu of contracts.
   Therefore, we study several simpler mechanisms: e.g., one that charges a
   late fee and one that specifies a fixed lead-time requirement (no menus,
   no nonlinear functions). We find that simple mechanisms are nearly
   optimal (generally within 1% of optimal) because asymmetric information
   conveys significant protection to the supplier, i.e., the supplier is
   able to retain most of the benefit of having a lower cost. Renegotiation
   is another concern with the optimal mechanism: Because it does not
   minimize the supply chain's cost, the firms can be both better off if
   they throw away the contract and start over. Interestingly, we find that
   the potential gain from renegotiation is relatively small with either
   the optimal or our simple mechanisms. We conclude that our simple
   mechanisms are quite attractive along all relevant dimensions: buyer's
   performance, supply chain performance, simplicity, and robustness to
   renegotiation.

   speculative market effectively account for information contained in
   prices and price movements. The horse race betting market is an ideal
   environment to explore these issues. A conditional logit model is
   constructed to determine winning probabilities based on bookmakers'
   closing prices and the time-indexed movement of prices to the market
   close. We incorporate a technique for extracting predictors from price
   (odds) curves using orthogonal polynomials. The results indicate that
   closing prices do not fully incorporate market price information,
   particularly information that is less readily discernable by market

AB The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm suggests that strategic
   deployment of capabilities allows strategic business units (SBUs) to
   exploit distinctive competencies and create sustainable competitive
   advantage. Following the RBV, we propose a new predictive methodology
   for deriving typologies of SBUs that accommodates heterogeneity among
   SBUs with respect to their strategic capabilities, how effectively they
   are employed, and performance. Statistically, we devise a constrained
   finite-mixture structural-equation procedure that simultaneously
   accounts for firm capabilities, performance outcomes, and the
   relationships between them. The procedure allows for a comprehensive
   modeling and grouping of entities, and simultaneously provides a
   diagnosis of the sources of heterogeneity via the flexibility of
   estimating a series of nested models. Managerially, our proposed
   methodology is grounded in the strategic type and RBV literature and can
   capture the effects of environmental and industry-specific factors.
   Using data obtained from 216 SBUs in the United States for illustration,
   the results show that our derived four mixed-type solution dominates the
   four-group, Prospectors-Analyzers-Defenders-Reactors classification as
   well as a number of other nested model solutions in terms of objective
   statistical fit criteria for this data set, suggesting a more
   contingency-driven strategic stance adopted by these SBUs. We conclude
   with a discussion of the theoretical and managerial benefits of an
   improved methodology for empirically deriving strategic typologies.

AB Quasi-Monte Carlo methods overcome the problem of sample clustering in
   regular Monte Carlo simulation and have been shown to improve simulation
   efficiency in the derivatives pricing literature when the price is
   expressed as a multidimensional integration and the integrand is
   suitably smooth. For portfolio value-at-risk (VaR) problems, the
   distribution of portfolio value change is based on the expectation of an
   indicator function, hence the integrand is discontinuous. The purpose of
   this paper is to smooth the expectation estimation of an indicator
   function via Fourier transform so that the faster convergence rate of
   quasi-Monte Carlo methods can be reclaimed theoretically. Under fairly
   mild assumptions, the simulation of portfolio value-at-risk is fast and
   accurate. Numerical examples elucidate the advantage of the proposed
   approach over regular Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

AB Term structure models have often been criticized for failing to explain
   satisfactorily the yield spread between corporate and Treasury bonds. A
   potential problem is that the personal tax effect is ignored in these
   models. In this paper, we employ a structural model to investigate the
   role of personal taxes on both debt and equity returns in capital
   structure decisions and assess their impact on corporate bond yield
   spreads. It is shown that personal taxes affect the firm's optimal
   capital structure, and the tax premium explains a substantial portion of
   yield spreads, especially for high-grade bonds. The predictive ability
   of the model for yield spreads is much improved when personal tax
   effects are accounted for. In controlling for the liquidity effect, we
   obtain implied personal income tax rates closely in line with Graham's
   (1999) estimates.

AB We generalize Markowitz analysis to the situations involving an
   uncertain exit time. Our approach preserves the form of the original
   problem in that an investor minimizes portfolio variance for a given
   level of the expected return. However, inputs are now given by the
   generalized expressions for mean and variance-covariance matrix
   involving moments of the random exit time in addition to the conditional
   moments of asset returns. Although efficient frontiers in the
   generalized and the standard Markowitz case may coincide under certain
   conditions, we demonstrate that, by means of an example, in general that
   is not true. In particular, portfolios efficient in the standard
   Markowitz sense can be inefficient in the generalized sense and vice
   versa. As a result, an investor facing an uncertain time horizon and
   investing as if her time of exit is certain would in genera I make
   suboptimal portfolio allocation decisions. Numerical simulations show
   that a significant efficiency loss can be induced by an improper use of
   standard mean-variance analysis when time horizon is uncertain.

AB This paper analyzes competing firms' advertising strategies in markets
   characterized by dynamic market sizes. For new product innovations, a
   large literature has been developed on the basis of the celebrated Bass
   diffusion process, which captures what we call market-size dynamics.
   However, in spite of the significant literature incorporating
   competitiveness into the Bass model, few if any analytical results have
   been obtained, especially those with normative implications. On the
   other hand, important theoretical and empirical insights have recently
   been obtained using the famous Lanchester warfare model of competition,
   in which market-share dynamics are governed by advertising activities
   for mature products whose market sizes are typically fixed or stable.
   Our paper seeks to address the issue of optimal advertising strategies
   incorporating both market-share dynamics and market-size dynamics. In
   doing so, we seek to take advantage of the theoretical and normative
   insights currently available in the Lanchester formulation for mature
   products to obtain normative, analytical results on competitive
   advertising strategies for new product innovations whose markets evolve
   around the Bass process. We first obtain analytical solutions to the
   problem at hand and offer theoretical implications for competitive
   advertising on the Bass diffusion model. The model's parameters are then
   estimated using a set of data on sales and advertising expenditures of
   Polaroid Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co. in instant photography during the
   1976-1985 period; optimal trajectories for the firms' advertising
   spending are then calculated, and other marketing and managerial
   implications of optimal advertising strategies are explored.

AB Understanding what motivates participation is a central theme in the
   research on open source software (OSS) development. Our study
   contributes by revealing how the different motivations of OSS developers
   are interrelated, how these motivations influence participation leading
   to performance, and how past performance influences subsequent
   motivations. Drawing on theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation,
   we develop a theoretical model relating the motivations, participation,
   and. performance of OSS developers. We evaluate our model using survey
   and archival data collected from a longitudinal field study of software
   developers in the Apache projects. Our results reveal several important
   findings. First, we find that developers' motivations are not
   independent but rather are related in complex ways. Being paid to
   contribute to Apache projects is positively related to developers'
   status motivations but negatively related to their use-value
   motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence of diminished
   intrinsic motivation in the presence of extrinsic motivations; rather,
   status motivations enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that
   different motivations have an impact on participation in different ways.
   Developers' paid participation and status motivations lead to
   above-average contribution levels, but use-value motivations lead to
   below-average contribution levels, and intrinsic motivations do not
   significantly impact average contribution levels. Third, we find that
   developers' contribution levels positively impact their performance
   rankings. Finally, our results suggest that past-performance rankings
   enhance developers' subsequent status motivations.

AB Open source software projects rely on the voluntary efforts of thousands
   of software developers, yet we know little about why developers choose
   to participate in this collective development process. This paper
   inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the
   perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two
   software communities with different governance structures.
   In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives
   initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community
   once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For
   this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation
   becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability
   of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone
   and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code.
   Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for
   firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine
   the advantages of open source software development with proprietary
   ownership and control are discussed.

AB This paper reports data from a study that seeks to characterize the
   differences in design structure between complex software products. We
   use design structure matrices (DSMs) to map dependencies between the
   elements of a design and define metrics that allow us to compare the
   structures of different designs. We use these metrics to compare the
   architectures of two software products-the Linux operating system and
   the Mozilla Web browser-that were developed via contrasting modes of
   organization: specifically, open source versus proprietary development.
   We then track the evolution of Mozilla, paying attention to a purposeful
   "redesign" effort undertaken with the intention of making the product
   more "modular." We find significant differences in structure between
   Linux and the first version of Mozilla, suggesting that Linux had a more
   modular architecture. Yet we also find that the redesign of Mozilla
   resulted in an architecture that was significantly more modular than
   that of its predecessor and, indeed, than that of Linux. Our results,
   while exploratory, are consistent with a view that different modes of
   organization are associated with designs that possess different
   structures. However, they also suggest that purposeful managerial
   actions can have a significant impact in adapting a design's structure.
   This latter result is important given recent moves to release
   proprietary software into the public domain. These moves are likely to
   fail unless the product possesses an "architecture for participation."

AB In stark contrast with the fully participative "bazaar" imagery of open
   source software (OSS) development, some recent empirical research has
   pointed out that much of the OSS development is carried out by a small
   percentage of developers. This raises serious concerns that
   concentration of development effort on a few will limit knowledge
   sharing and underutilize the available resources. Using the notion of
   strategic interaction, this paper argues that individual developers
   often interact strategically with other highly resourceful developers by
   forming a smaller but better organized structure to intensify the types
   of epistemic interactions that matter most to the OSS development. A
   general framework of strategic interaction including participation
   inequality, conversational interactivity, and cross-thread connectivity
   is proposed to examine its impact on knowledge sharing, and validated
   using 128 discussion threads from the K Desktop Environment (KDE)
   developer mailing list. The findings indicate that strategic interaction
   has expanded knowledge sharing but with the caveat that extreme
   concentration of development could have an opposite effect. For
   researchers, this study dovetails the incentive logic by proposing and
   validating the strategic aspects of OSS participation to better
   understand the collective dynamics underpinning OSS development.
   Practitioners can use this approach to evaluate and better support
   existing knowledge-sharing initiatives.

AB The community-based model for software development in open source
   environments is becoming a viable alternative to traditional firm-based
   models. To better understand the workings of open source environments,
   we examine the effects of network embeddedness-or the nature of the
   relationship among projects and developers-on the success of open source
   projects. We find that considerable heterogeneity exists in the network
   embeddedness of open source projects and project managers. We use a
   visual representation of the affiliation network of projects and
   developers as well as a formal statistical analysis to demonstrate this
   heterogeneity and to investigate how these structures differ across
   projects and project managers. Our main results surround the effect of
   this differential network embeddedness on project success. We find that
   network embeddedness has strong and significant effects on both
   technical and commercial success, but that those effects are quite
   complex. We use latent class regression analysis to show that multiple
   regimes exist and that some of the effects of network embeddedness are
   positive under some regimes and negative under others. We use project
   age and number of page views to provide insights into the direction of
   the effect of network embeddedness on project success. Our findings show
   that different aspects of network embeddedness have powerful but subtle
   effects on project success and suggest that this is a rich environment
   for further study.

AB Technology platforms, such as Microsoft Windows, are the hubs of
   technology industries. We develop a framework to characterize the
   optimal two-sided pricing strategy of a platform firm; that is, the
   pricing strategy toward the direct users of the platform as well as
   toward firms offering applications that are complementary to the
   platform. We compare industry structures based on a proprietary platform
   (such as Windows) with those based on an open source platform (such as
   Linux), and analyze the structure of competition and industry
   implications in terms of pricing, sales, profitability, and social
   welfare. We find that, when the platform is proprietary, the equilibrium
   prices for the platform, the applications, and the platform access fee
   for applications may be below marginal cost, and we characterize demand
   conditions that lead to this. The proprietary applications sector of an
   industry based on an open source platform may be more profitable than
   the total profits of a proprietary platform industry. When users have a
   strong preference for application variety, the total profits of the
   proprietary industry are larger than the total profits of an industry
   based on an open source platform. The variety of applications is larger
   when the platform is open source. When a system based on an open source
   platform with an independent proprietary application competes with a
   proprietary system, the proprietary system is likely to dominate the
   open source platform industry both in terms of market share and
   profitability. This may explain the dominance of Microsoft in the market
   for PC operating systems.

AB This paper argues that the architecture of a codebase is a critical
   factor that lies at the heart of the open source development process. We
   define two observable properties of an architecture: (1) modularity and
   (2) option value. Developers can often make informed judgments about
   modularity and option value from early, partially implemented code
   releases. We show that codebases that are more modular or have more
   option value (1) increase developers' incentives to join and remain
   involved in an open source development effort and (2) decrease the
   amount of free riding in equilibrium. These effects occur because
   modularity and option value create opportunities for the exchange of
   valuable work among developers, opportunities that do not exist in
   codebases that are not modular or have no option value.

AB We compare how people react to good ideas authored by internal rivals
   (employees at the same organization) versus external rivals (employees
   at a competitor organization). We hypothesize that internal and external
   rivals evoke contrasting kinds of threats. Specifically, using knowledge
   from an internal rival is difficult because it threatens the self and
   its competence: It is tantamount to being a "follower" and losing status
   relative to a direct competitor. By contrast, external rivals pose a
   lower threat to personal status, so people are more willing to use their
   knowledge. We conducted three studies. Study I showed that internal and
   external rivalry involved opposite relationships between threat and
   knowledge valuation: The more threat internal rivals provoked, the more
   people avoided their knowledge, whereas the more threat external rivals
   provoked, the more people pursued their knowledge. Study 2 explored the
   types of threat that insiders and outsiders evoked. In particular,
   people assumed that they would lose more personal status if they used an
   internal rival's knowledge and, therefore, reduced their valuation of
   that knowledge. Finally, Study 3 found that self-affirmation attenuated
   these patterns. We suggest that the threats and opportunities for
   affirmation facing the self dictate how people respond to rivals and,
   ultimately, their willingness to value new ideas.

AB Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are increasingly conducting research
   and development (R&D) in countries such as China and India, where
   intellectual property rights (IPR) protection is still far from
   adequate. This paper examines this seemingly puzzling situation. I argue
   that weak IPR leads to low returns to innovation and underutilization of
   innovative talents; MNEs that possess alternative mechanisms for
   protecting their intellectual properties will therefore find it
   attractive to conduct R&D at those locations. A theoretical framework is
   developed to capture the interaction between firm strategy and the
   institutional environment. The empirical analysis on a sample of 1,567
   U.S.-headquartered innovating firms finds results consistent with the
   hypotheses that (i) technologies developed in countries with weak IPR
   protection are used more internally, and (ii) technologies developed by
   firms with R&D in weak IPR countries show stronger internal linkages.
   The results suggest that firms may use internal organizations to
   substitute for inadequate external institutions. By doing so, they are
   able to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities presented by the
   institutional gap across countries.

AB Manufacturers and their distributors must cope with an increased flow of
   returned products from their customers. The value of commercial product
   returns, which we define as products returned for any reason within 90
   days of sale, now exceeds $100 billion annually in-the United States.
   Although the reverse supply chain of returned products represents a
   sizeable flow of potentially recoverable assets, only a relatively small
   fraction of the value is currently extracted by manufacturers; a large
   proportion of the product value erodes away because of long processing
   delays. Thus, there are significant opportunities to build competitive
   advantage from making the appropriate reverse supply chain design
   choices. In this paper, we present a network flow with delay models that
   includes the marginal value of time to identify the drivers of reverse
   supply chain design. We illustrate our approach with specific examples
   from two companies in different industries and then examine how industry
   clockspeed generally affects the choice between an efficient and a

AB This paper focuses on the timeshare industry, where members own
   timeshare "weeks" and can exchange these weeks among themselves without
   a medium of exchange (such as money). Timeshare exchanges allow for the
   weeks to be redistributed among members to better match their
   preferences and thus increase efficiency. As such, the problem falls
   within the domain of matching problems, which have recently gained much
   attention in academia. We demonstrate theoretically that the two major
   timeshare exchange mechanisms used currently (deposit-first mechanism
   and request-first mechanism) can cause efficiency loss. We propose an
   alternate exchange mechanism, the top trading cycles chains and
   spacebank (TTCCS) mechanism, and show that it can increase the
   efficiency of the timeshare exchange market because TTCCS is Pareto
   efficient, individually rational, and strategyproof. We test the three
   exchange mechanisms in laboratory experiments where we simulate exchange
   markets with networked "timeshare members." The results of the
   experiments are robust across four different environments that we
   construct and strongly support our theory The research focuses on an
   industry not studied earlier within academia and extends theoretical
   work on mechanism design to cases where supply of resources is dynamic,
   but resources can be stored.

AB We study the important problem of how to assure credible forecast
   information sharing between a supplier and a manufacturer. The supplier
   is responsible for acquiring the necessary capacity before receiving an
   order from the manufacturer who possesses private forecast information
   for her end product. We address how different contracts affect the
   supplier's capacity decision and, hence, the profitability of the
   supplier and the manufacturer. We fully develop two contracts (and
   provide explicit formulae) to enable credible forecast information
   sharing. The first is a nonlinear capacity reservation contract under
   which the manufacturer agrees to pay a fee to reserve capacity. The
   second is an advance purchase contract under which the manufacturer is
   induced to place a firm order before the supplier secures the component
   capacity used to build the end product. These contracts serve a
   strategic role in information sharing. The capacity reservation contract
   enables the supplier to detect the manufacturer's private forecast
   information, while the advance purchase contract enables the
   manufacturer to signal her forecast information. We show that channel
   coordination is possible even under asymmetric forecast information by
   combining the advance purchase contract with an appropriate payback
   agreement. Through our structural and numerical results we also show
   that the degree of forecast information asymmetry and the risk-adjusted
   profit margin are two important drivers that determine supply chain
   efficiency and which contract to adopt.

AB In many different managerial contexts, consumers "leave money on the
   table" by, for example, their failure to claim rebates, use available
   coupons, and so on. This project focuses on a related problem faced by
   homeowners who may be reluctant to file insurance claims despite the
   fact their losses are covered. We model this consumer decision by
   introducing the concept of the "pseudodeductible," a latent threshold
   above the policy deductible that governs the homeowner's claim behavior.
   In addition, we show how the observed number of claims can be modeled as
   the output of three stochastic processes that are separately, and in
   conjunction, managerially relevant: the rate at which losses occur, the
   size of each loss, and the choice of the individual to file or not file
   a claim. By allowing for the possibility of pseudodeductibles, one can
   sort out (and make accurate inferences about) these three processes.
   We test this model using a proprietary data set provided by State Farm,
   the largest underwriter of personal lines insurance in the United
   States. Using mixtures of Dirichlet processes to capture heterogeneity
   and the interplay among the three processes, we uncover several relevant
   "stories" that underlie the frequency and severity of claims. For
   instance, some customers have a small number of losses, but all are
   filed as claims, whereas others may experience many more losses, but are
   more selective about which claims they file. These stories explain
   several observed phenomena regarding the claims decisions that insurance
   customers make, and have broad implications for customer lifetime value
   and market segmentation.

   and explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show
   that (1) volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long as
   expected returns are nonzero, so that one should expect sign dependence,
   given the overwhelming evidence of volatility dependence; (2) it is
   statistically possible to have sign dependence without conditional mean
   dependence; (3) sign dependence is not likely to be found via analysis
   of sign autocorrelations, runs tests, or traditional market timing tests
   because of the special nonlinear nature of sign dependence, so that
   traditional market timing tests are best viewed as tests for sign
   dependence arising from variation in expected returns rather than from
   variation in volatility or higher moments; (4) sign dependence is not
   likely to be found in very high-frequency (e.g., daily) or very
   low-frequency (e.g., annual) returns; instead, it is more likely to be
   found at intermediate return horizons; and (5) the link between
   volatility dependence and sign dependence remains intact in
   conditionally non-Gaussian environments, for example, with time-varying
   conditional skewness and/or kurtosis.

AB Within the First World, observed differences across air carriers in
   passenger death risk are almost never statistically significant. But
   given the rarity of fatal crashes, even a lopsided split of crashes
   across airlines is unlikely to achieve significance. For greater
   perspective about relative airline safety performance, we supplemented
   an analysis of overall mortality data with a two-part statistical
   procedure. The first part-which was inspired by the way the Oakland
   Athletics Major League baseball team evaluates individual baseball
   players-allows for a sharp test of a key aspect of an equal-safety
   hypothesis, related to the frequency with which individual airlines
   suffer life-threatening events. The second test considers a further
   aspect of safety, namely the ability to recover from emergencies given
   that they have occurred. When applied to U.S. domestic jet services over
   1983-2002, the test procedures indicate that long-established airlines
   have been about equally (and hugely) successful in protecting their
   passengers from accidental death and that established airlines are not
   demonstrably safer than the "new-entrant" jet carriers formed after U.S.
   airline deregulation.

   uncertainty and ability uncertainty. We further propose that
   entrepreneurs will be risk averse with respect to demand uncertainty,
   yet "apparent risk seeking" (or overconfident) with respect to ability
   uncertainty. To examine this view, we construct a reduced-form model of
   the entrepreneur's entry decision, which we aggregate to the market
   level, then test empirically. We find that entrepreneurs in aggregate
   behave as we predict. Accordingly, risk-averse entrepreneurs are willing
   to bear market risk when the degree of ability uncertainty is comparable
   to the degree of demand uncertainty. Potential market failures exist in
   instances where there is a high demand uncertainty but low performance
   dispersion (insufficient entry), or low demand uncertainty but high

AB It is suggested that the recognition of new business opportunities often
   involves pattern recognition-the cognitive process through which
   individuals identify meaningful patterns in complex arrays of events or
   trends. Basic research on pattern recognition indicates that cognitive
   frameworks acquired through experience (e.g., prototypes) play a central
   role in this process. Such frameworks provide individuals with a basis
   for noticing connections between seemingly independent events or trends
   (e.g., advances in technology, shifts in markets, changes in government
   policies, etc.), and for detecting meaningful patterns in these
   connections. We propose that ideas for new products or services often
   emerge from the perception of such patterns. New business opportunities
   are identified when entrepreneurs, using relevant cognitive frameworks,
   "connect the dots" between seemingly unrelated events or trends and then
   detect patterns in these connections suggestive of new products or
   services. To obtain evidence on these proposals, we compared the
   "business opportunity" prototypes of novice (first-time) and repeat
   (experienced) entrepreneurs-their cognitive representations of the
   essential nature of opportunities. As predicted, the prototypes of
   experienced entrepreneurs were more clearly defined, richer in content,
   and more concerned with factors and conditions related to actually
   starting and running a new venture (e.g., generation of positive cash
   flow) than the prototypes of novice, entrepreneurs. These findings offer
   support for the view that pattern recognition is a key component of
   opportunity recognition.

AB This paper shows that rotation programs can be an effective response to
   concerns of employee budget padding. Rotation programs naturally create
   a "portfolio" of assignments for each manager, and the resulting
   diversification can reduce the downside of resource rationing. In
   particular, the production versus rents trade-off linked with adverse
   selection problems can be more efficiently carried out when the firm
   faces two managers with average information advantages, rather than one
   with a large advantage and one with a small advantage. Roughly stated,
   rotation of project assignments is a way of smoothing information across
   managers. On the other hand, if a firm places a premium on treating
   different types of projects in distinct ways, specialized assignments
   can be preferred due to the ability to confine project types to
   individual managers.

AB The year 2000 (Y2K) countdown provided a uniquely visible instance of
   spending on information technology (IT) by U.S. companies. With public
   attention riveted on potential Y2K malfunctions, managers were forced to
   evaluate their IT and make decisions about whether to modify or replace
   existing systems. In the aftermath of Y2K, critics charged that the
   problem was overblown and that companies overspent on IT. In contrast,
   we posit in this paper that efforts companies made to renew and upgrade
   their IT may have positioned them to take advantage of new e-business
   applications. As Y2K approached, managers could invest opportunistically
   in IT, which would enable them to connect with customers and suppliers
   in new ways. Contrary to the alleged overspending, we find that firm
   value increased, on average, with Y2K spending by Fortune 1000
   companies. In particular, higher firm value and subsequent earnings were
   associated with Y2K spending for firms in industries where IT was
   considered to have a transforming influence-altering traditional ways of
   doing business by redefining business processes and relationships. We
   also test whether the positive association between firm value and Y2K
   spending diminished with Y2K spending by industry peer firms, but we do
   not find support for this relative investment hypothesis.

AB This paper investigates a market-valuation-based hypothesis for employee
   stock options (ESOs). Given that stock prices do not track fundamental
   values perfectly, I show that ESOs can be used to sell overvalued stocks
   and to increase long-term shareholder value: The key cross-sectional
   prediction of the valuation rationale is that the conditional
   probability of granting options to employees and the amount of options
   granted to them are positively correlated with market valuation and
   volatility. Moreover, for extremely overvalued firms, the correlation
   between option grant and market valuation is weaker. Firms that use ESOs
   can save their regular employee compensation costs. I find strong
   empirical evidence supporting these predictions.

AB The problem of group ranking, also known as rank aggregation, has been
   studied in contexts varying from sports, to multicriteria decision
   making, to machine learning, to ranking Web pages, and to behavioral
   issues. The dynamics of the group aggregation of individual decisions
   has been a subject of central importance in decision theory. We present
   here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major
   shortcomings that exist in current models of group ranking. Moreover,
   the framework provides a specific performance measure for the quality of
   the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the individual
   decision-makers' rankings.
   The new model for the group-ranking problem presented here is based on
   rankings provided with intensity-that is, the degree of preference is
   quantified. The model allows for flexibility in decision protocols and
   can take into consideration imprecise beliefs, less than full confidence
   in some of the rankings, and differentiating between the expertise of
   the reviewers. Our approach relaxes frequently made assumptions of:
   certain beliefs in pairwise rankings; homogeneity implying equal
   expertise of all decision makers with respect to all evaluations; and
   full list requirement according to which each decision maker evaluates
   and ranks all objects. The option of preserving the ranks in certain
   subsets is also addressed in the model here. Significantly, our model is
   a natural extension and generalization of existing models, yet it is
   solvable in polynomial time. The group-rankings models are linked to
   network flow techniques.

   include preferences represented by S-shaped value functions, inverse

   stochastic dominance conditions supply a framework to test different
   features of cumulative prospect theory. In the experimental part of the
   paper, we offer a test of several joint hypotheses on the value function
   and the probability weighting function. Assuming empirically relevant
   weighting functions, we can reject the inverse S-shaped value function
   recently advocated by Levy and Levy (2002) in favor of the S-shaped
   form. In addition, we find generally supporting evidence for loss
   aversion. Violations of loss aversion can be explained by subjects using
   the overall probability of winning as a heuristic.

AB According to most models of intertemporal choice, an agent's discount
   rate is a function of how far the outcomes are removed from the present,
   and nothing else. This view has been challenged by recent studies, which
   show that discount rates tend to be higher the closer the outcomes are
   to one another (subadditive discounting) and that this can give rise to
   intransitive intertemporal choice. We develop and test a generalized
   model of intertemporal choice, the Discounting By Intervals (DBI) model,
   according to which the discount rate is a function of both how far
   outcomes are removed from the present and how far the outcomes are
   removed from one another. The model addresses past challenges to other
   models, most of which it includes as special cases, as well as the new
   challenges presented in this paper: Our studies show that when the
   interval between outcomes is very short, discount rate tends to increase
   with interval length (superadditive discounting). In the discussion we
   place our model and evidence in a broader theoretical context.

AB There has been a recent revival of interest in the geographic component
   of firm strategy. Recent research suggests that two opposing

   firms collocate in a given geographic market. Unexplored is (1) whether
   these forces have different impacts on R&D, production, and sales
   subsidiaries, leading to diverse collocation levels, and (2) how firm
   capabilities impact collocation by increasing or decreasing competition
   costs and agglomeration benefits. I explore these questions using the
   worldwide location decisions of firms in the cellular handset industry.
   I find that production and sales subsidiaries are more geographically
   dispersed, and R&D subsidiaries are more concentrated, than a random
   distribution would predict. When distinguishing firms by their
   capabilities, I find that more-capable firms collocate less than
   less-capable firms, regardless of the activity performed.

AB We examine the buyer's problem of inducing the supplier's quality effort
   using two arrangements: the appraisal regime and the certification
   regime. In the appraisal regime, the buyer inspects the units supplied
   and either charges a penalty for defective units identified during
   inspection or pays the unit price for good units. In the certification
   regime, the supplier obtains vendor certification and the buyer pays the
   unit price for all units supplied. The inspection technology and the
   certification process provide noisy information on the supplier's
   quality effort. In the appraisal regime, the buyer implements the
   supplier's high-quality and low-inspection. The supplier's expected
   profit is greater than his reservation profit because of an additional
   agency cost: The buyer has to prevent the supplier from performing
   unwanted/preemptive inspection (which gives rise to indirect costs from
   delay, etc.). This additional agency cost arises precisely when the
   effectiveness of inspection is high. This provides a moral-hazard-based
   rationale for the increasing use of certification (such as ISO 9000) in
   spite of (in fact, because of) the increasing effectiveness of
   inspection. The potential for additional agency cost incurred by the
   buyer in the appraisal regime highlights an indirect cost associated
   with inspection.

AB We characterize supply chain settings in-which perfect coordination can
   be achieved with simple wholesale pricing schemes: either
   retailer-specific constant unit wholesale prices or retailer-specific
   volume discount schemes. We confine ourselves to two-echelon supply
   chains with a single supplier servicing a network of retailers who
   compete with each other by selecting sales quantities. We identify a key
   sufficient condition, in terms of interdependencies between chain
   members' operational decisions, under which perfect coordination via
   simple schemes is feasible, under general cost and demand functions.
   This condition, which we refer to as echelon operational autonomy (EOA),
   states that the costs incurred by the supplier for a given vector of
   sales volumes depends only on operational decisions she controls
   herself. At the same time, the costs incurred by the retailers may
   depend on operational decisions controlled by the supplier, in which
   case, the supplier's operational decisions are made to minimize
   chainwide costs. We show how vendor-managed inventory (VMI) partnerships
   create EOA and compare the resulting coordinating pricing schemes with
   those required in a traditional decentralized setting (without EOA). We
   also discuss compliance issues with the coordinating schemes in view of
   the Robinson-Patman act and provide remedies to overcome these issues.

AB The author considers a model of a decentralized distribution system
   consisting of n retailers selling an identical product. Retailers face a
   stochastic demand and must order their initial inventory before this
   demand is realized. After demand realization, retailers decide how much
   of their unsold inventory or unsatisfied demand they want to share with
   other retailers. This is followed by a transshipment of leftover
   inventories and distribution of the additional profit generated through
   inventory sharing.
   The author addresses the following issue: Suppose that the retailers
   distribute the profit from inventory sharing according to an allocation
   rule that induces retailers to share their residuals in a way that
   maximizes the additional profit, such as the Shapley value, but may not
   belong to the core. Is it likely that, in this framework, all retailers
   will jointly share their residuals and not form subcoalitions? Previous
   research has looked at this problem from a myopic viewpoint and
   concluded that the grand coalition is not stable. Unlike the prior work,
   the author looks at stability in a farsighted sense. That is, retailers
   do not consider only their immediate payoffs but are also concerned with
   reactions of other retailers to their actions. In a symmetric setting,
   with identical additional unit revenues from transshipments generated by
   all retailers, farsighted retailers always maximize their allocations by
   not defecting from the grand coalition. The author also provides
   conditions when the same is true for nonidentical additional unit
   revenues.

   that firms take today influence the costliness and effectiveness of

   informal agreements (relational contracts) that are sustained not by the
   court system, but by the ongoing value of the relationship. We
   characterize the optimal relational contract in this dynamic system with
   double moral hazard. We show that an optimal relational contract has a
   simple form that does not depend on the past history. The optimal
   relational contract may require that the firms terminate their
   relationship with positive probability following poor performance. We
   show how process visibility, which allows the firms to better assess who
   is at fault, can substantially improve system performance. The degree to
   which process visibility eliminates the need for termination depends on
   the nature of the dynamics: If the buyer's action does not influence the
   dynamics, the need for termination is eliminated; otherwise, termination
   may be required.

   that the optimal assortment consists of products equally spaced out such
   that there is no substitution among them regardless of the distribution
   of consumer preferences. The optimal solution can be such that some
   customers prefer not to buy any product in the assortment, and such that
   the most popular product is not offered. We then obtain bounds on profit
   when customers dynamically substitute, using the static substitution for
   the lower bound, and a retailer-controlled substitution for the upper
   bound. We thus define two heuristics to solve the problem under dynamic

   shows the value of modeling dynamic substitution and identifies

   hold independently of the customer demand. The authors also characterize
   the stream of orders placed at any stage of the chain when the customer

AB This paper extends our previous studies on the assimilation of
   Internet-based e-business innovations by firms in an international
   setting. Drawing upon theories on the process and contexts of technology
   diffusion, we develop an integrative model to examine three assimilation
   stages: initiation -> adoption -> routinization. The model features
   technological, organizational, and environmental contexts as prominent
   antecedents of this three-stage assimilation process. Based on this
   model, we hypothesize how technology readiness, technology integration,
   firm size, global scope, managerial obstacles, competition intensity,
   and regulatory environment influence e-business assimilation at the firm
   level. A unique data set of 1,857 firms from 10 countries is used to
   test the conceptual model and hypotheses. To probe deeper into the
   influence of the environmental context, we compare two subsamples from
   developed and developing countries. Our empirical analysis leads to
   several key findings: (1) Competition positively affects initiation and
   adoption, but negatively impacts routinization, suggesting that too much
   competition is not necessarily good for technology assimilation because
   it drives firms to chase the latest technologies without learning how to
   use existing ones effectively. (2) Large firms tend to enjoy resource
   advantages at the initiation stage, but have to overcome structural
   inertia in later stages. (3) We also find that economic environments
   shape innovation assimilation: Regulatory environment plays a more
   important role in developing countries than in developed countries.
   Moreover, while technology readiness is the strongest factor
   facilitating assimilation in developing countries, technology
   integration turns out to be the strongest in developed countries,
   implying that as e-business evolves, the key determinant of its
   assimilation shifts from accumulation to integration of technologies.
   Together, these findings offer insights into how innovation assimilation
   is influenced by contextual factors, and how the effects may vary across
   different stages and in different environments.

   consumer surplus. There are three main results. First, if every firm's
   manipulation strategy is a monotonically increasing (decreasing)
   function of that firm's true quality, strategic manipulation of online
   forums increases (decreases) the information value of a forum to
   consumers. This result implies the existence of settings where online
   forum manipulation benefits consumers. Second, equilibria where
   strategies are monotonically increasing (decreasing) functions of a
   firm's true quality exist in settings where the firm's net payoff
   function, inclusive of the cost of manipulation, is supermodular
   (submodular) in the firm's quality and manipulation action. Third, in a
   broad class of settings, if the precision of honest consumer opinions
   that firms manipulate is sufficiently high, firms of all types, as well
   as society, would be strictly better off if manipulation of online
   forums was not possible. Nonetheless, firms are locked into a "rat race"
   and forced to spend resources on such profit-reducing activities; if
   they don't, consumer perceptions will be biased against them. The social
   cost of online manipulation can be reduced by developing "filtering"
   technologies that make it costlier for firms to manipulate.
   Interestingly, as the amount of user-contributed online content
   increases, it is firms, and not consumers, that have most to gain from
   the development of such technologies.

AB Our objective is to understand the cross-category effects of marketing
   activities using aggregate store-level scanner data. For this, we
   provide a framework derived from household utility maximizing behavior
   which assumes that a household chooses the "bundle" of products with the
   highest utility. We use a second-order Taylor series approximation to an
   arbitrary utility function to represent bundle utility. Aggregate sales
   or shares in each category are derived under the assumption that
   households are heterogeneous in their preferences and in their
   sensitivities to marketing activities. Our estimation accounts for
   potential price endogeneity in demand. Using store-level scanner data on
   four product categories-liquid laundry detergents, powdered laundry
   detergents, liquid fabric softeners, and sheet fabric softeners-we find
   evidence for a complementary relationship between liquid softeners and
   both forms of detergents. We also find that the magnitude of
   cross-category elasticities are brand specific, i.e., different brands
   in a category have a different price impact on the demand for a brand in
   another category. The results have implications for retailers in terms
   of the potential need for cross-category management, as well as for
   manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble that participate in all four
   categories. We compare our model with a log-log regression specification
   on three criteria-estimated elasticities, hold-out sample predictions,
   and retailer cross-category pricing. We find that the proposed model
   produces more reasonable estimates relative to the log-log model; it
   predicts better and is more useful for pricing purposes. Further, in a
   simulation study, we show that our proposed model can recover the
   elasticities from a data-generating process that simulates
   household-level joint outcomes across categories even after these data
   have been aggregated to brand-level shares within each category By
   contrast, the log-log regression model is unable to do so.

AB Count data arise in various organizational settings. When the release of
   such data is sensitive, organizations need information-disclosure
   policies that protect data confidentiality while still providing data
   access. In contrast to extant disclosure policies, we describe a new
   policy for count tables that is based on disclosing only the sufficient
   statistics of a flexible discrete distribution. This distribution, the
   COM-Poisson, well approximates Poisson counts but also under- and
   over-dispersed counts. The sufficient statistics mask the exact cell
   counts and often also the table size. Under the scenario of a data
   holding agency and a data snooper, we show that this policy has low
   disclosure risk with no loss of data utility: Usually, many count tables
   correspond to the disclosed sufficient statistics. Furthermore, these
   count tables are equally likely to be the undisclosed table. Finding
   these solutions requires solving a system of linear equations, which are
   underdetermined for tables with more than three cells, and can be
   computationally prohibitive for even small tables. We also consider
   cell-specific interval bounds, a commonly used disclosure limitation
   policy, and compare them to our policy. We describe several types of
   snooper knowledge, their integration with the disclosed statistics, and
   implications. Applying this policy to three real data sets, we
   illustrate the low associated disclosure risk.

AB The author analyzes banks' incentives to acquire expertise in judging
   the creditworthiness of borrowers in an industry with uncertain business
   conditions. The analysis shows that industry expertise enables banks to
   extract rents proportional to their exposure to industry-specific credit
   risk. This exposure is in turn determined by the number of banks aiming
   to focus on lending to an industry. In equilibrium, the industry
   receives funding from a limited number of banks with industry expertise,
   as well as from a competitive fringe of financiers without such
   expertise. The equilibrium yields testable predictions about the
   concentration of bank lending to an industry, and about the correlation
   between this concentration and the recovery rates, default rates, and
   interest rates of bank loans.

AB The task allocation problem (TAP) is one where a number of tasks or
   modules need to be assigned to a set of processors or machines at
   minimum overall cost. The overall cost includes the communication cost
   between tasks that are assigned to different processors and other costs
   such as the assignment cost and the fixed cost of using processors.
   Processors may have limited or unlimited capacities to perform tasks.
   Task allocation has been applied to the design of distributed computing
   systems and also in auto-manufacturing contexts. We present several
   integer programs and a column generation formulation for the
   uncapacitated and the capacitated TAP. Computational experiments are
   carried out to demonstrate computational capabilities of integer
   programming and the column generation formulations for the uncapacitated
   TAP (UTAP). Excellent results are obtained for the column generation
   formulation. We also report some computational experience for the
   capacitated TAP (CTAP).

AB In kidney allocation, transplant candidates may have private information
   about their propensity to enjoy good outcomes after transplantation or
   about their relative expected improvement in quality of life after
   transplantation. This paper develops a mechanism design model to
   investigate the effect of such information asymmetry on the kidney
   allocation system. In this model, there are n transplant queues
   corresponding to n candidate types. Candidate types are only observed by
   the candidates, and each candidate chooses the queue to join by
   reporting a type. Kidneys have heterogeneous types, and each kidney will
   be assigned to one of the queues depending on its type. Candidates
   report their type strategically to join the queue that maximizes their
   utility. Candidate utility depends on the type of kidney received and
   the expected waiting time, which is calculated using fluid
   approximations. We consider two alternative social welfare functions:
   aggregate utility (emphasizing efficiency) and minimum utility across
   all candidates (emphasizing equity). The kidney allocation problem is to
   divide the organ supply among the different queues so that social
   welfare is maximized, and this problem is solved explicitly under both
   objective functions. There are three findings: (1) The allocation
   mechanism induces truth telling by ensuring that candidates who wait
   longer receive better kidneys; (2) Information rents are earned by
   high-risk candidates under the efficiency objective and by low-risk
   candidates under the equity objective; (3) a choice-based kidney
   allocation system in which candidates choose the type of queue to join
   leads to outcomes in the middle of the efficiency-equity spectrum.

AB Research on exploration and exploitation is burgeoning, yet our
   understanding of the antecedents and consequences of both activities
   remains rather unclear. We advance the growing body of literature by
   focusing on the apparent differences of exploration and exploitation and
   examining implications for using formal (i.e., centralization and
   formalization) and informal (i.e., connectedness) coordination
   mechanisms. This study further examines how environmental aspects (i.e.,
   dynamism and competitiveness) moderate the effectiveness of exploratory
   and exploitative innovation. Results indicate that centralization
   negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization
   positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly,
   connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both
   exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, our findings
   reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic
   environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more
   beneficial to a unit's financial performance in more competitive
   environments. Through this richer explanation and empirical assessment,
   we contribute to a greater clarity and better understanding of how
   ambidextrous organizations coordinate the development of exploratory and
   exploitative innovation in organizational units and successfully respond
   to multiple environmental conditions.

   a biotechnology-based process innovation in nylon manufacturing, we
   consider a technology provider that develops and introduces innovations
   to a market of industrial customers-original equipment manufacturers
   (OEMs). The technology employed by these OEMs determines the performance
   quality of the end product they manufacture, which in turn forms the
   basis of competition among them. Within this context of downstream
   competition, we examine the technology provider's introduction
   strategies when improving technologies are introduced sequentially. We
   develop a two-period game-theoretic framework to account for the
   strategic considerations of the parties involved (i.e., the technology
   provider and the OEMs). Our main result indicates that the technology
   provider may find it beneficial to induce partial adoption of the new
   technology, depending on the technological progress the provider intends
   to offer in the future. We analyze many technology-specific and
   market-related characteristics-such as volume-based pricing for new
   component technologies, upgrade prices, and OEMs with differing
   capabilities-that correspond to various business settings. Our key
   result (i.e., partial adoption) proves to be a robust phenomenon. We
   also develop additional insights regarding the interactions between
   adoption and OEM capabilities.

AB We analyze the effect of managerial compensation schemes and

   competitive product markets. Previous research suggests that in cases of
   strategic substitutability firms tend to choose organizational
   structures and compensation systems that commit the firm to behaving
   aggressively in the product market, reducing firm and industry profits.
   In contrast, we show that while compensation and structure in isolation
   lead to excessive aggressiveness, the combination of these two internal
   choice variables may reverse the outcome-organizational design can be
   used as a commitment device to reduce competitive rivalry Finally, we
   find that in equilibrium, firms may choose to be different; one firm is
   decentralized and uses incentives that commit it to being aggressive,
   while the other is centralized and uses incentives that commit it to
   being soft. Hence, endogenous firm heterogeneity in the form of
   organizational differentiation allows firms to avoid a mutually
   detrimental outcome.

   externalities. For proprietary software or freeware, we compare four
   alternative policies to manage network security: (i) consumer
   self-patching (where no external incentives are provided for patching or
   purchasing); (ii) mandatory patching; (iii) patching rebate; and (iv)
   usage tax. We show that for proprietary software, when the software
   security risk and the patching costs are high, for both a
   welfare-maximizing social planner and a profit-maximizing vendor, a
   patching rebate dominates the other policies. However, when the patching
   cost or the security risk is low, self-patching is best. We also show
   that when a rebate is effective, the profit-maximizing rebate is
   decreasing in the security risk and increasing in patching costs. The
   welfare-maximizing rebates are also increasing in patching costs, but
   can be increasing in the effective security risk when patching costs are
   high. For freeware, a usage tax is the most effective policy except when
   both patching costs, and security risk are low, in which case a patching
   rebate prevails. Optimal patching rebates and taxes tend to increase
   with increased security risk and patching costs, but can decrease in the
   security risk for high-risk levels. Our results suggest that both the
   value generated from software and vendor profits can be significantly
   improved by mechanisms that target user incentives to maintain software

   between the plants. In our research, network analysis has been used as a
   methodology for understanding the position of plants in international
   manufacturing networks. The focus has been primarily on the intangible
   knowledge network, and secondarily on the physical, logistic network.
   Our analysis leads to four types of plants with different network roles:
   the isolated plants, the receivers, the hosting network players, and the
   active network players. Our analysis shows that the different types of
   plants play a different strategic role in the company, have a different
   focus, and differ in age, autonomy, and level of resources and
   investments. Also, the analysis suggests that the evolution of the plant
   depends to some extent on the network role of the plant. Finally, two
   scenarios for the development of a strong network role are identified.
   The research is useful for the scholar studying the architecture of
   knowledge networks, as well as for the practitioner who is in charge of

AB T here is now an extensive theoretical literature investigating optimal
   inventory policies for retailers. Yet several recent reviews have
   recognized that these models are rarely applied in practice. One
   explanation for the paucity of practical applications is the difficulty
   of measuring how stockouts affect both current and future demand. In
   this paper, we report the findings of a large-scale field test that
   measures the short- and long-run opportunity cost of a stockout. The
   findings confirm that the adverse impact of a stockout extends to both
   other items in the current order as well as future orders.
   We show how the findings can be used to provide input to inventory
   planning models and illustrate how failing to account for the long-run
   effects of a stockout will lead to suboptimal inventory decisions. We
   also demonstrate how the findings can be used in a customer lifetime
   value model. Finally, the study investigates the effectiveness of
   different responses that firms can offer to mitigate the cost of
   stockouts. There is considerable variation in the effectiveness of these
   responses. Offering discounts to encourage customers to backorder rather
   than cancel their orders is widely used in practice, but that was the
   least profitable of the responses that we evaluated. The findings have
   important implications for retailers considering the use of discounts as
   a response to stockouts.

AB Pricing and quantity decisions are critical to many firms across
   different industries. We study the joint price/quantity newsvendor model
   where only a single quantity and price decision is made, such as a
   fashion or holiday product that cannot be replenished and where the
   price is advertised nationally and cannot be changed. Demand is
   uncertain and sensitive to price. We develop a method for easily finding
   the optimal price and quantity that applies to more general cases than
   the usual one in which uncertainty is either additive, multiplicative,
   or a combination of the two. We represent a quantity by its fractile of
   the probability distribution of demand for a given price. We use a
   standard approach to approximating a given distribution with a finite
   number of representative fractiles and assume that these fractile
   functions are piecewise linear functions of the price. We identify
   effects that are not usually seen in a joint price/quantity newsvenclor
   model. For example, although the optimal quantity is a decreasing
   function of the unit cost, the optimal price can be nonmonotone in the
   unit cost and we shed insight into why. We illustrate that using a
   simplified structure of demand uncertainty can result in substantially
   lower profits.

   sharply different implications; for example, the power law predicts that
   the ratio of market shares for two successively ranked brands becomes
   smaller as one progresses from higher-ranked to lower-ranked brands,
   whereas the exponential form predicts that this ratio is a constant. Our
   findings have several managerial and research implications, which we
   summarize.

AB We develop a game-theoretical model to show that in the markets where
   price consistency across channels is critical, an incumbent
   brick-and-mortar retailer can deter the online entry of a pure-play
   e-tailer by strategically refraining from entering online. In the
   markets where price consistency is not a constraint, we find that the
   incumbent can deter the e-tailer's entry only if it enters online and
   credibly operates the online channel as an independent profit center. In
   other words, the incumbent must be willing to cannibalize its own
   brick-and-mortar business by charging a low online price. We also
   discuss some social welfare implications of retail online entry and the
   managerial insights of our analysis.

AB This paper examines the link between a supplier's marketing and service
   operations and its business customers' subsequent repatronage behavior.
   We develop a dynamic model of service contract renewal for an individual
   firm, at the contract level, recognizing interdependencies among service
   contract renewal decisions due to the firm's purchase of multiple
   contracts from the same supplier. The decision to renew a service
   contract is modeled as a function of service quality and price, where
   service quality is measured by the supplier's service operations metrics
   over time. By incorporating longitudinal data about the supplier's
   service operations, this study investigates how average service levels,
   variability in service levels (especially extreme outcomes), and timing
   of service delivery influence firms' service contract renewal decisions.
   The study context is support services for high-technology systems in
   business markets in Germany and the United Kingdom, where service
   operations metrics over time typically have skewed distributions. Firm
   behavior is represented by a binary choice model at the contract level,
   estimated as a binary response model with a complementary log-log link
   function incorporating random intercepts. The study shows that a firm
   that has a few extremely favorable experiences for a given service
   contract is more likely to subsequently renew that service contract,
   after controlling for average service levels. Firms weigh recent
   experiences (i.e., within the past year)-rather than earlier
   experiences-when deciding whether or not to renew, so the timing of
   service experiences may be critical to the survival of buyer-seller
   relationships. Overall, the study suggests that models of customer
   retention should incorporate the extent, variability, and timing of a
   supplier's service delivery over time at the contract/product level.

AB Technology innovations continue to be one of the greatest drivers of
   economic growth. Realizing the value of such innovations, however,
   requires substantial follow-on investments in development and
   commercialization. The value of these investments is difficult to
   capture because of uncertain demand and potential competition. This
   often leads to difficulties in obtaining outside financing for these
   investments. In this paper, we explore how licensing contracts can both
   dissuade other firms from developing alternative technologies and
   alleviate the financing problem. We develop a model in which a firm that
   invests in the development efforts of an innovation can license its
   technology to a potential competitor. A variety of licensing
   possibilities is considered, including fixed fees, royalty schedules,
   and two-part licenses consisting of an up-front payment and a capped
   royalty schedule. When the firm has no financial constraint, a royalty
   schedule that depends on realized demand dominates a fixed fee per
   license. When investment funds are constrained, a royalty cap license
   with an up-front payment can serve as a source of financing. We also
   study the investment problem conditional on the licensing and financing
   decisions.

AB The literature on network effects has popularized a hypothesis that
   competition between incompatible technologies results in the
   "winner-take-all" outcome. For the survival of the firm in this sort of
   competition, the installed base has been emphasized. We argue that the
   validity of this hypothesis depends on how customers interact with one
   another (e.g., if they exchange advice or files). In some interaction
   networks, customers influenced by their acquaintances may adopt a
   lagging technology even when a lead technology has built a large
   installed base. The presence of such a local bias facilitates the
   persistence of incompatibilities. When local bias cannot be sustained in
   other interaction networks, one technology corners the market. Our study
   suggests that overemphasizing the installed base, while ignoring network
   structure, could mislead practitioners.

AB Despite considerable empirical research, results on the relationships
   among constructs related to information system (IS) success, as well as
   the determinants of IS success, are often inconsistent. A comprehensive
   understanding of IS success thus remains elusive. In an attempt to
   address this situation, which may partly be due to the exclusion of
   potentially important constructs from prior parsimonious models of IS
   success, we present and test a comprehensive theoretical model. This
   model explains interrelationships among four constructs representing the
   success of a specific IS (user satisfaction, system use, perceived
   usefulness, and system quality), and the relationships of these IS
   success constructs with four user-related constructs (user experience
   with ISs, user training in ISs, user attitude toward ISs, and user
   participation in the development of the specific IS) and two constructs
   representing the context (top-management support for ISs and
   facilitating conditions for ISs). To test the model, we first used
   meta-analysis to compute a correlation matrix for the constructs in the
   model based on 612 findings from 121 studies published between 1980 and
   2004, and then used this correlation matrix as input for a LISREL
   analysis of the model. Overall, we found excellent support for the
   theoretical model. The results underline the importance of user-related
   and contextual attributes in IS success and raise questions about some
   commonly believed relationships.

AB Despite recurring concerns about common method variance (CMV) in survey
   research, the information systems (IS) community remains largely
   uncertain of the extent of such potential biases. To address this
   uncertainty, this paper attempts to systematically examine the impact of
   CMV on the inferences drawn from survey research in the IS area. First,
   we describe the available approaches for assessing CMV and conduct an
   empirical study to compare them. From an actual survey involving 227
   respondents, we find that although CMV is present in the research areas
   examined, such biases are not substantial. The results also suggest that
   few differences exist between the relatively new marker-variable
   technique and other well-established conventional tools in terms of
   their ability to detect CMV. Accordingly, the marker-variable technique
   was employed to infer the effect of CMV on correlations from previously
   published studies. Our findings, based on the reanalysis of 216
   correlations, suggest that the inflated correlation caused by CMV may be
   expected to be on the order of 0.10 or less, and most of the originally
   significant correlations remain significant even after controlling for
   CMV. Finally, by extending the marker-variable technique, we examined
   the effect of CMV on structural relationships in past literature. Our
   reanalysis reveals that contrary to the concerns of some skeptics,
   CMV-adjusted structural relationships not only remain largely
   significant but also are not statistically differentiable from
   uncorrected estimates. In summary, this comprehensive and systematic
   analysis offers initial evidence that (1) the marker-variable technique
   can serve as a convenient, yet effective, tool for accounting for CMV,
   and (2) common method biases in the IS domain are not as serious as
   those found in other disciplines.

AB We consider the impact of variable production costs on competitive
   behavior in a duopoly where manufacturers compete on quality and price
   in a two-stage game. In the pricing stage, we make no assumptions
   regarding these costs-other than that they are positive and increasing
   in quality-and no assumptions about whether or not the market is
   covered. In the quality stage, we investigate a broad family of variable
   cost functions and show how the shape of these functions impacts
   equilibrium product positions, profits, and market coverage. We find
   that seemingly slight changes to the cost function's curvature can
   produce dramatically different equilibrium outcomes, including the
   degree of quality differentiation, which competitor is more profitable
   (the one offering higher or lower quality), and the nature of the market
   itself (covered or uncovered). Our model helps to predict and explain
   the diversity of outcomes we see in practice-something the previous
   literature has been unable to do.
