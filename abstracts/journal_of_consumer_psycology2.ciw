AB Past research (Kruger, Wirtz, Van Boven, & Altermatt, 2004) proposed
   that people use the effort of the producer as a heuristic for the
   quality of the product, In contrast, two experiments show that
   consumers' inferences from effort information are highly malleable.
   Participants were either explicitly exposed to one of two applicable
   naive theories ("good-art-takes-effort" vs. "good-art-takes-talent") or
   the order of judgment was reversed (quality judgment first vs. talent
   judgment first) to activate different naive theories more subtly. In
   both cases, participants only inferred high quality from high effort
   when an "effort" theory was rendered accessible, but not when a "talent"
   theory was rendered accessible. We conclude that judgment tasks prime
   naive theories that can serve as inference rules, illustrating that
   heuristics can be constructed on the spot. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer

AB We investigate a tool, namely visual art, which enables firms to
   increase the extendibility of their brands. Extant research proposes
   that successful brand extensions depend on favorable brand image and
   high perceived fit between the brand and the extension category. We
   propose that the presence of art has a positive influence on brand image
   (via a transfer of luxury perceptions from art onto the brand) and
   enhances perceived fit (via increased cognitive flexibility), resulting
   in more favorable brand extension evaluations. A pilot study and two
   experiments demonstrate that the presence of visual art favorably
   influences brand image perceptions and enhances perceptions of category
   fit. Mediation analysis reveals that together these factors explain the
   influence of visual art on brand extendibility. (c) 2008 Society for

AB Consumers may bring two implicit theories to bear on their
   interpretation of an advertisement: the theory that communications in
   general are intended to be informative and accurate and a
   domain-specific theory that ad claims are often exaggerated. The
   relative impact of these theories depends on both the ambiguity of the
   ad content and the motivation to think about its implications.
   Participants viewed ads describing the problem that a product purports
   to solve and the results of using it. When the ad's implications were
   ambiguous, participants interpreted the ad's literal implications in a
   way that was plausible but they were unmotivated to expend the
   additional effort required to invoke the theory that ad claims are
   exaggerated. Consequently, they evaluated the product favorably. When
   the product's literal implications were easy to construe, however,
   participants' implicit theory that ad claims are exaggerated had the
   predominant influence on their liking for the product. The relative
   impact of participants' implicit theories was influenced by both the
   cognitive load that participants experienced at the time they viewed the
   ad and by unobtrusively priming theory-related concepts before the ad
   was presented. (c) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB This article examines consumer perception of transactions whose benefits
   Of Consumption and cost of purchase unfold over time. Specifically, the
   article employs the notion of narrow framing to suggest that, when
   consumers confront a series of decisions, they tend to make evaluations
   one at a time, rather than take into consideration the entire portfolio.
   Consistent with this argument, the authors test the pattern alignment
   hypothesis, which states that consumers prefer payment schemes that
   match the pattern of benefits and payments in each period, rather than a
   scheme that encompasses ail entire financing period. In two experiments,
   the authors find general support for the pattern alignment hypothesis
   and for the underlying process by which this hypothesis occurs.
   Specifically, Experiment 2 highlights the mediating role of consumers'
   perceived fairness in determining the effectiveness of a financing
   program. The paper Concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and
   practical implications of developing financing and pricing strategies
   that promote the perception of fairness. (C) 2008 Society for Consumer

AB Causal attribution and appraisal are two types of cognition that mediate
   how events influence emotional reactions. Whereas the former is a "cold"
   cognition that relies on fact-based processing, the latter is a "hot"
   cognition that depends on how those facts affect personal well being.
   The current research investigates the relative contribution of
   attribution, primary appraisal (e.g., motivational relevance and goal
   congruence), and secondary appraisal (e.g., situational inferences
   affecting the intensity of an emotion) to four agent-based emotions:
   anger, shame, gratitude, and pride. A sporting event context was
   selected because game information is objectively neutral and acquires
   meaning only when interpreted through a lens that favors a preferred
   team. Two studies arc reported, each consisting of two independent data
   collections in which a target team either wins or loses. The first study
   uses a naturalistic setting and the second an experimental approach. The
   results of three of the four data collections indicate that appraisal is
   a more efficient predictor of emotion than attribution. Appraisal also
   mediated the effect of attribution on the negative emotions, but only
   partial mediation was found for the positive emotions. Moreover,
   secondary appraisal was more highly related to negative emotion but the
   contribution of each appraisal type to positive emotion was nearly
   equivalent. Also, in Study 2, emotion intensity was significantly
   greater following a controllable Outcome deemed unstable than one
   thought to be stable-but Only for games featuring a preferred team for
   which motivational relevance (i.e., psychological attachment) exists.

AB Research shows that asking questions can fundamentally change behavior.
   We review literature on this question-behavior effect, which
   demonstrates that asking questions changes both normal and risky
   behaviors. We discuss potential explanations for the effect and review
   recent findings that reveal interesting moderators of the influence of
   questions on behavior. We then highlight the potential impact of the
   question-behavior effect in an important public health context:
   screening adolescents for risky behavior. While medical guidelines
   emphasize the importance of asking adolescents questions about substance
   (drug, alcohol) use and sexual behaviors, research on the
   question-behavior effect suggests that asking adolescents about risky
   behaviors has the potential to increase the frequency with which they
   engage in these behaviors. We argue that the act of screening or
   measuring risky behavior is potentially counterproductive. We emphasize
   the importance of interventions beyond screening, and suggest ways in
   which screening can be carried out to minimize its impact. in short,
   asking questions about behaviors can change behavior, and asking
   questions about risky behaviors may itself be a risky undertaking. (C)

   considerable knowledge and experience to compensate for the impact of
   any age-related changes in abilities and resources. When the fit is
   relatively low, older consumers feel increased need to adapt their
   decision making processes. We discuss these consumer adaptations and
   propose a number of research questions related to the processes
   underlying them in order to contribute to a better understanding of how

   abilities change across the adult life span while others do not. Some of

   One is accommodation, which entails designing information processing and
   judgment tasks so that they are compatible with the elderly's resource
   limitations. The other strategy involves Stimulating self-regulation.
   Here the premise is that elderly individuals often have the resources
   necessary to engage in a task, but only activate them in response to
   explicit directions. We discuss whether this observation reflects older
   individuals' inability to activate self-regulation strategies

AB Efforts to assist older adults with cognitive deficits can take one of
   three paths: law, education or marketing. Legal protections have proved
   insufficient. Government educational efforts are typically dryly factual
   and likely to go unheeded. With the growing size of the older adult
   market, the independent efforts of both for-profit and social marketers
   to develop products and services that can help this population remain
   functionally healthy and independent are likely to be successful. Both
   governments and insurance companies should be motivated to help
   subsidize these entrepreneurial efforts given the considerably higher
   costs of caring for the elderly in an institution. (C) 2008 Society for

AB In word-of-mouth marketing, marketers often provide financial rewards
   for referrals. These rewards introduce a financial motive into an
   interaction among friends or acquaintances, which may harm the perceived
   sincerity of the referring customer. We show that this negative effect
   can be mitigated by disclosing the presence of financial motives, but
   also by the activation of a market pricing ('sales') relationship norm.
   However, such a norm has a negative effect on compliance with the
   referral. The effects of relationship norms are strongest when cognitive
   capacity is impaired, which suggests that the influence of relationship
   norms occurs outside the awareness of consumers. Conversely, the impact
   of disclosures is stronger when consumers have full cognitive capacity
   available. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB This research examines consumer replacement decisions and the
   ambivalence that may accompany such decisions. Durable goods replacement
   decisions are complex in that they involve two interconnected but
   distinct subdecisions: whether to replace the good, and what to do with
   the incumbent possession. This research proposes and tests a decision
   model that incorporates both of these subdecisions. It also examines
   sources of conflict associated with the ambivalence that may accompany
   replacement decisions, In so doing, it describes some potential problems
   associated with conflict measures that have been previously used in the
   ambivalence literature and describes methods to avoid these problems.
   Findings from a longitudinal study demonstrate that a model
   incorporating elements of both replacement subdecisions offers superior
   prediction of intentions over a traditional decision model. Findings
   also reveal that ambivalence may have effects at both the pre- and
   post-purchase stages of the decision process, and that the relationship
   between conflict and ambivalence may be more complex than previously
   recognized. (C) 2008 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

   attribution model of spokesperson familiarity was tested. Specifically,
   it was hypothesized that repeated exposure to a spokesperson would
   create fluency that, in a persuasive context, could be attributed to the
   persuasive message or to another fluency-relevant cue (e.g., the fame of
   the spokesperson). In three experiments a woman's photo was repeatedly
   presented, and subsequently accompanied a persuasive message. Consistent
   with hypotheses, inflated ratings of the message followed repeated
   spokesperson exposure (compared to a no exposure control) but only when
   inflated ratings of the spokesperson (fame) or her photo (perceptual
   clarity) were not observed. Discussion focuses on implications for
   familiarity theories and on guidelines for maximizing the influence of

AB Consumers frequently evaluate multiple sequential cues of varying
   strengths in order to draw inferences about a product's quality. The
   results of three experiments show that when consumers are not
   distracted, they judge a product's quality more favorably following a
   strong-weak cue sequence relative to a weak-strong sequence (a primacy
   effect). However once consumers are distracted from the evaluation task,
   the primacy effect reverses to a recency effect, whereby consumers judge
   a product's quality more favorably following a weak-strong cue sequence.
   Process tests suggest that distraction crowds consumers' short-term
   working memory and inhibits the spontaneous rehearsal and the subsequent
   recall of the cue presented first in the information sequence. (C) 2008

AB Regulatory engagement theory [Higgins, E. T. (2006). Value from hedonic
   experience and engagement. Psychological Review, 113, 439-460.] proposes
   that value is a motivational force of attraction to or repulsion from
   something, and that strength of engagement contributes to value
   intensity independent of hedonic and other sources of value direction.
   This paper reviews different sources of engagement strength, including
   dealing with challenges by opposing interfering forces and overcoming
   personal resistance, preparing for something that is likely to happen,
   and using "fit" or "proper" means of goal pursuit. We present evidence
   that each of these sources of engagement strength can intensify the
   value of something, and we show how stronger engagement can not only
   make something positive more positive but also make something negative
   more negative. We also discuss how these effects of stronger engagement
   on the value of something else are independent of actors' own personal
   experiences during goal pursuit. We then broaden regulatory engagement
   theory by describing the nature of these personal experiences from
   different sources of engagement strength-distinct positive experiences
   (e.g., feeling "pleasure" vs. feeling "right") and distinct negative
   experiences (e.g., feeling "tension" vs. feeling "defiance")-and
   consider the science and art of combining them with engagement strength
   for maximal persuasion and influence. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer

   involve more than one process. We conclude by suggesting that many

   multifinality, distance from the goal, inhibition upon goal fulfillment)

   linked to a higher perceived value and increased purchase likelihood.
   The effect is not observed for prices separated by large versus small

   studies support the proposition that a brand rated as objectively
   inferior to another can be subjectively perceived as equivalent to-or
   even better than-the same brand. Such anomalous response inconsistency
   originates in consumers' recourse to different expectations for the
   competing brands and their automatic adjustment of expectations for the
   inferior brand when responding to subjective measures. The implicit
   relaxing of evaluative standards for the objectively dominated brand
   leads to an unconscious upward bias in its subjective ratings. The

   these concepts could theoretically influence behavior through the
   elicitation of positive affect or via temporary changes in participants'
   self representations of how lucky they feel. An initial experiment
   showed that priming Asian consumers with lucky numbers independently
   influenced both their perceptions of personal luck and the positive
   affect they reported experiencing. Subsequent experiments, however,
   showed that the effect of these primes on consumer behavior was mediated
   by momentary changes in how lucky people felt (i.e. changes in the self
   concept) rather than by the positive affect they were experiencing at
   the time. Exposing consumers to lucky numbers influenced their estimates
   of how likely they were to win a lottery (Experiment 2), their
   willingness to participate in such a lottery (Experiment 4), their
   evaluations of different promotional strategies (Experiment 3), and also
   the amount of money they were willing to invest in different financial

AB This paper examines the existence and consequences of consumers'
   position-based beliefs about product layouts. We propose that consumers
   believe that options placed in the center of a simultaneously presented
   array are the most popular. This belief translates into their choosing
   options placed in the center more often than those on the sides of a
   display: the center-stage effect (Studies 1 and 5). Results are driven
   by inferences of product popularity rather than higher levels of
   attention to products in a given position (Studies 2 and 3). The
   preference for middle options is accentuated when people explicitly take
   into account other people's preferences, increasing the need to choose a
   popular option (Study 3), but attenuated when layout-based information
   is not diagnostic (Study 4). Increasing the accessibility of own
   preferences for the intrinsic attributes about the products reduces the
   use of position-based beliefs to make judgments and attenuates the
   center-stage effect (Study 5). Theoretical implications for marketplace
   meta-cognitions, visual information processing, position effects, and
   the use of overall cognitive beliefs versus perceptual attention and
   memory-based individuating information to make judgments are discussed.

AB Individualism is a fundamental value to U.S. culture and democracy. We
   differentiate the horizontal from vertical dimension of individualism to
   predict voting in the 2004 presidential election. Horizontal
   individualism (HI) values equality and uniqueness, whereas vertical
   individualism (VI) values competition and achievement. In line with the
   value-expressive function of attitudes and voter-politician congruency
   principles, we show how and when HI and VI affect voters' attitudes and
   voting. A pilot study revealed that VI correlated with vote; those who
   scored higher on VI were more likely to vote for Bush. Study I
   replicated these findings with a broader sample and a regression
   approach. The influence of individualism was less predictive than VI in
   both studies. In Study 2, we proposed that the effect of VI and HI
   values on voting decisions is mediated by political conservatism, which
   in turn predicts voters' trait assessment of candidates and voting
   decision. Path analysis of the data from a national survey supported our
   expectation among respondents with high political involvement, the
   context in which value-expressive attitudes are more pronounced. Taken
   together, these studies advance our theoretical understanding of HI, VI,
   and individualism, as well as the process underlying the effect of
   values on decisions. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

AB Encouraging consumers to engage in helpful behavior is a perennial task
   of marketers in non-profit and for-profit organizations. Recent research
   suggests that merely imagining the presence of others can lead to less
   helping behavior on a subsequent unrelated task (Garcia, S.M., Weaver,
   K.D., Moskowitz, G.B., and Darley, J.M. (2002). Crowded minds: The
   implicit bystander effect. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
   83, 843-853.). The present analysis uncovers the boundary conditions of
   this effect. Across four studies, we establish that the degree to which
   a group situation fosters public scrutiny is an important moderator.
   When group primes are paired with public scrutiny, their inhibitive
   effect on helping behavior diminishes, and helping behavior on a
   subsequent task tends to increase. The present research thus adds
   complexity to previous findings by suggesting that implicit bystanders
   can both decrease and increase helping behavior. (C) 2009 Society for

AB Choices are often identity-based but the linkage to identity is not
   necessarily explicit or obvious for a number of reasons. First,
   identities feel stable but are highly sensitive to situational cues.
   Second, identities include not only content but also readiness to act
   and to use procedures congruent with the identity. Third, identities can
   be subtly cued without conscious awareness. Fourth, what an accessible
   identity means is dynamically constructed in the particular context in
   which it is cued. Because identities carry action-and
   procedural-readiness, the outcome of an identity-based motivation
   process may be similar to or different from the choices an individual
   would have made in another setting. Moreover, once an identity is
   formed, action and procedural-readiness can be cued without conscious
   awareness or systematic processing, resulting in beneficial or
   iatrogenic outcomes. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

   about the relationship between the self and brand-related consumption.
   Two broad areas of investigation that can form an agenda for further
   research are proposed. The first area concerns the relationship among
   brands, identity and goals. The second area concerns the potential
   negative effects of identity on brand choice and on perceptions of
   identity-related behavior. Consumer researchers are best positioned to
   pursue issues dealing with the intersection of identity and brands,

AB While research on innovation and new product development abounds in the
   literature, studies on firms deleting brands from their portfolio are
   virtually non-existent. This paper provides a pioneering examination of
   how brand elimination might influence consumer evaluations of the firm.
   As compared to a widely-held belief that brand elimination would
   adversely affect firm image, we propose that in situations where brand
   elimination can be viewed as the firm's effort to improve performance,
   consumers will rate this action favorably, with concomitant outcomes
   relating to firm evaluation. These ideas are supported in three studies.
   Study 1 finds that elimination targeting a weak (vs. strong) brand is
   more likely to be associated with eliminate-to-improve attributions, and
   consequently, more favorable evaluations. Study 2 shows that
   explanations provided by the firm (as against explanations generated
   internally by the consumers) help consumers make positive attributions
   for elimination targeting a strong brand, but lower evaluations when a
   weak brand is being eliminated. Study 3 establishes that loyal consumers
   are more likely to assess the applicability of an 'eliminate-to-improve'
   attribution and give favorable evaluations only when the eliminated
   brand is weak. Non-loyal consumers in general respond favorably to the
   elimination, regardless of brand strength. Future directions for brand
   elimination research are discussed. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer

AB We argue that giving individuals a sense of choice over the product
   information they receive (i.e., message choice) can have important
   subsequent effects when individuals are prompted to make inferences
   about the company. Even when the product information that is received is
   exactly the same, being given a sense of choice can produce more
   favorable company evaluations and in turn, more favorable product
   judgments. The first two experiments support these hypotheses using
   different means of prompting company inferences: when prompted, those
   who had been given message choice judged the company more favorably and
   were more willing to purchase from that company. The third experiment
   illustrates when message choice effects can backfire. Specifically, when
   the company itself highlights the provision of message choice in the ad,
   and consumers are prompted to make inferences about the company, message
   choice can backfire because it may be perceived as a persuasion tactic
   rather than a sincere attempt to inform. The results support company
   evaluations as the mediator of message choice effects and rule out
   alternate accounts based on dissonance, elaboration, reactance and
   self-labeling explanations. These findings are important in interactive
   media environments where marketers have opportunities and imperatives to
   give consumers a sense of choice in message selection. (C) 2009 Society

   maintain associations with an identity-linked brand even when that

AB This research investigates the effects of refraining from a purchase
   temptation at one point in time on choices made at a subsequent
   opportunity to purchase or consume a tempting product. Four experiments
   involving scenarios and real decisions demonstrate that the salience of
   restraint at a prior impulse buying opportunity causes consumers to
   reward themselves subsequently by choosing indulgence over
   non-indulgence. We show that indulgence is likely to increase only when
   prior restraint is salient and hence can be used as a justification. As
   expected, an index of reasons for vs. against buying mediates the
   relationship between prior impulse purchase decision and indulgent
   choice. In further support of the mechanism, we find that prior
   indulgence can have the same effect as prior restraint, if the prior
   indulgence is made justifiable. Finally, we show that prior shopping
   restraint can increase indulgence without a corresponding increase in
   self-esteem. These findings extend our understanding of self-regulation
   and demonstrate that everyday consumer decisions such as responses to
   impulse buying opportunities can have consequential downstream effects.

AB Emotional antecedents of schadenfreude-joy experienced when observing
   another's downfall-were investigated in a status consumption context.
   Across 3 studies, status product failure produced schadenfreude and led
   to intentions to spread negative word-of-mouth (studies 1, 2), and
   increased negative affect and overall negative attitudes toward the
   status brand (study 3). Furthermore, studies 1 and 2 suggest that envy
   (particularly of social attention) can lead to schadenfreude by
   transmuting into hostile emotions. Finally, these studies suggest that
   schadenfreude in a consumption context can be precipitated by factors
   such as degree of target advantage and flaunting of the status product.

AB There is disagreement in the literature regarding whether those
   communicating in computer-mediated (CM) groups are attentive or
   oblivious to the social situation. There is evidence on both sides, with
   those in CM groups sometimes modifying their public responses and other
   times not. This apparent contradiction may be due in part to the
   impression that those in CM groups wish to convey and whether modifying
   their responses would help convey this impression. Specifically, whereas
   those in face-to-face (FTF) groups may strategically alter their public
   responses to present themselves as part of the group, those in CM groups
   may strategically alter their public responses to present themselves as
   separate from the group and unique on a positive dimension. The results
   of three experiments support this impression-management account: those
   in CM groups strategically altered their responses when doing so
   produced a desirable impression. The results further suggest that visual
   information about the group and social distance play important roles in
   affecting whether those in CM groups conform or not. (C) 2009 Society

   representations of brands (i.e., brand signatures) results in superior
   brand memory for individuals with lower literacy levels when compared to
   those at higher literacy levels. This effect is shown to occur not due
   to pictorial elements per se, but due to pictorial elements with a
   1-to-1 correspondence with reality, i.e., which match the form in which
   they were originally encoded in memory. Moreover, this effect does not
   persist with stimulus-rich pictures of brands in usage, pointing to

AB Scholars in social psychology and marketing have traditionally examined
   word-of-mouth (WOM) interactions in a dyadic setting, comprised of a
   WOM-opinion provider and its recipient. Yet, social interactions also
   often occur in larger settings, and group-based research has shown group
   sizes to affect its member behavior. To this end, we set out to examine
   WOM transmission in a larger context by introducing a WOM responder,
   whose role is to provide a second opinion to the WOM recipient. In
   Experiment 1, we find that social relations in the triad play a key role
   in WOM transmission. For strong ties, the WOM responder showed little
   difference in willingness to offer a second opinion irrespective of its
   congruency with the first opinion. Incongruency with the first opinion,
   however, reduced the valence of the second opinion. For weak ties, the
   presence (vs. absence) of first opinion-irrespective of its
   congruency-increased the likelihood of offering a second opinion and
   also its valence. We demonstrate that the effects could be attributable
   to different accessibility of needs for assimilation and differentiation
   as well as of motivational orientations toward other parties of WOM.
   Experiment 2 takes a closer look at the conflicting motivations of
   social influence (normative vs. informational) associated with strong
   ties, and finds both in operation but to a differing degree. Finally, a
   follow-up study addresses the current findings in the context of
   satisfied/dissatisfied consumers. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer

AB Consumers are often exposed to information that may contradict their

   rigorous test in three experiments. We find that post-consumption
   imagery makes it more difficult to discern between consumption and
   misleading information thereby boosting false recall. Yet, imagery that
   is more consumption-based helps reduce consumers' susceptibility to
   false memory. Consistent with this notion, we explicate the role that
   attention plays at different stages of consumption in affecting false

   inaction regret resulting in different behavioral outcomes. Prior
   research has focused on two outcomes of regret for inaction-inaction
   inertia and dissonance reduction-that result in the decreased intent to
   avail of a similar future opportunity. This research proposes that these
   are not inevitable outcomes, but rather coping responses. Further, if
   the forgone opportunity is appraised to be goal-relevant and reversible,
   consumers engage in active coping that results in increased behavioral

   symmetric priming effects should occur when similarities between the

AB Three studies show that consumer response to advertising depends on
   engagement with the media content, in this case a television program, in
   which the advertising appears. The specific form of engagement studied
   is the experience of narrative transportation, of being absorbed into
   the narrative world of the program. If an ad is not intrusive, by virtue
   of where it occurs in a narrative, high transportation is shown to
   positively impact an ad. This impact is obtained if the ad matches the
   narrative (thematically compatible), supporting the hypothesis that
   transportation can act as a message frame that increases processing. If
   a compatible ad is intrusive, however, it is shown that high
   transportation is disrupted and this negatively impacts an ad. A third
   study proposes and finds an additional mechanism, called transportation
   transference, in which high narrative transportation increases the
   transportation with an ad that is not intrusive and this increase in ad
   transportation in turn increases advertising effectiveness. (C) 2009

   dynamics of favorable and unfavorable professional phenomenology, which
   was developed based on a series of depth interviews with a diverse set
   of respondents. Core professional values typically shared by consumer
   psychologists are discussed, as are the roadblocks that cause
   disconnects between individuals' values and their professional

   traps that powerfully undermine professional happiness, and concludes
   with prescriptive advice for creating departments that facilitate the

AB Consumers sometimes act like creatures of habit, automatically repeating
   past behavior with little regard to current goals and valued outcomes.
   To explain this phenomenon, we show that habits are a specific forth of
   automaticity in which responses are directly cued by the contexts (e.g.,
   locations, preceding actions) that consistently covaried with past
   performance. Habits are prepotent responses that are quick to activate
   in memory over alternatives and that have a slow-to-modify memory trace.
   In daily life, the tendency to act on habits is compounded by everyday
   demands, including time pressures, distraction, and self-control
   depletion. However, habits are not immune to deliberative processes.
   Habits are learned largely as people pursue goals in daily life, and
   habits are broken through the strategic deployment of effortful
   self-control. Also, habits influence the post hoc inferences that people
   make about their behavior. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer Psychology.

   potential) associated with luxury brands is a key driver of brand
   extendibility. In four studies, we contrast a luxury brand with a value
   brand. Both brand concepts lead to equally favorable brand evaluations,
   but the luxury brand concept results in more favorable brand extension
   evaluations due to the hedonic potential inherent in this concept.
   However, the luxury brand is shown to be sensitive to inconsistent brand
   cues, leading to diminished hedonic potential and consequently decreased
   brand and brand extension evaluations. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer

   logic, such that the beauty of the model spills over directly onto
   product evaluations; thin models thus produce more favorable implicit

   harder to learn and remember than associations with enactment concepts).
   Two experiments support our predictions, suggesting that messages about

AB Researchers across many domains have examined the impact of externally
   presented numerical anchors on perceiver judgments. In the traditional
   paradigm, "anchored" judgments are typically explained as a result of
   elaborate thinking (i.e., confirmatory hypothesis testing that
   selectively activates anchor-consistent information in memory).
   Consistent with a long tradition in attitude change, we suggest that the
   same judgments can result from relatively thoughtful or non-thoughtful
   processes, with more thoughtful processes resulting in judgments that
   have more lasting impact. We review recent anchoring research consistent
   with this elaboration-based perspective and discuss implications for
   past anchoring results and theory in judgment and decision making. (C)

   to consider provided numbers as possible responses to a target judgment,
   Wegener et al. (2008) proposed that cognitive load affects the
   psychological mechanism by which these anchors influence judgments. We
   propose, instead, that level of cognitive resources does not
   fundamentally affect how anchoring works, but only whether respondents
   can access other considerations that bear on the target judgment. Though
   we share the authors' view that environmental circumstances can
   influence the relative contribution of associative and deliberative
   inputs in judgments, we contend that cognitive load primarily affects
   the types of information that respondents consider, not the manner by
   which a focal element is processed. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer

AB An attitudes and persuasion perspective can broaden our understanding of
   anchoring by highlighting sources of variability in anchoring effects
   that have been largely overlooked. As the target article suggests,
   research guided by this perspective can help identify (1) different
   types of anchors that exert their influence through different underlying
   mechanisms, 2) important social psychological moderators of anchoring
   effects, and 3) sources of variability in the consequences of anchoring
   for judgment and choice. In this commentary, we take an even broader
   perspective on the types of anchors that are likely to influence
   judgment, suggesting four potentially distinct types-intuitive
   approximations, best/worst case scenarios, environmental suggestions,
   and magnitude priming. We conclude by discussing how an attitudes and
   persuasion perspective on anchoring may provide novel insights into the
   moderators and consequences of anchoring effects in everyday life. (C)

AB Noted Judgment and Decision Making (JDM) researchers differ in their
   opinions of whether and how an attitudes and persuasion (A&P) view of
   anchoring might add to the existing anchoring literature. Epley and
   Gilovich (2010) and Russo (2010) supported the breadth of variables that
   an attitudinal view of brings to bear on anchoring phenomena and the
   potential operation of different psychological processes across
   different contexts. They also suggest extensions to other types of
   anchors (along with Frederick et al. 2010), to alternative paradigms,
   and to other classes of moderators, such as goals. Authors of all three
   commentaries wondered if the evidence we presented speaks to traditional
   issues related to processes underlying anchoring. Frederick et al.
   (2010) also took a different approach in suggesting that anchoring is
   always due to non-thoughtful processes despite the fact that thoughtful
   processes can also influence judgments. This approach diverges from
   prominent reviews of the anchoring literature and implies that the
   presence of any simple, associative mechanism makes the overall process
   that involves that mechanism "non-thoughtful." We discuss how this
   approach differs from our own, and we discuss the implications of the
   other observations in each commentary. (C) 2009 Society for Consumer

AB The authors find that a consumer's position in a social network is
   related to both opinion leadership and susceptibility to influence.
   Using two field network studies, the authors show that people see
   themselves as opinion leaders when they perceive that they are popular
   (i.e., central) in the network. However, these self-assessments are
   sometimes at odds with the perceptions of the rest of the network.
   Counter-intuitively, the authors demonstrate that consumers who are
   central in networks are quite susceptible to others' influences. The
   findings extend the field's knowledge by demonstrating how network
   centrality is associated with consumer influence. (C) 2009 Society for

   and reflect the assumption that individuals will respond positively to

   positive responses than inclusive offers, an outcome referred to as a
   deal exclusivity effect. Contrary to the intuition that targeted
   promotions will always be evaluated more favorably than inclusive
   offers, we show that deal exclusivity effects (1) can be attenuated
   based upon factors influencing the extent to which recipients identify
   with other deal recipients and (2) are mediated by the offer's ability

   obesity prosthesis, we show that the body type of a (confederate) server
   in a taste test study was sufficient to alter both the quantity
   (Experiment 1) and specific choices (Experiment 2) participants made but
   that chronic dieters and non-dieters exhibited opposite effects. While
   non-dieters ate more snacks when the server was thin, dieters ate more
   when the server was heavy. Dieters were also more persuaded by a heavy
   (vs. a thin) server, choosing both a healthy and unhealthy snack more
   often when she recommended it to them. We suggest these results may be
   attributable to identification with the server. (C) 2010 Society for

AB In response to recent calls for research into activities that may
   increase happiness, this study uses longitudinal data to investigate
   changes in within-subject, instead of between-subject, well-being. In
   the context of hedonic product consumption, this study reveals a
   mechanism by which consumption influences well-being through the
   mediating effect of satisfaction with associated life domains. Four
   years of data from a large national panel survey show that consuming
   hedonic products has indirect effects on well-being, by improving
   consumers' satisfaction within relevant life domains. High hedonic
   consumption improves satisfaction with relevant life domains, primarily
   through more frequent consumption of low-cost hedonic products rather
   than less frequent consumption of high-cost hedonic products. (C) 2010

   parents and peers as socialization agents that transmit consumption
   attitudes, goals, and motives to adolescents. We take a different
   approach, viewing parents and peers as important sources of emotional
   support and psychological well-being, which increase self-esteem in
   adolescents. Supportive parents and peers boost adolescents'
   self-esteem, which decreases their need to turn to material goods to
   develop positive self-perceptions. In a study with 12-18 year-olds, we
   find support for our view that self-esteem mediates the relationship

AB Professor Iacobucci has provided a useful introduction to the computer

   equation modeling (SEM). However, SEM has not been synonymous with
   LISREL for several decades, and focusing on LISREL's 13 Greek matrices
   and vectors is not the most intuitive way to learn SEM. It is possible
   today to do model specification via a path diagram without any need for
   filling in matrix elements. The simplest alternative is based on the
   Bentler Weeks model, whose basic concepts are reviewed. Selected
   additional SEM topics are discussed, including some recent developments
   and their practical implications. New simulation results on model fit
   under null and alternative hypotheses are also presented that are
   consistent with statistical theory but in part seem to contradict those
   reported by lacobucci. (C) 2010 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Consumers trying to watch or restrict what they eat face a battle each
   day as they attempt to navigate the food-rich environments in which they
   live. Due to the complexity of food decision making, consumers are
   susceptible to a wide range of social, cognitive, affective, and
   environmental forces determined to interrupt their intentions to
   restrict their dietary intake. In this article, we integrate literature
   from diverse theoretical perspectives into a conceptual framework
   designed to offer a better understanding of the antecedents,
   interruptions, and consequences of dietary restraint. We outline a path
   for researchers to investigate how restraint behaviors in the eating
   domain influence a wide variety of consumer psychological phenomena. It
   is our hope that a collective examination of this literature provides a
   lens that directs future research on food decision making and dietary
   restraint and empowers consumers to invest their cognitive and
   behavioral resources towards healthy eating behaviors. (C) 2010 Society

AB Three experiments investigate expertise as a moderator of the
   relationship between implicit and explicit attitude measures. Prior
   research suggests that greater expertise leads to stronger implicit
   explicit relations; however, a cognitive view of expertise can also
   predict a weaker implicit explicit relation. Our framework helps to
   resolve that seeming contradiction on the basis of the
   availability/accessibility of attributes versus attitudes in explicit
   attitude measures. We show that object specificity and contextual
   factors (e.g., instructions and prior evaluations in a survey)
   differentially affect the availability/accessibility of global attitudes
   and attribute information for novices versus experts, thus determining
   how expertise moderates the implicit explicit relation. (C) 2010 Society

   multi-item measures of communal and exchange relationship perceptions

   the way communal and exchange relationship perceptions combine to
   influence intrinsic, extrinsic, and social motivations to donate, a
   category stipulated in economics, but not in psychology. We find that
   both relationship perceptions influence consumer attitudes toward
   donating through a mix of intrinsic, extrinsic, and social motivations.

   influences consumer choices. When deciding on an option feels difficult,
   or requires effort, consumers are likely to select a different option or
   defer the decision. We find that under conditions of narrative
   processing, difficulty in processing can actually improve preferences
   because more effort leads to more transportation, or immersion, into the
   story, thus enhancing brand evaluations. Three experiments demonstrate
   that the effect of preference fluency reverses when consumers think

   research proposes that consumers with frequent (infrequent) experiences
   in a product category are primarily semantic (episodic) processors.
   Consequently, consumers with frequent experiences have an illusion of
   detail matching in retrospective self-referencing resulting from
   schema-driven memory intrusions induced by highly detailed ads.
   Alternatively, consumers with infrequent experiences exhibit intrusions
   in anticipatory self-referencing due to imagination inflation prompted
   by these ads. Two experiments demonstrate how consumer knowledge-based
   details interact with message details in retrospective and anticipatory

   models that are commonly used in business applications to model
   relationships between variables. A key strength of ANNs is their
   flexibility, i.e. their ability to easily accommodate linear and
   non-linear relationships without any a priori functional form
   specification. They can easily be used to study topics of interest to
   consumer psychologists such as persuasion, influence, segmentation etc
   and can oiler distinct advantages over traditional statistical
   techniques such as ANOVA and regression. We demonstrate the application
   of ANNs in three different areas: regression, non-linear principal

   increased activation in the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial

   aesthetic product experiences. Further, a closer look at psychometric

   involving financial products an area where financial decision-makers say
   they do not take aesthetics into account. In a series of three studies
   we find that the look of a document in hypothetical investment decisions
   impacts stock valuation and behavior in some but not all situations.
   Specifically, our results show that calling attention to the influence
   of design on behavior moderates the effect, including the paradoxical
   finding that the effect of design is attenuated when investments involve
   entities for which aesthetics is of intrinsic value. (C) 2010 Society

AB In this paper we theorize and empirically investigate how female
   consumers' attitudes and preferences relating to bodily appearance are
   linked to their perceptions of the aesthetics of fashion. Our
   theoretical work is informed by three streams of research: aesthetics of
   production, aesthetics of reception and aesthetic labor. These three
   converge to illuminate our study. Using the ZMET technique, we uncover
   four themes: fashion as wearable art, body and self-identity, bodily
   appearance and high fashion brands, and aesthetic labor through fashion.
   Our focus on the aesthetics of fashion and identity formation provides a
   segue into the broader discussion of the growing importance of
   aesthetics in understanding consumer behavior. (C) 2010 Society for

   displayed on a familiar other's regular image rather than mirror image.
   However, image format does not affect consumers' judgments when the
   other person is unfamiliar. These findings reflect differences in
   consumers' natural exposure history: we see others more often

AB In this paper, we examine aesthetic color combinations in a realistic
   product self-design task using the NIKEiD online configurator. We
   develop a similarity-based model of color relationships and empirically
   model the choice likelihoods of color pairs as a function of the
   distances between colors in the CIELAB color space. Our empirical
   analysis reveals three key findings. First, people de-emphasize
   lightness and focus on hue and saturation. Second, given this shift in
   emphasis, people generally like to combine colors that are relatively
   close or exactly match, with the exception that some people highlight
   one signature product component by using contrastive color. This result
   is more consistent with the visual coherence perspective than the
   optimal arousal perspective on aesthetic preference. Third, a small
   palette principle is supported such that the total number of colors used
   in the average design was smaller than would be expected under
   statistical independence. (C) 2010 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Although the aesthetic properties of a product have often been linked to
   consumers' emotional responses, theory and empirical evidence are yet to
   fully explain how and why aesthetic properties of a product evoke an
   emotional response. Drawing on an eclectic literature, we propose
   hypotheses connecting aesthetic principles with the subconscious
   cognitive appraisals associated with emotions. Specifically, we
   empirically test the relationships between the aesthetic principle of
   harmony and cognitive appraisals (attentional activity and
   pleasantness), while exploring the moderating role of typicality. Our
   results suggest that harmony and typicality interact to affect
   appraisals of pleasantness and attentional activity. Specifically,
   consumers tend to prefer designs that balance the levels of attentional
   resources needed and pleasantness in visually evaluating the design.
   This work advances the growing literature in product design and
   aesthetics by providing an understanding of the mechanisms through which
   aesthetic principles might prompt emotional responses in consumers. (C)

   can serve as an important source of persuasion. However, the existing
   literature seldom incorporates characteristics of consumers, such as
   self-concept, as a determining factor in the effectiveness of images'
   stylistic properties. In the context of exploring a specific stylistic
   property, camera angle, we demonstrate across three experiments that
   when an upward-looking camera angle is employed to depict a product,
   participants with an ought-self (motivated by duties and obligations)
   generate more favorable product evaluations than participants with an
   ideal-self (motivated by hopes and aspirations). The reverse is found
   when a downward-looking angle is utilized. We also explore the mechanism
   underlying these effects. That is, individuals with an ideal-self and
   ought-self use different control strategies (influencing versus adapting
   to existing realities) impacting their product evaluations. (C) 2010

   when consumers were distracted before choosing. Unconscious thinking

AB Previous research suggests that priming of behavioral concepts (e.g.,
   drinking water) motivates consumers outside conscious awareness, but
   only if primes match a current need (e.g., fluid deprivation). The
   present article reports two studies testing whether subliminal
   conditioning (subliminally priming a behavioral concept and linking it
   to positive affect) can motivate such need-related behaviors even in the
   absence of deprivation. Both studies showed an interaction effect:
   Motivation to drink water increased with fluid deprivation, and
   subliminally conditioning drinking water more positive only motivated
   drinking in the absence of deprivation. Furthermore, Study 2 suggests
   that motivation resulting from conditioning is more specific than
   following deprivation, as only the latter can be reduced by pursuing
   alternative behaviors (i.e., eating high-liquid foods). Thus, although
   traditionally the motivation for need-related behaviors is thought to
   depend on deprivation, this research shows subliminal conditioning can
   motivate consumers as if they were deprived. (C) 2010 Society for

AB The associative network model of memory proposes that each node
   (construct) belongs to specific networks of associations. These networks
   include nodes that share associations with a third (common) construct
   but are not themselves directly associated (merely associated nodes).
   The present research proposes that automatic associations between such
   indirectly related nodes can be primed in a single exposure and this may
   be sufficient to alter subsequent concept evaluations. An implicit
   cognition measure is used to demonstrate the automatic transfer of
   properties (both cognitive evaluations and affective responses) from a
   common associative node to seemingly unrelated objects. The effect is
   driven by individuals' inability to ignore activated but irrelevant
   associations. Results also show that the mere association effect and the
   underlying property transfer process (1) are more likely for consumers
   familiar with the concepts involved, (2) involve both cognitive and
   affective information, and (3) counterintuitively, occur more often for
   concepts from different categories rather than the same category. (C)

AB The relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly weak, which
   may stein in part from the way people spend it. Drawing on empirical
   research, we propose eight principles designed to help consumers get
   more happiness for their money. Specifically, we suggest that consumers
   should (1) buy more experiences and fewer material goods; (2) use their
   money to benefit others rather than themselves; (3) buy many small
   pleasures rather than fewer large ones; (4) eschew extended warranties
   and other forms of overpriced insurance; (5) delay consumption; (6)
   consider how peripheral features of their purchases may affect their
   day-to-day lives; (7) beware of comparison shopping; and (8) pay close
   attention to the happiness of others. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer

AB Why do consumers need advice on how to spend their money to improve
   their enjoyment of life? Why don't they learn this from daily
   experience? We propose that consumers' opportunity to learn from
   experience is impaired because hedonic experiences are fleeting. Once
   some time has passed, consumers rely on their general knowledge to
   reconstruct what the experience must have been, which is also the
   knowledge they use in hedonic prediction and choice. Given this overlap
   in inputs, prediction, choice and memory usually converge, leaving
   consumers with the impression that their predictions were correct and
   their choices wise. The actual in situ experience, however, may have
   been quite different. We illustrate these dynamics with a product many
   consumers want to spend their money on, namely, a luxury car. (C) 2011

AB Despite the vast public policy efforts to promote the consumption of
   healthy foods and the public's growing concern with weight management,
   the proportion of overweight individuals continues to increase. An
   important factor contributing to this obesity trend is the misguided
   belief about the relationship between a meal's healthiness and its
   impact on weight gain, whereby people erroneously believe that eating
   healthy foods in addition to unhealthy ones can decrease a meal's
   calorie count. This research documents this misperception, showing that
   it is stronger among individuals most concerned with managing their
   weight a striking result given that these individuals are more motivated
   to monitor their calorie intake. This finding has important public
   policy implications, suggesting that in addition to encouraging the
   adoption of a healthier lifestyle among overweight individuals,
   promoting the consumption of healthy foods might end up facilitating
   calorie overconsumption, leading to weight gain rather than weight loss.

   brands, one of which was subliminally primed. If neither brand was
   habitually consumed more frequently than the other, results from
   previous research were replicated. However, subliminally priming the
   more habitual brand did not increase brand choice. Remarkably, when the
   advertised brand was competing with a more habitual brand, priming
   increased choice for the primed brand at even the expense of the
   habitual choice. (C) 2010 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB The authors respond to Dunn, Gilbert, and Wilson (2011) and offer
   additional ideas about how to apply the virtue of thrift to obtain
   greater affective benefit from spending less. Materialism and
   over-consumption is damaging for the individual, the economy, and the
   environment. Over consumption is understandable in light of hedonic
   adaptation, where the happiness arising from a positive change erodes
   via two key pathways: diminishing positive emotions and rising
   aspirations. In the U.S., hedonic adaptation encourages overspending and
   indebtedness. The practice of thrift is the wise and efficient use of
   resources, and there are many thrifty proponents and adherents
   throughout history including Socrates, King Solomon, Confucius, Benjamin
   Franklin, and today, Warren Buffett. Studies suggest that individuals
   would spend less and derive more hedonic benefit by eliminating
   distressing debts, stretching positive experiences through appreciation
   and savoring, recycling positive experiences via variety and
   reminiscing, renting instead of buying, and resolutely focusing on
   intrinsic goals over extrinsic ones. With a strong financial foundation
   and the skills to make the most of positive changes, more Americans
   would be able to thrive financially and emotionally in challenging
   economic times, while contributing less to the perilous circumstances
   that led to these challenging times in the first place. (C) 2011 Society

   that consumers are more likely to spend points when they can easily
   anticipate the benefits they can enjoy with the points. Specifically,
   the decision to spend points is facilitated when it is easier to compute
   the percentage savings one can get by using the points. This
   computational ease has effects on point spending beyond that of saving
   magnitude. (C) 2010 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB This paper identifies a new bias in consumers' time perceptions
   consumers perceive a journey from a destination to home to be faster
   than a trip from home to the same destination. In three experiments we
   demonstrate that this effect occurs both for short trips and for long
   trips to and from home. We also show that this effect occurs for other
   familiar locations in addition to home. We discuss several possible
   causes for this effect and offer preliminary support for one possible
   reason that involves differences in how consumers spatially encode
   "home" vs. a destination. Since home is extremely familiar it enjoys a
   rich mental representation, and therefore, consumers may encode it as a
   relatively larger geographical area than the less familiar destination.
   We offer preliminary evidence that this can lead to a directional
   asymmetry in their feelings of trip progress. (C) 2010 Society for

   via associative processes, but not propositional processes. Experiments
   1 and 2 demonstrated that FI moderated I E relationship strength for
   attitudes formed via evaluative conditioning. High FI people had

   stronger I E correlations than those high in NC. The importance of
   considering trait variables in combination with the method of attitude

   a critical situational cue to a specific goal-directed behavior to
   bridge the intention behavior gap in consumer behavior has been limited
   by the practice of using explicit instructions to induce the construct.
   In two studies, we therefore tested the effectiveness of an indirect,
   persuasive strategy that benefits from the positive consequences of
   implementation intentions by 'mimicking' their underlying psychological
   processes. Experiment I showed that a strategy presenting vivid
   information on critical cues and appropriate behavioral responses
   affected mental imagery. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this strategy

   not affect processing. The second experiment extends RMT's applicability

   has a negative (i.e., aggravating) effect on dissatisfied consumers,
   whereas experience-based NWOM has a positive (i.e., alleviating) effect.
   Thought-listing data reveal distinct processes underlying the
   contrasting effects. On one hand, these results are consistent with the

AB Research shows that scent enhances memory for associated information.
   Current debate centers around scent's immunity to "retroactive
   interference," i.e., reduced memory for earlier-learned information
   after exposure to additional, subsequently-learned information. This
   paper demonstrates that scent-enhanced memory is indeed prone to
   retroactive interference, but that some of the information lost is
   restored using a scent-based retrieval cue. Two process explanations for
   interference effects are proposed, with the evidence providing more
   support for an inhibition rather than a response competition
   explanation. The results enhance our understanding of the encoding and
   retrieval of olfactory information from long-term memory, and reasons
   why interference occurs. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB High rates of medication non-adherence have significant public health
   and economic consequences. In other contexts such as savings behavior,
   opt-out policies, in which the alternative preferred by the policy maker
   is made the default, have gotten great traction but may not be feasible
   in health care settings. After reviewing previous applications, we
   present a series of studies, including two field experiments, that test
   the effectiveness of an alternative, 'active choice' policy in which
   there is no default, but decision makers are required to make a choice
   (Carroll, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, & Metrick, 2009; Spital, 1993, 1995).
   In addition, we propose and test a modified version of active choice,
   that we call 'enhanced active choice' that favors one alternative by
   highlighting losses incumbent in the in the non-preferred alternative.
   We recommend Enhanced Active Choice as a complement to automatic
   enrollment or when automatic enrollment is infeasible or unethical. (C)

   first making participants consider trading their endowment for an
   intermediate alternative (which shares some characteristics of the
   endowment and some characteristics of the target). We find that this
   "intermediate alternative effect" operates primarily by shifting one's
   reference point in the direction of the target alternative. Even when
   the intermediate alternative is not adopted, the extent to which one's
   endowment is treated as a reference point is weakened, which can also
   facilitate subsequent trading. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB When making purchase decisions, consumers want objective product
   specifications and seek direct product comparison. The present research
   demonstrates that consumers can make better decisions (i.e., choose what
   yields a better consumption experience) if objective specifications are
   removed and direct comparison is inhibited than if not, and this is true
   even if consumers cannot experience the target products themselves at
   the time of choice (such as in online shopping). The reason is that
   consumption is largely subjective and non-comparative, and decisions
   based on subjective and non-comparative information are often more
   compatible with consumption. In general discussion, we explore the
   boundary conditions of our findings and the implications of this
   research for a new way of marketing that emphasizes subjectivity over
   objectivity and non-comparison over comparison. (C) 2011 Society for

AB Uncertainty-seeking behavior is currently understood as the result of
   loss aversion which motivates a preference for the possibility to avoid
   or lessen an otherwise sure loss. However, when choosing among negative
   options on behalf of others, we offer responsibility aversion as another
   possible motive for uncertainty-seeking behavior. Within our conceptual
   model, responsibility aversion is defined as the preference to minimize
   one's causal role in outcome generation. Compared to certain options,
   uncertain options lessen the decision maker's causal role in outcome
   generation because the outcomes are partially determined by chance. The
   presence of chance increases indirect agency on behalf of the decision
   maker and lessens his or her perceived risk of responsibility. The
   results of five studies support a responsibility aversion motivation
   behind uncertainty-seeking behavior. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer

AB Individuals' decisions are not only influenced by their immediate
   objective and the relevance of the available information to the
   attainment of this objective. When several different cognitive
   procedures could be used to make a decision, the nature of this decision
   can depend on the procedure that happens to be used. The selection of
   this procedure, which might come into play at different stages of
   cognitive functioning, can be affected by factors that are totally
   irrelevant to the judgment or decision to be made or to the goal that is
   being pursued. In fact, procedures that have been employed in one
   situation can influence behavior in a quite different situation in the
   pursuit of a quite unrelated objective. Examples of these effects are
   reviewed and interpreted in terms of three basic principles of cognitive
   functioning that pertain to cognitive efficiency, knowledge
   accessibility and the impact of subjective experience. (C) 2010 Society

AB Much is understood about loss aversion (the tendency for losses to have
   greater hedonic impact than comparable gains), but open questions
   remain. First, there is debate about whether loss aversion is best
   understood as the byproduct of a single system within the brain that
   treats losses and gains asymmetrically or the interaction of separate
   deliberative and emotional systems. Second, some have questioned whether
   loss aversion alone is the best account for the endowment effect.
   Alternative accounts, based on the differential focus induced by buying
   versus selling, the order in which buyers and sellers consider positive
   and negative aspects of the good, the extent to which ownership induces
   liking, and the desire to avoid making a bad deal, have been proposed.
   Third, it is unclear whether losses are actually experienced more
   intensely than comparable gains, or whether people simply behave as if
   they were. Some have argued that loss aversion is nothing more than an
   affective forecasting error, while others have argued that there are
   many situations in which losses are actually more impactful than
   comparable gains. This review synthesizes the insights that behavioral
   researchers and neuroeconomists have contributed to each debate, and
   highlights potential avenues for future research. (C) 2010 Society for

   reward properties? Four studies suggest that they do. Activating needs
   for distinctiveness impacts the desirability of other, seemingly
   unrelated rewards, and reciprocally, preferences for distinctiveness are
   impacted by the presence of seemingly unrelated reward stimuli. Further,
   these cross-domain spillover effects were moderated by sensitivity to
   the general reward system and satiated by even seemingly unrelated
   intervening rewards. These findings shed light on the nature of

   integrates empirical studies and individual constructs (such as brand
   categorization, brand affect, brand personality, brand symbolism and
   brand attachment, among others) into a comprehensive framework. The
   model distinguishes three levels of consumer engagement
   (object-centered, self-centered and social) and five processes
   (identifying, experiencing, integrating, signifying and connecting).
   Pertinent psychological constructs and empirical findings are presented
   for the constructs within each process. The article concludes with
   research ideas to test the model using both standard and
   consumer-neuroscience methods. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB The application of neuroscience to marketing, and in particular to the
   consumer psychology of brands, has gained popularity over the past
   decade in the academic and the corporate world. In this paper, we
   provide an overview of the current and previous research in this area
   and explain why researchers and practitioners alike are excited about
   applying neuroscience to the consumer psychology of brands. We identify
   critical issues of past research and discuss how to address these issues
   in future research. We conclude with our vision of the future potential
   of research at the intersection of neuroscience and consumer psychology.

AB In this article, the evidence demonstrating the existence of a variety
   of robust crossmodal correspondences between both sounds (phonetic
   speech sounds, tones, and other parameters of musical expression) and
   shapes, and the sensory attributes (specifically the taste, flavor,
   aroma, and oral-somatosensory attributes) of various foods and beverages
   is reviewed. The available research now clearly suggests that marketers
   can enhance their consumers' product experiences by ensuring that the
   sound symbolism of the brand name, as well as any shape symbolism of/on
   the labeling, and even the very shape of the packaging itself, sets up
   the right (i.e., congruent) product-related sensory expectations in the
   mind of the consumer. In this review, the rapidly-growing literature on
   the topic of sound and shape symbolism is critically evaluated.
   Potential caveats, limitations, and problems of interpretation with
   previous studies are highlighted. The question of whether this approach
   to sensory marketing should be considered as implicit (or functionally
   subconscious) is also addressed. Finally, some of the relative strengths
   and weaknesses of this approach to modulating a consumer's
   product-related expectations (relative to various other approaches) are
   considered. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Consumers often need to make very rapid choices among multiple brands
   (e.g., at a supermarket shelf) that differ both in their reward value
   (e.g., taste) and in their visual properties (e.g., color and brightness
   of the packaging). Since the visual properties of stimuli are known to
   influence visual attention, and attention is known to influence choices,
   this gives rise to a potential visual saliency bias in choices. We
   utilize experimental design from visual neuroscience in three real food
   choice experiments to measure the size of the visual saliency bias and
   how it changes with decision speed and cognitive load. Our results show
   that at rapid decision speeds visual saliency influences choices more
   than preferences do, that the bias increases with cognitive load, and
   that it is particularly strong when individuals do not have strong
   preferences among the options. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB The success of a brand extension depends largely on the similarity
   between the brand and its extension product. Recent psychological and
   neuro-scientific evidence supports a dual-process model that
   distinguishes taxonomic feature-based similarity from thematic
   relation-based similarity. In addition to providing a parsimonious
   organizational framework for prior brand extension research, this
   dual-process model also provides novel predictions about the processing
   and evaluation of taxonomic brand extensions (e.g., Budweiser cola) and
   thematic brand extensions (e.g., Budweiser chips). Results indicate that
   taxonomic and thematic similarities independently contribute to branding
   professionals' and lay consumers' evaluations of real and hypothetical
   brand extensions (Studies 1A and 1B). Counter-intuitively, thematic
   brand extensions are processed more rapidly (Study 2), judged more
   novel, and evaluated more positively than taxonomic extensions (Study
   3). When induced to consider the commonalities between the brand and the
   extension product, however, taxonomic extensions are judged more novel
   and evaluated more positively (Study 3). Implications for brand
   extension and marketing more generally are discussed. (C) 2011 Society

AB We introduce a novel physiologically-based methodology to consumer
   research using the glycoprotein miraculin to manipulate the ability to
   sense and perceive specific taste elements in gustatory experiences. We
   apply this approach to exploring how information extrinsic (e.g.,
   product reviews) to a product's inherent sensory facets influences
   reported consumption experiences and experienced utility. Results from
   two experiments suggest that extrinsic information distorts the basic
   sensory and perceptual character of consumption experiences, rather than
   simply biasing self-reports of the experiences or serving as an
   independent input to overall taste and utility evaluations. Such
   evaluations are distorted in the direction of extrinsic product
   information only when the ability to actually perceive the experience as
   being consistent with the extrinsic signal is not disrupted by
   miraculin. Conversely, disruption by miraculin of the ability to
   perceive an experience as being consistent with an extrinsic signal
   ablates or reverses such effects. Implications, applications to brands
   and branding, and other possible research directions for the miraculin
   taste-manipulation methodology are also discussed. (C) 2011 Published by

   associated with positive emotions, for strong brands and activations of
   the insula, associated with negative emotions, for weak and unfamiliar
   brands suggested that consumers use experienced emotions rather than
   declarative information to evaluate brands. As a result, brand

   appearance-related desires, dollars spent, and beautification behaviors
   increased during the fertile phase. Dollars spent on products unrelated
   to food or beautification were not significantly influenced by the

   work is to use a social relationship framework to study differences in
   consumers' responses to interactional fairness as revealed by their
   evaluations of a brand. Two types of relationships are examined exchange
   relationships in which benefits are given to get something back in
   return; and communal relationships in which benefits are given to take
   care of others' needs. Results of two studies suggest that the type of
   consumers' relationship with the brand moderates the effect of
   interactional fairness such that consumers who have a communal
   relationship are more responsive to interactional fairness under
   conditions of low distributive fairness while those who have an exchange
   relationship are more responsive under conditions of high distributive
   fairness. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB In three experiments, this research provides new insights into branding
   by studying the psychological and neurophysiological mechanisms of how
   consumers relate to their beloved brands. The authors propose that
   emotional arousal decreases over the brand relationship span, while
   inclusion of the brand into the self increases over time. Results of
   experiment 1 indicate greater self-reported emotional arousal for
   recently formed brand relationships, as well as decreased emotional
   arousal and increased inclusion of close brands over time. Additionally,
   the moderating role of usage frequency of the brand brings out an
   interesting nuance of the way these effects operate. Experiment 2
   measures skin conductance responses and reveals increased emotional
   arousal for recently formed close relationships but not for established
   close brand relationships, corroborating the results based on
   self-reported data. In experiment 3, a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study reveals an association between established close
   relationships and activation of the insula, a brain area previously
   found to be a crucial mechanism in diverse but related psychological
   phenomena such as urging, addiction, loss aversion, and interpersonal

AB A core goal for marketers is effective segmentation: partitioning a
   brand's or product's consumer base into distinct and meaningful groups
   with differing needs. Traditional segmentation data include factors like
   geographic location, demographics, and shopping history. Yet, research
   into the cognitive and affective processes underlying consumption
   decisions shows that these variables can improve the matching of
   consumers with products beyond traditional demographic and benefit
   approaches. We propose, using managing a brand as an example, that
   neuroscience provides a novel way to establish mappings between
   cognitive processes and traditional marketing data. An improved
   understanding of the neural mechanisms of decision making will enhance
   the ability of marketers to effectively market their products. Just as
   neuroscience can model potential influences on the decision process
   including pricing, choice strategy, context, experience, and memory it
   can also provide new insights into individual differences in consumption
   behavior and brand preferences. We outline such a research agenda for
   incorporating neuroscience data into future attempts to match consumers

AB We use neuroimaging to predict cultural popularity something that is
   popular in the broadest sense and appeals to a large number of
   individuals. Neuroeconomic research suggests that activity in
   reward-related regions of the brain, notably the orbitofrontal cortex
   and ventral striatum, is predictive of future purchasing decisions, but
   it is unknown whether the neural signals of a small group of individuals
   are predictive of the purchasing decisions of the population at large.
   For neuroimaging to be useful as a measure of widespread popularity,
   these neural responses would have to generalize to a much larger
   population that is not the direct subject of the brain imaging itself.
   Here, we test the possibility of using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to predict the relative popularity of a common good:
   music. We used fMRI to measure the brain responses of a relatively small
   group of adolescents while listening to songs of largely unknown
   artists. As a measure of popularity, the sales of these songs were
   totaled for the three years following scanning, and brain responses were
   then correlated with these "future" earnings. Although subjective
   likability of the songs was not predictive of sales, activity within the
   ventral striatum was significantly correlated with the number of units
   sold. These results suggest that the neural responses to goods are not
   only predictive of purchase decisions for those individuals actually
   scanned, but such responses generalize to the population at large and
   may be used to predict cultural popularity. (C) 2011 Published by

   research suggests that consumers have relationships with brands that

   explore how social perception theories and processes can predict brand
   purchase interest and loyalty. Brands as Intentional Agents Framework is
   based on a well-established social perception approach: the Stereotype
   Content Model. Two studies support the Brands as Intentional Agents
   Framework prediction that consumers assess a brand's perceived
   intentions and ability and that these perceptions elicit distinct
   emotions and drive differential brand behaviors. The research shows that

   characterized in ways that resemble their relationships with people is
   gaining considerable ground in the areas of consumer behavior and
   branding. Kervyn, Fiske and Malone's "Brands as Intentional Agents"
   offers additional support for this basic proposition. The authors argue
   that the ability to translate research on human social interaction
   relationships with brand relationships provides useful insights into
   brand positioning and brand communications. This author, while raising a
   few general questions about the SCM and BIAF models, identifies

AB In two surveys of adult consumers, we find that attachment styles
   predict consumers' reactions after brand relationships end.
   Specifically, 'fearful' consumers those high in both attachment anxiety
   and avoidance are most likely to complain to third parties, to obsess
   about harming the brand, and to report seeking payback against brands.
   Two factors mediate the effect of attachment on reactions: threats to
   consumers' self-image and the loss of benefits from their relationship.
   This is consistent with the explanation we propose: specifically,
   fearful individuals invest in and depend more on consumption
   relationships and, therefore, lose more when such relationships end. (C)

   research on brand relationships and the role of perceived intentions and

   functionality in understanding the diversity of brand relationships,
   some other antecedents and consequences of brand relationships are
   reviewed. Three antecedents of corporate credibility expertise, trust,
   and likability - are suggested as another means to differentiate how
   consumers view different brands. Brand resonance an intense, active
   loyalty relationship is also suggested as an important outcome of brand
   relationships. The essay concludes by noting that any concept as complex

AB Considerable effort has been devoted towards the understanding of the
   ways in which people interact with brands. However, little attention has
   been paid to the personal differences that may impact these
   interactions. The framework for brands as intentional agents by Kervyn,
   Fiske, and Malone (this issue) is the groundbreaking application of
   almost three decades of research on warmth and competence as predictors
   of interpersonal stereotypes to the realm of brands. Our paper argues
   that demographic differences impact interactions with brands and offer
   additional explanatory power to the framework. Findings support
   conclusions of Kervyn et al., but they also suggest the importance of
   age, education, and income on warmth and competence evaluations. (C)

   Granted, Chris Malone is an experienced, senior marketing practitioner
   who now owns a research-based consulting firm with a particular interest
   and specialization in this area. In addition, Nicolas Kervyn, trained as
   an experimental social psychologist, has worked and consulted in
   marketing. Susan Fiske, trained as an experimental social psychologist,
   had kibitzed in consumer psychology since she first served on the JCP
   board as an assistant professor. However, none of us has imperialist
   ambitions in consumer psychology. We are happy nonetheless to offer our
   framework as what seems to us a potentially useful complement to prior
   and ongoing related work. These exceptionally thoughtful commentaries
   broaden and inform our framework (Kervyn, Fiske, & Malone, 2012 this
   issue). In return, we offer some responses regarding our own view of the
   Brands as Intentional Agents Framework (BIAF), its parent, the
   Stereotype Content Model (SCM), and relationships with the commentators'

AB Like most behavior, consumer behavior too is goal driven. In turn, goals
   constitute cognitive constructs that can be chronically active as well
   as primed by features of the environment. Goal systems theory outlines
   the principles that characterize the dynamics of goal pursuit and
   explores their implications for consumer behavior. In this vein, we
   discuss from a common, goal systemic, perspective a variety of well
   known phenomena in the realm of consumer behavior including brand
   loyalty, variety seeking, impulsive buying, preferences, choices and
   regret. The goal systemic perspective affords guidelines for subsequent
   research on the dynamic aspects of consummatory behavior as well as
   offering insights into practical matters in the area of marketing. (C)

AB When consumers mentally unpack (i.e., imagine) the reasons for product
   failure, their probability judgments of future product failures are
   higher than when no mental unpacking is undertaken. However, increasing
   the level of mental unpacking does not lead to monotonically increasing
   effects on probability judgments but results in inverted U-shaped
   relationships. Using a two-factor structure, we propose that when
   consumers undertake mental unpacking, there will be two conflicting
   processes; while imagining causes for an event will lead to greater
   perceived probability, the greater difficulty in generating reasons for
   an event will lead to lower perceived probability. (C) 2011 Society for

AB This paper investigates the effects of source congruence on brand
   attitudes in two situations: multiple brand endorsements by one
   celebrity and multiple celebrity endorsers of one brand. Under low
   involvement conditions, brand attitudes become more negative as a
   celebrity endorses multiple brands and more favorable with multiple
   endorsers. In high involvement conditions, strong source congruence
   overrides the negative effect of multiple brands, and the positive
   effect of multiple endorsers is found only with strong congruence. We
   interpret these results as suggestive of a frequency knowledge cue that
   dominates under low involvement but is non-diagnostic in high
   involvement scenarios. (C) 2011 Society for Consumer Psychology.

   counterintuitive effect of increasing return rates under some
   conditions. Using construal level theory, we propose that perceived
   effort (both physical and cognitive) mediates the effect of return
   policy on return rates leading to suppressed returns. Further, when
   deadlines are framed as durations between store visits, overall product
   returns are exacerbated except when perceived effort is high. Published

   the presence of sales. Study 2 demonstrates that both age groups favor
   conceptually easier promotions, even when the sale is inferior.
   Additionally, we find that children have difficulty applying
   mathematical concepts to sales promotions, regardless of classroom
   mastery of the associated operations. Together, these results indicate
   that elementary-aged children routinely incorporate sales into purchase
   decisions, sometimes with suboptimal results. (C) 2011 Society for

AB We argue that consumers with high self-brand connections (SBC) respond
   to negative brand information as they do to personal failure - they
   experience a threat to their positive self-view. After viewing negative
   brand information, high (vs. low) SBC consumers reported lower state
   self-esteem. Consumers with high SBC also maintained favorable brand
   evaluations despite negative brand information. However, when they
   completed an unrelated self-affirmation task, they lowered their brand
   evaluations the same as low SBC consumers. This finding suggests that
   high SBC consumers' reluctance to lower brand evaluation might be driven
   by a motivation to protect the self rather than the brand. (C) 2011

AB Most research on consumer choice assumes that decisions are usually made
   by individuals, and that these decisions are based on an individual's
   personal attitudes, beliefs, and preferences. Yet, much consumer
   behavior from joint decisions to individual choices is directly or
   indirectly shaped by people with whom we have some relationship. In this
   target article, we examine how each member in a relationship can affect
   how consumer decisions are made. After reviewing foundational work in
   the area, we introduce a powerful and statistically sophisticated
   methodology to study decisions within relationships-a dyadic framework
   of decision-making. We then discuss how the study of consumer decisions
   in relationships can be informed by different theories in the
   relationships field, including attachment, interdependence, social
   power, communal/exchange orientations, relationship norms, and
   evolutionary principles. By building on the seminal foundations of prior
   joint-decision making research with theories and methods from
   contemporary relationship science, we hope to facilitate the integration
   of the consumer and relationships literature to better understand and
   generate novel hypotheses about consumer decisions in relationships. (C)

AB I define "sensory marketing" as "marketing that engages the consumers'
   senses and affects their perception, judgment and behavior." From a
   managerial perspective, sensory marketing can be used to create
   subconscious triggers that characterize consumer perceptions of abstract
   notions of the product (e.g., its sophistication or quality). Given the
   gamut of explicit marketing appeals made to consumers every day,
   subconscious triggers which appeal to the basic senses may be a more
   efficient way to engage consumers. Also, these sensory triggers may
   result in consumers' self-generation of (desirable) brand attributes,
   rather than those verbally provided by the advertiser. The understanding
   of these sensory triggers implies an understanding of sensation and
   perception as it applies to consumer behavior-this is the research
   perspective of sensory marketing. This review article presents an
   overview of research on sensory perception. The review also points out
   areas where little research has been done, so that each additional paper
   has a greater chance of making a bigger difference and sparking further
   research. It is quite apparent from the review that there still remains
   tremendous need for research within the domain of sensory
   marketing-research that can be very impactful. (C) 2011 Society for

AB Most choice research has studied how people make decisions within a
   narrowly defined choice context and has not paid sufficient attention to
   the role of social context. We commend Simpson, Griskevicius, and
   Rothman for directing the attention of choice researchers to the study
   of joint decision making and current theories on relationships. Building
   on SGR, we propose that a relationship partner's influence varies with
   the type of decision at hand and with situational factors. We propose
   four possible types of decision episodes, defined by whether the
   decision stage and the consumption stage each occur singly or jointly,
   and explore how the decision type impacts the extent to which a decision
   maker will take a partner's preferences into account. We further discuss
   how situational factors, such as the environment in which the decision
   is made, as well as the mindset and cognitive resources of the decision
   maker, are likely to influence decision outcomes. (C) 2012 Society for

AB A series of experiments demonstrates that consumers exhibit aversion to
   waste during forward-looking purchase. These experiments further reveal
   that such behavior is driven by distaste for unused utility, a reaction
   that is shown to be distinct from an aversion to squandering money.
   Waste aversion is especially pronounced when consumers anticipate future
   consequences and deprivation is salient. In addition to demonstrating
   robustness across consumers and marketing contexts, the results also
   demonstrate how waste aversion can lead to self-defeating behavior in
   which consumers forego desired utility. Finally, the present research
   demonstrates and discusses the implications of waste aversion for a
   variety of marketing issues, including buy-rent markets, bundling, and
   the fundamental distinction between goods and services. (C) 2011 Society

   depending upon price uncertainty. Perceived benevolence and purchase

AB Numbers and prices can be processed and encoded in three different
   forms: 1) visual [based on their written form in Arabic numerals (e.g.,
   72)], 2) verbal [based on spoken word-sounds (e.g., "seventy" and
   "two"), and 3) analog (based on judgments of relative "size" or amount
   (e.g., more than 70 but less than 80)1 In this paper, we demonstrate
   that including commas (e.g., $1599 vs. $1599) and cents (e.g., $1599.85
   vs. $1599) in a price's Arabic written form (i.e., how it is perceived
   visually) can change how the price is encoded and represented verbally
   in a consumer's memory. In turn, the verbal encoding of a written price
   can influence assessments of the numerical magnitude of the price. These
   effects occur because consumers non-consciously perceive that there is a
   positive relationship between syllabic length and numerical magnitude.
   Three experiments are presented demonstrating this important effect. (C)

AB How can firms use brand personalities to develop the most persuasive

   that capitalize on the signaling opportunities that using these brands
   can provide (signaling ad appeal) versus the self-improvement
   opportunities that using these brands can offer (self-improvement ad
   appeal). In two studies, we find that the effectiveness of these appeals
   depends on consumers' implicit self-theories. Specifically, signaling ad
   appeals are more effective for consumers who believe their personal
   qualities are fixed and cannot be developed through their own efforts
   (entity theorists), whereas self-improvement ad appeals are more
   effective for consumers who believe their personal qualities are
   malleable and can be developed (incremental theorists). Implications for

   objects associated with status. Experiment 1 found that individuals who
   belonged to and identified with a status social category associated with
   relatively lower status (Blacks) exhibited an enhanced desire for
   high-status products compared to Blacks who did not identify with their
   race or individuals who belonged to a social category associated with
   higher status (Whites). In Experiments 2 and 3, White participants led
   to vicariously identify through perspective taking with Blacks
   (Experiment 2), or a low-status occupational group (Experiment 3)
   exhibited an increased desire for high-status products. Experiment 4
   provided meditational evidence for a status based explanation for the
   relationship between identification with a low-status group and a desire
   for high-status products. The present work makes new inroads into
   understanding one factor that might lead minorities to engage in greater
   conspicuous consumption and provides evidence that conspicuous
   consumption can be elicited vicariously. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

AB Surprisingly little research examines whether and how category
   advertising norms influence the effectiveness of comparative
   advertising. To address this void, the present research investigates if
   the persuasiveness of a particular comparative advertisement depends on
   whether or not it is viewed as a typical tactic that conforms to
   category advertising norms. Results from experiments 1 and 2 indicate
   that a comparative advertisement used in violation of category norms
   results in a persuasion penalty that is evidenced by a reduction in the
   ad's impact on brand attitudes. This effect of category norms on
   persuasion is shown to be mediated by evaluations of the comparative
   advertisement's appropriateness in the product category. A final
   experiment confirms this persuasion penalty with respect to consumers
   holding conformity-based motives. However, this penalty is found to be
   reversed for individuals seeking counter-conformity in the marketplace,
   who respond more favorably to a comparative advertisement when it
   violates rather than conforms to category norms. (c) 2012 Society for

AB People tend to like experiences less the more they repeat them, a
   process commonly referred to as satiation. Despite an increasing
   interest in satiation among consumer researchers, we still know very
   little about the role that emotions play in the process. Through a
   series of three experiments, we show paradoxically that when individuals
   differentiate between the positive and negative emotions that arise
   during repeated consumption, they satiate at a slower rate. We show that
   a cognitive re-appraisal process drives this emotional differentiation
   effect, whereby, when individuals focus on negative emotions they
   exhibit increased enjoyment of repeated consumption sequences. We
   demonstrate these effects for both trait and state emotional
   differentiation and across both continued and repeated consumption
   contexts. Theoretical implications of these findings for satiation,
   emotional differentiation, and emotion regulation literatures are then
   discussed. (c) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Extant research suggests that when marketers introduce products with
   functions that span multiple categories, consumers tend to generate
   beliefs in line with only a single category. This has been regarded as a
   major marketing challenge because it leads consumers to ignore key
   attributes from the product's supplementary category. Contrary to this
   prediction, the authors find that because consumers tend to classify new
   hybrid products by contrasting them against the competitive context,
   attributes from the supplementary category become more salient and thus
   contribute greater utility in choice. The authors pit the strength of
   this effect against several of the most dominant and favored category
   cues. The results confirm that classification inferences and attribute
   preference for new hybrid products are highly contextual, and as such,
   single category inferences need not translate directly into attribute
   preference. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Vanity sizing, the practice of clothing manufacturers, whereby smaller
   size labels are used on clothes than what the clothes actually are, has
   become very common. Apparently, it helps sell clothes-women prefer small
   size clothing labels to large ones. We propose and demonstrate that
   smaller size labels evoke more positive self-related mental imagery.
   Thus, consumers imagine themselves more positively (thinner) with a
   vanity sized size-6 pant versus a size-8 pant. We also show that
   appearance self-esteem moderates the (mediating) effect of imagery on
   vanity sizing effectiveness-while vanity sizing evokes more positive
   mental imagery for both low and high appearance self-esteem individuals,
   the effect of the positive imagery on clothing preference is significant
   (only) for people with low appearance self-esteem, supported by the
   theory of compensatory self-enhancement.
   Our suggestion of simple marketing communications affecting valence of
   imagery and consequent product evaluation have implications for many
   other marketing domains. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Recent research suggests that unconscious thought is superior to
   conscious thought in many cognitive domains. In this article, we show
   that the duration of unconscious thought has an inverted-U shaped
   relationship with creativity performance. Unconscious thought is, thus,
   unlikely to provide creative advantage over conscious thought when
   deliberation duration is either short or long. However, when
   deliberation duration is of a moderate length, the creative output of
   unconscious thought surpasses that of conscious thought. Furthermore,
   the superiority of unconscious thought pertains only to the novelty
   dimension of creativity, but not the appropriateness dimension. These
   findings not only shed light on the powers and limits of unconscious
   thought but also illuminate the importance of calibration in utilizing
   unconscious thought to boost creativity. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

   otherwise. These undesirable consumption effects of sadness can occur
   without awareness, thus representing more than just conscious attempts
   at "retail therapy." In an experiment with real food consumption, the
   present paper examines the hypothesis that sadness' impact on
   consumption could be attenuated if the choice context counteracted
   appraisals of helplessness and enhanced a sense of individual control.
   Results revealed that: (1) sadness elevates self-reports of helplessness
   in response to the emotion-inducing situation, (2) helplessness mediates
   the sadness consumption effect, and (3) inducing a sense of control (via
   choice) attenuates sadness' effect. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

AB Previous research found that positive fantasies about an idealized
   future yield low energy to pursue the fantasized future. We examined how
   positive fantasies about the resolution of a crisis (i.e., a lack of
   pain medication in Sierra Leone, the risk of flooding after Hurricane
   Irene) influence people's agreement to donate to charitable efforts
   directed at crisis resolution. In three studies, positive fantasies
   dampened the likelihood of agreeing to donate a relatively large amount
   of money, effort, or time, but did not affect the likelihood of agreeing
   to donate a relatively small amount of these resources. The effect of
   positive fantasies was mediated by perceiving the donation of larger
   (but not smaller) amounts of resources as overly demanding. These
   findings suggest that charitable solicitations requesting small
   donations might benefit from stimulating positive fantasies in potential
   donors, but those requesting large donations could be hurt. (C) 2012

   expectations (a male conductor played male-typed music), pre-trial
   source information had the same effect on post-trial product judgments
   as when source information was absent. Incongruence (a female conductor
   played male-typed music) distorted product attribute judgments when the
   source's competence was questioned. Her music was judged to be more
   delicate, less powerful and worse quality than his. This process of
   product experience being assimilated into incompetence stereotypes
   required minimal cognitive resources. When the incongruent source was
   undoubtedly competent, the amount of experiential evidence about an
   attribute influenced distortion. Consumers judged powerful music as
   powerful regardless of conductor gender, but, lacking much evidence
   about its delicacy, judged hers as more delicate than his. The selective

AB Accessibility experiences have been a subject of interest since Tversky
   and Kahneman (1973) published their account of the availability
   heuristic-specifically, individuals often utilize the phenomenological
   experience of ease or difficulty of recall in constructing a judgment
   (Schwarz, 1998). The reported studies contribute further to work in this
   area by examining the moderating role of knowledge on accessibility
   experiences and their use in evaluative judgments. We argue that
   knowledgeable individuals are more likely to experience interference
   effects in early stages of recall. This would result in a reversal of
   the usual phenomenon such that while low knowledge individuals would
   find recalling larger sets effortful, which would lead them to form more
   negative evaluations when recalling larger amounts of information, high
   knowledge individuals would find recalling smaller sets effortful and
   would form more negative evaluations when recalling smaller amounts of
   information. We discuss potential explanations and draw attention to the
   distinction between generating a response and the appropriateness of the
   response in accessibility experiences. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

   processing by exposing dieters and nondieters to either cost or pleasure
   information about chocolate. The results of experiments 1-3 show that
   when dieters have the ability to monitor the costs of consumption, they
   are motivated to mobilize additional strength and increase their ability
   to self-regulate. In experiment 4 we show the practical implications of

AB Consumers often behave optimistically, purchasing products that they are
   unable to use at the time of purchase, but anticipate being able to use
   in the future. This research investigates such anticipatory purchase
   behavior, and demonstrates that optimism exerts its influence on
   anticipatory purchase via two distinct routes. One is driven by the
   perceived ease of the process required to achieve a given outcome and
   prevails when sufficient cognitive resources are available, while the
   other is driven directly by the perceived favorability of the outcome
   itself and holds when cognitive resources are constrained. Within each
   route, the focus of thought (process vs. outcome-focus) moderates the
   influence of optimism, and the two routes converge on enhanced
   motivation. Multiple experiments provide support for predictions derived
   from this framework, illuminating the substantive domain of anticipatory
   purchasing and providing theoretical insights into the nature of
   optimism. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

   discrepancy between intentions and behavior is likely to disappear. Two
   studies provide support for this basic contention, implicating the

   increased resource usage compared to when a recycling option is not

   consumers used more paper while evaluating a pair of scissors when the
   option to recycle was provided (vs. not provided). In a follow-up field

AB Simonson et al. (forthcoming) propose a new theory of comparison
   selection that explains which particular alternatives will be considered
   in a wide variety of judgment and choice tasks. Comparison selection
   depends on the latitude of acceptance, comparison fluency, and the
   interaction between these factors. Importantly, these factors integrate
   a wide variety of seemingly unrelated variables, and the theory is
   useful for generating novel hypotheses. However, because comparative
   processing occurs relatively infrequently, it is important to take a
   step back and specify the conditions under which comparative processing
   is likely to occur. Comparative processing is likely only when the
   motivation and the opportunity to process information carefully are
   high, when consumers lack knowledge about distributional standards, or
   when stimulus-based judgment is likely. The two types of processes have
   different antecedents, consequences, and implications for debiasing. (C)

AB Simonson et al. present an ambitious sketch of an integrative theory of
   context. Provoked by this thoughtful proposal, I discuss what is the
   function of theories of choice in the coming decades. Traditionally,
   choice models and theory have attempted to predict choices as a function
   of the attributes of options. I argue that to be truly useful, they need
   to generate specific and quantitative predictions of the effect of the
   choice environment upon choice probability. To do this, we need to focus
   on rigorously modeling and measuring the underlying processes causing
   these effects, and use the Simonson et al. proposal to provide some
   examples. I also present some examples from research in decision-making
   and decision neuroscience, and argue that models that fail, and fail
   spectacularly are particularly useful. I close with a challenge: How
   would consumer researcher aid the design of real world choice
   environments such as the health exchanges under the Patient Protection
   and Affordable Care Act? (C) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB We introduce an alternative perspective on the study of consumer
   judgment and decision making, which is based on the notion that judgment
   and choice problems consist of comparisons that decision makers might
   select. Our new perspective proposes that if we can predict the
   likelihood that particular comparisons will become focal in a judgment
   or choice task, we will be able to gain a better understanding of and
   anticipate the resulting effect. Building on related literatures, we
   propose that comparison selection is driven by the task's latitude of
   acceptance (LOA) and comparison fluency (i.e., the overall ease of
   making that comparison). The task's LOA curve represents the range and
   concentration of potentially acceptable comparisons, whereas comparison
   fluency refers to the salience and ease of making the comparison. We
   illustrate our approach using previously studied problems (e.g., choice,
   variety seeking, the "jacket and calculator" problem, and contingent
   valuation) as well as new empirical tests. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

AB Past research has shown repeatedly that people prefer donating to a
   single identified human victim rather than to unidentified or abstract
   donation targets. In the current research we show results countering the
   identifiable victim effect, wherein people prefer to donate to
   charitable organizations rather than to an identifiable victim. In a
   series of five studies, we manipulate temporal and social distance,
   examine a variety of donation targets, and measure intention to donate
   time or money as well as actual donations of money. We show that people
   are more willing to donate to a charitable organization when they are
   temporally or socially distant from the population in need. Willingness
   to donate to a specific person in need is higher when donors are
   temporally or socially close to the donation target. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that (a) empathy mediates donations to a single victim, yet
   does not mediate donations to charitable organizations; (b) that
   donation giving to charitable organizations is unique and is not similar
   to donations to a group of victims. Theoretical and practical
   implications are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by

AB Alcohol consumption and cognitive impairment frequently co-occur. We
   propose that the relationship is so familiar that exposure to alcohol
   cues primes expectations of cognitive impairment. Across five studies,
   we find that in the absence of any evidence of reduced cognitive
   performance, people who hold an alcoholic beverage are perceived to be
   less intelligent than those who do not, a mistake we term the imbibing
   idiot bias. In fact, merely priming observers with alcohol cues causes
   them to judge targets who hold no beverage at all as less intelligent.
   The bias is not driven by a belief that less intelligent people are more
   likely to consume alcohol. We find that the bias may be costly in
   professional settings. Job candidates who ordered wine during an
   interview held over dinner were viewed as less intelligent and less
   hireable than candidates who ordered soda. However, prospective
   candidates believe that ordering wine rather than soda will help them
   appear more intelligent. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB This research examines whether recommendation signage helps or hinders
   the consumer when faced with choosing from large product assortments. In
   spite of frequent usage and retailer intuition suggesting that providing
   recommendation signs (e.g., "Best Seller," "Award Winner") should help
   consumers in the choice process, we propose that signs can hinder choice
   for consumers with more developed preferences by adding to the
   complexity and difficulty of the decision process. In three experiments
   using horizontally differentiated products in multiple categories, we
   provide evidence that recommendation signs create preference conflict
   for consumers with more developed preferences, leading these consumers
   to form larger consideration sets and ultimately experience more
   difficulty from the decision-making process. In addition, we show that
   these effects are mitigated for consumers with less developed
   preferences and when the choice is from a small assortment. The results
   suggest that recommendation signage may not be an effective tool for
   aiding choice from large assortments; instead signage can exacerbate the
   difficulties associated with having too many choices, with implications
   on purchase quantity. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Studies of social judgment found that the way bicultural individuals
   respond to cultural cues depends on their cultural identity structure.
   Biculturals differ in the degree to which they represent their two
   cultural identities as integrated (vs. nonintegrated), which is assessed
   as high (vs. low) bicultural identity integration (BII), respectively.
   High BII individuals assimilate to cultural cues, yet low BII
   individuals contrast to these cues. The current studies reveal that this
   dynamic extends to consumer behavior and elucidate the underlying
   psychological mechanism. We found that high (low) BII individuals
   exhibit assimilation (contrast) responses to cultural cues in consumer
   information-seeking and choice. Furthermore, the pattern occurs with
   both subliminal (study 1) and supraliminal (study 2) cultural primes,
   and is mediated by the experience of identity exclusion threat (study
   2). Results suggest that the interactive effect of BII and cultural cues
   arises from nonconscious defense against the exclusion of a cultural
   identity. Implications for self-protective processes, automatic
   behavior, and marketing are discussed. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

   if they own them, a finding commonly known as the endowment effect. In
   fact, simply touching an object can create a perception of ownership
   that produces the endowment effect. In this paper, we extend this line
   of research in several ways. First, we show that haptic imagery, or
   imagining touching an object, can have the same effect on perceived
   ownership as physical touch. We then demonstrate that haptic imagery can
   lead to perceptions of physical control, which in turn increase feelings
   of ownership. Moreover, the more vivid the haptic imagery, the greater
   the perception of control and the feeling of ownership. Implications for
   theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

   perceived duration of the task compared to counting upward. People
   perceive that less time has elapsed when they were counting downward
   versus upward while using a product (Studies I and 3) or watching
   geometrical shapes (Study 2). The counting direction effect is obtained
   using both prospective and retrospective time judgments (Study 3), but
   only when the count range begins with the number "1" (Study 2).
   Furthermore, the counting direction affects peoples' attitude toward the
   product, their likelihood of using it again, and their purchase
   intentions. We test several plausible accounts for the counting
   direction effect, including task difficulty, numerical anchoring, and
   arousal. We find preliminary evidence that downward counting feels
   shorter because it is more arousing than upward counting. (C) 2012

AB This article investigates if and how the valence of color cues affects
   moral acceptability of (un)desirable consumer behaviors. Study 1 uses
   colors with definite differences in terms of valence, namely, red and
   green. Study 2 applies an evaluative conditioning paradigm to endow
   initially neutral colors with negative versus positive valences. We find
   an ironic color effect: undesirable behaviors become more acceptable
   when presented with negatively valenced colors. In general, respondents
   find (un)desirable behaviors more acceptable when a background color is
   of the same valence rather than neutral or opposite in valence.
   Implications for promotion and prevention campaigns are discussed. (C)

   to the target papers by Saad (this issue) and by Griskevicius and

   debate about evolutionary psychology [EP] among biologists and
   behavioral ecologists. The two main areas of disagreement are over (1)
   the role of genetic adaptations resulting from natural selection in
   ancient times compared to other forces leading to current behavior; and
   (2) the likelihood that evolution resulted in a set of highly
   specialized mental modules or information-processing circuits thought to
   be instrumental in determining present-day behavior. We review the EP
   research discussed by the authors of the target papers as a means of
   evaluating the evidence in support of the theory and of suggesting

AB What do material goods intended for personal consumption mean to
   community? We use the extreme example of natural disaster recovery in a
   community to explore this question. Our work describes how members make
   sense of material objects that transition from private to public
   possessions (damaged goods) and public to private possessions (donated
   goods). By blending consumer and community psychology perspectives with
   our narratives, we employ a three-dimensional framework for analyzing
   object meanings: (I) material objects as agents of communitas (a shared
   sense of "we"), (2) material objects as agents of individualism (a focus
   on "me"), and (3) material objects as agents of opposition (the "we"
   that speaks for "me" and "us" versus "them"). This theoretical frame
   allows us to show how different conceptions of identity lead to
   conflicting meanings of objects within community, and to explain how and
   why object meanings shift as objects move across time and space from
   private to public and from scarcity to abundance. We also provide
   implications for coping with disasters that consider collective and
   individual identities as well as oppositional stances in between. (C)

   psychological processes that underlie whether and how corporate
   sponsorship impacts an individual's willingness to support nonprofit
   organizations and suggests that unintended negative outcomes may emerge.
   Specifically, results from five studies suggest that exposure to
   sponsorship information can reduce prospective donors' willingness to
   support a nonprofit because people believe that their individual
   contributions will matter less. In addition, this research identifies a
   potential mechanism (i.e., donor-company identification) that can

AB Regulatory fit influences the effectiveness of persuasion through two
   paths: 1) a "feeling right" as "feeling good about the target" effect
   where feeling right is a positive feeling that transfers positivity
   directly to the target, similar to "feelings as information" or fluency
   effects, and 2) a "feeling right" as "feeling confident about the
   evaluation" effect where feeling right is feeling confident about one's
   evaluative judgments of the target that increases reliance on those
   evaluations. We propose that the involvement with an attitude-related
   issue in a persuasion message is one key factor that determines when
   each effect will occur. Five studies demonstrate that under high
   involvement, fit increased reliance on evaluative reactions to the
   target, making a target of a positive advocacy message evaluated as more
   positive and a target of a negative advocacy message evaluated as more
   negative; and under low involvement, fit increased the positivity of
   feelings toward the target regardless of the valence of the message
   advocacy, making the evaluation of the target more positive for either a
   positive or negative advocacy message. (C) 2012 Society for Consumer

AB Many important decisions that consumers face involve choosing between
   options that are unattractive or undesirable the proverbial "lesser of
   two evils." Consumers, who face budget or geographical constraints, for
   example, end up with mostly undesirable consideration sets; yet a choice
   is necessary. We examine the role of option set desirability in the
   context of the well-established attraction effect. In five studies, we
   show that the attraction effect occurs in desirable domains but is
   eliminated when all the options are undesirable (Experiments 1-4). We
   further find that this asymmetric effect is consistent with a shift in
   decision makers' processing styles. Decision makers show more vigilant
   processing when making choices among undesirable (vs. desirable) domains
   (Experiments 3A and 3B), which results in an attenuated attraction
   effect (Experiment 4). Our results indicate that the attraction effect
   might not be as robust as generally thought and establishes
   (un)desirability as an important boundary condition. (C) 2012 Society

   ultimate and proximate scientific explanations. The evolutionary bases
   of memory, attitude formation/change, emotions, perception (our five
   senses), personality, and decision making are addressed next, along with
   specific links to consumer research. Next, I demonstrate how numerous
   consumer acts could be classified into one of four basal Darwinian
   modules: survival, reproduction (mating), kin selection, and reciprocal
   altruism. The paper continues with an exploration of the evolutionary
   roots of cultural products (e.g., song lyrics) and Darwinian happiness
   (along with the evolutionary etiology of maladaptive phenomena such as
   pathological gambling and compulsive buying). I conclude with a
   discussion of key epistemological benefits of Darwinizing consumer
   research including greater consiliencc, increased interdisciplinarity,
   and an ethos of methodological pluralism. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer

AB Can we better understand modem consumer behavior by examining its links
   to our ancestral past? We consider the underlying motives for
   consumption and choice from an evolutionary perspective. We review
   evidence that deep-seated evolutionary motives continue to influence
   much modem behavior, albeit not always in obvious or conscious ways.
   These fundamental motives include: (1) evading physical harm, (2)
   avoiding disease, (3) making friends, (4) attaining status, (5)
   acquiring a mate, (6) keeping a mate, and (7) caring for family. We
   discuss how, why, and when these motives influence behavior,
   highlighting that many consumer choices ultimately function to help
   fulfill one or more of these evolutionary needs. An important
   implication of this framework is that a person's preferences, behaviors,
   and decision processes change in predictable ways depending on which
   fundamental motive is currently active. We discuss how consideration of
   evolutionary motives provides fertile ground for future consumer
   research, while also helping build bridges between consumer behavior,
   evolutionary biology, and other social sciences. (C) 2013 Society for

   perspective is based on a multidisciplinary nomological network of
   evidence, and results of particular experiments are only one part of
   that network. The precise nature of, and number of, information
   processing systems, is an empirical question. Consumer psychologists
   need not retrain as biologists to profit from using insights and

AB Consumer psychology faces serious issues of internal and external
   relevance. Most of these issues originate in seven fundamental problems
   with the way consumer psychologists plan and conduct their research
   problems that could be called "the seven sins of consumer psychology."
   These seven "sins" are (1) a narrow conception of the scope of consumer
   behavior research; (2) adoption of a narrow set of theoretical lenses;
   (3) adherence to a narrow epistemology of consumer research; (4) an
   almost exclusive emphasis on psychological processes as opposed to
   psychological content; (5) a strong tendency to overgeneralize from
   finite empirical results, both as authors and as reviewers; (6) a
   predisposition to design studies based on methodological convenience
   rather than on substantive considerations; and (7) a pervasive confusion
   between "theories of studies" and studies of theories. Addressing these
   problems ("atoning for these sins") would greatly enhance the relevance
   of the field. However, this may require a substantial rebalancing of the
   field's incentives to reward actual research impact rather than sheer
   number of publications in major journals. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer

AB While sponsorship disclosure is proposed as a remedy for covert
   marketing, i.e., tactics such that the persuasive nature of the
   communication is not clear to consumers, little is known about whether
   or when disclosures prompt consumers to correct for persuasion. Three
   experiments reveal that covert marketing, in the form of subtle product
   placements, can increase brand recall and attitudes but that both
   instructions to avoid influence and mere disclosure of sponsorship can
   lead to correction. The first experiment demonstrates that consumers are
   able to correct both brand attitudes and stated recall when there are
   instructions to avoid influence. The following two experiments show that
   mere sponsorship disclosure can evoke use of persuasion knowledge for
   correction. However, disclosure timing differentially influences
   correction for recall and attitudes. Disclosure prior to exposure to the
   covert marketing tactic leads only to correction for effects on recall;
   attitude is as high with a prior disclosure as with placement with no
   disclosure. Disclosure after placement provides general correction of
   the impact of the covert marketing tactic on both recall and attitudes.

AB We are highly sympathetic to Dhar and Gorlin's goal of developing a dual
   system theory of choice. But we do feel that the proposal could be
   changed and clarified in a few ways. Specifically, we believe that the
   evidence suggests that the systems operate in parallel, not
   sequentially. In addition, the relation between intuitive/associative
   processing and affect remains unresolved, a vagueness that is especially
   troublesome for the problem of choice. Relatedly, the description of
   System I as perceptual requires further explanation and refinement.
   Finally, we reconsider the attribution of the compromise effect to
   deliberative processing and propose an alternative explanation, one that
   reveals one aspect of the interaction between intuitive and deliberative
   processes. While further specification and testing of predictions are
   necessary, the proposal by Dhar and Gorlin makes a substantive
   contribution toward understanding how choices are made. (C) 2013 Society

   orientations better and prefer products for which the handle is oriented
   in the direction of the hand used for grasping. When their ability to

AB This paper extends prior research on consumer knowledge beliefs and
   word-of-mouth transmission. Findings from four studies suggest that
   people compensate for unfavorable discrepancies between their actual and
   ideal consumer knowledge with heightened efforts to signal
   knowledgeability through the content and volume of their word-of-mouth
   transmissions. This compensatory knowledge signaling effect is moderated
   by the self-concept relevance (psychological closeness) of the
   word-of-mouth target and lay beliefs in the self-enhancement benefits of
   transmitting product knowledge. Content analysis of participants'
   product communications further supports our knowledge signaling account.
   The relationship between actual:ideal knowledge discrepancies and
   heightened word-of-mouth intentions is mediated by the specific negative
   emotion associated with actual:ideal self-discrepancies. Overall, the
   findings suggest that the relationship between consumer knowledge and
   word-of-mouth transmission depends not only on what you think you know,
   but also on what you wish you knew. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer

AB This research presents a new scale, the health regulatory focus scale,
   which measures an individual's tendency to use promotion or prevention
   strategies in the pursuit of health goals. We conducted five studies in
   France to develop the scale which is made up of two subscales for
   prevention and promotion. We also tested the scale's psychometric
   properties and demonstrated its two-factor dimensionality, internal and
   test-retest reliability, and convergent, nomological, predictive and
   discriminant validity. The health subscales showed good predictive
   validity in that they correlated with health behaviors better than the
   general regulatory focus subscales. For instance, health promotion focus
   predicted dentist visits while general promotion focus did not, and
   health prevention focus predicted the use of prescription and
   over-the-counter drugs while general prevention focus did not. Also as
   expected, general prevention focus predicted avoidance of risky vacation
   behaviors while health prevention focus did not. The health subscales
   either did not correlate or correlated weakly with positive and negative
   affectivity and general risk aversion indicating good discriminant
   validity. The one-year test-retest reliabilities were adequate for both
   subscales. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB We propose that women's increased generalized sensitivity to rewards
   during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle causes them to seek more
   variety in rewards when they are in the fertile phase than when they are
   not in the fertile phase of the cycle. In Studies 1-3, across the reward
   domains of mating and hedonic food, we show that women seek more variety
   in rewards when closer to ovulation. Moreover, we provide support for
   the proposition that women's increased reward sensitivity during the
   fertile phase of the menstrual cycle causes their greater variety
   seeking. Specifically, in Study 3, we show that fertile women's greater
   variety seeking does not extend to non-rewards, such as non-hedonic
   food. Our findings suggest that behavioral effects of women's hormonal
   shifts during the menstrual cycle are not limited to the mating domain
   and may extend to a wide category of reward domains. (C) 2013 Society

   role (as a friend or as a leader), whether the physical position of a
   brand image in relation to the customer's image influences brand
   evaluations. Two studies reveal that the match between the promoted
   social role and the visual representations of the brand and customer in
   the ad layout improves evaluations. When the brand is promoted as a
   friend to its customers, consumers evaluate it more positively if the
   image of the brand is located horizontally and near to the image of the
   customer. However, when the "brand is promoted as a leader to its
   customers, consumers evaluate it more positively if the image of the
   brand is located above and far from the image of the customer. (C) 2013

AB In one laboratory study and one field study conducted with a large,
   representative sample of respondents, we show that seemingly innocuous
   questions that precede a conjoint task, such as demographic and
   usage-related screening questions can alter the price sensitivities
   recovered from the main conjoint task. The findings demonstrate that
   whether these prior questions use broad response categories (i.e., few
   scale points) or narrow response categories (i.e., many scale points)
   systematically influences consumers' price sensitivity in a CBC (Choice
   Based Conjoint) study. We suggest that this may occur because the narrow
   (vs. broad) response categories in the prior questions lead to
   consideration of a greater (vs. fewer) number of attributes during the
   key conjoint task. Since both groups of consumers readily consider the
   naturally salient price attribute, responding to previous questions with
   narrow (vs. broad) response categories leads to a greater (vs. fewer)
   number of non-price attributes being considered, and consequently,
   decrease the weight afforded to price and reduce price sensitivity. (C)

AB Building on the dual-system theory of judgment, we propose an intuitive
   and deliberate framework for understanding the effects of preference
   construction in choice. We argue that while certain choice effects can
   be attributed primarily to rapid, unintentional, and intuitive
   processing, others arise from intentional and deliberate processing. We
   use this distinction to group choice effects previously identified in
   the literature, discuss evidence in support of the dual-system framework
   of preference construction, and propose new research directions. Since
   the defining property of intuitive versus deliberate mental processes is
   the degree to which they engage working memory, the proposed framework
   sheds light on how these previously identified effects will change with
   conditions such as the availability of cognitive resources. We conclude
   by calling for additional research to explore the interplay between
   intuitive and deliberate processing to determine which processes are
   implicated in generating a preference, as well as research on new
   moderators of choice effects based on the difference in the amount of
   willful information processing that underlies decision making. (C) 2013

AB Dhar and Gorlin (2013) proposed a dual-process perspective on choice. We
   applaud the effort to generate such a model, and we support the effort
   to integrate potentially disparate literatures under a general
   theoretical approach. In an attempt to further that goal of integration,
   we discuss similarities and differences between the proposed approach
   and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty, 1977; Petty & Cacioppo,
   1979, 1986) - one of the earliest models of evaluative judgment to
   propose different mechanisms and consequences of judgments formulated at
   different levels of motivation and ability to process available
   information. In addition, because many choice settings involve familiar
   options that have been previously evaluated, we discuss potential
   implications of the literature on influences of attitudes on behavior
   (which can often be framed as involving a choice to act or not or to act
   in one way rather than another). In each case, we believe that these
   previous social psychological literatures provide insights that could
   enhance and extend the proposed model. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer

AB Dhar and Gorlin (2013) proposed a dual-process framework for
   understanding the effects of preference construction in choice. Drawing
   on the distinction operating principles and operating conditions, it is
   argued that their emphasis on cognitive elaboration fails to specify the
   mental operations involved in preference construction. This limitation
   makes their dual-process framework circular and susceptible to the
   criticism of single-process alternatives. The distinction between
   associative and propositional processes has the potential to fill this
   conceptual gap, thereby providing a more thorough understanding of
   preference construction effects in choice. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer

AB Dhar and Gorlin show that default-interventionist dual-process theory
   differentially classifies several effects in the consumer choice
   literature and makes differential predictions across a variety of
   manipulations. One of the most startling differential classifications in
   their model is that it drives a wedge between the attraction and
   enhancement effects, because they arise from System 1 and System 2,
   respectively. System-2 bias effects explain why sometimes less complex
   organisms (nonhumans, human children) can display more normative
   behavior than human adults. Such a finding does not at all undermine the
   heuristics and biases research tradition, as is sometimes argued. (C)

   importance of automatic preference for the color white over black in
   product choice and advertising contexts. Across three studies, we
   incorporate multiple Implicit Association Tests to assess automatic
   preferences for colors, products, races, and advertisements. In Study 1,
   we demonstrate an automatic color preference for white over black, show
   that this preference holds for Caucasian-Americans and
   African-Americans, and find that automatic color preference predicts
   automatic product preference of white over black-colored products. Study
   2 extends these findings by showing that actual behavioral product
   choice is best predicted by a combination of automatic and explicit
   color preferences. In the advertising domain, Study 3 demonstrates how
   automatic color preference influences advertising responses and how it
   explains the lack of in-group preference by African-Americans in
   previous implicit studies of racial preference. Collectively, our
   research draws attention to the need to disentangle white and black as

   research, we present a new framework for understanding attitude
   certainty and how consumers' attitude certainty is shaped by their
   resisting or yielding to persuasive messages, or even by their
   reflections on the evidence supporting their attitudes. We propose that
   attitude certainty is formed and changed largely through an
   attribution-based reasoning process linked to a finite set of distinct
   appraisals. Our framework is used to both organize past research and
   offer guidance for future research endeavors. In addition, we
   distinguish our framework of appraisal-based attitude certainty from
   past models in attitudes and persuasion research that have referenced or
   taken note of the attitude certainty construct. Implications and future
   directions for the study of consumer behavior are discussed. (C) 2013

AB This research examines how package size can influence quality judgments
   for packaged goods, and also identifies a price-based mechanism for the
   observed size quality relationship. Results from several studies show
   that a product in a smaller package is rated more favorably than the
   equivalent product in a larger package. Further, this effect is due to
   the smaller package being associated with a higher unit price (despite
   having a lower overall price), which suggests that unit price
   information is more diagnostic than overall price information when
   forming judgments of product quality. We also find a
   theoretically-derived reversal of this effect under conditions in which
   the greater diagnosticity of unit price is overwhelmed by its lower ease
   of use. Namely, when overall price is the only explicitly-provided price
   cue and consumers are too distracted to estimate unit price, a larger
   package is now rated as being better. Finally, two concluding studies
   examine the downstream consequences of changes in package size, building
   off our basic conceptualization to document effects on product choice as
   well as consumption experience. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

AB At times, consumers are motivated to reduce the influence of a product
   recommendation on their judgments. Based on previous research, it is
   unclear whether this correction process will increase or decrease
   consumers' confidence in their judgments. We find that source
   credibility moderates the effect of correction on confidence: correction
   decreases confidence when a product recommendation comes from a high
   credibility source but increases confidence when the same message comes
   from a low credibility source. As a result, correction increases the
   effectiveness of recommendations from low credibility sources on
   purchase intentions. Notably, this "confidence via correction" effect is
   further moderated by elaboration, such that the effect is attenuated for
   high elaboration consumers. Our results have implications for
   understanding consumers' reactions to persuasive messages and for both
   marketing practitioners and consumer protection agencies using
   correction cues to influence message persuasiveness. (C) 2013 Society

AB The present research examined the dynamic interplay between the framing
   of one's progress from an initial state toward an end state (i.e.,
   framed as the distance traveled from the initial state to the current
   state -'to-date' versus framed as the distance left from the current
   state to the end state -'to-go') and construal level in influencing
   motivation in goal pursuit. In three experiments we found that both
   state and chronic differences in experienced construal level modulate
   the impact of progress framing on motivation at a specific stage in goal
   pursuit, i.e., when consumers are halfway between the initial and end
   state, but is less consequential at the initial or end stages. This
   modulation shows that type of framing only affected motivation of people
   with an abstract, but not a concrete mindset. Under these conditions,
   progress framed in terms of to-date produced increased motivation
   compared to a to-go frame. Moreover, perceived goal distance was found
   to mediate the impact of progress framing on motivation for individuals
   with an abstract, but not a concrete mindset. (C) 2013 Society for

AB Vanity sizing has become a popular retail trend and recent work shows it
   has a favorable impact on consumers. However, as the current research
   demonstrates, significant variations in sizing standards across
   retailers mean that consumers are as likely to encounter larger sizes as
   they are smaller, "vanity" sizes when shopping, highlighting the
   importance of understanding how consumers react to this potential threat
   in the marketplace. Across five studies we demonstrate that larger sizes
   result in negative evaluations of clothing and show that these effects
   are driven by consumers' appearance self-esteem. Importantly, we also
   find that instead of unilaterally lowering purchase intent as one might
   assume, larger sizes can actually increase spending, as consumers engage
   in compensatory consumption to help repair their damaged self-esteem. In
   so doing, this research reveals a dynamic and complex relationship
   between consumers and sizing labels, where shopping can serve to build,
   strengthen, threaten, and/or repair appearance self-esteem. (C) 2013

AB Today's business interactions are characterized by encounters between

   and under what circumstances regional or foreign speech patterns affect
   consumer judgments and reactions. Building on a synthesis of accent
   research and theories, including the work of related disciplines such as
   linguistics and social psychology, this article suggests an integrative
   model that helps to understand accent effects in business contexts. The
   model disentangles the effects of social categorization, stereotype
   activation, and speech processing that jointly influence different
   business-related outcomes. The model highlights three categories of
   factors that moderate these accent effects, namely sender, receiver, and
   communication variables. The paper further identifies several issues
   which remain unresolved and which require continued research. An agenda
   for future research sets out several propositions to help researchers

AB There has been a recent swell of interest in marketing as well as
   psychology pertaining to the role of sensory experiences in judgment and
   decision making. Within marketing, the field of sensory marketing has
   developed which explores the role of the senses in consumer behavior. In
   psychology, the dominant computer metaphor of information processing has
   been challenged by researchers demonstrating various manners in which
   mental activity is grounded in sensory experience. These findings are
   arduous to explain using the amodal model of the human mind. In this
   introduction, we first delineate key assumptions of the information
   processing paradigm and then discuss some of the key conceptual
   challenges posed by the research generally appearing under the titles of
   embodiment, grounded cognition, or sensory marketing. We then address
   the use of bodily feelings as a source of information; next, we turn to
   the role of context sensitive perception, imagery, and simulation in
   consumer behavior, and finally discuss the role of metaphors. Through
   this discourse, we note the contributions to the present special issue
   as applicable. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

   a food engenders spontaneous simulations of the taste of that food item,
   which by itself is enough to produce satiation. These findings establish

AB As mouse-driven desktop computers give way to touchpad laptops and
   touchscreen tablets, the role of touch in online consumer behavior has
   become increasingly important. This work presents initial explorations
   into the effects of varying touch-based interfaces on consumers, and
   argues that research into the interfaces used to access content can be
   as important as research into the content itself. Two laboratory studies
   using a variety of touch technologies explore how touchscreen interfaces
   can increase perceived psychological ownership, and this in turn
   magnifies the endowment effect. Touch interfaces also interact with
   importance of product haptics and actual interface ownership in their
   effects on perceived product ownership, with stronger effects for
   products high in haptic importance and interfaces that are owned.
   Results highlight that perceptions of online products and marketing
   activities are filtered through the lens of the interfaces used to
   explore them, and touch-based devices like tablets can lead to higher
   product valuations when compared to traditional computers. (C) 2013

AB Extant embodied cognition research suggests that individuals can reduce
   a perceived lack of interpersonal warmth by substituting physical
   warmth, and vice versa. We suggest that this behavior is self-regulatory
   in nature and that this self-regulation can be accomplished via
   consumptive behavior. Experiment 1 found that consumers perceived
   ambient temperature to be significantly lower when eating alone compared
   to eating with a partner. Experiment 2 found that consuming a cool (vs.
   warm) drink led individuals to generate more socially-oriented
   attributes for a hypothetical product. Experiment 3 found that
   physically cooler individuals desired a social consumption setting,
   whereas physically warmer individuals desired a lone consumption
   setting. We interpret these results within the context of
   self-regulation, such that perceived physical temperature deviations
   from a steady state unconsciously motivate the individual to find bodily
   balance in order to alleviate that deviation. (C) 2013 Society for

   of social closeness to other decision-makers, thus leading them to
   consider the opinions of those decision-makers to have greater validity.
   This enhanced validity, in turn, rendered them more likely to conform to
   the crowd. This effect was confirmed in an analysis of betting behavior
   at the racetrack over a three-year period. Bets were more likely to

AB One important psychological mechanism of advertising is mere exposure
   inducing positive attitudes towards brands. Recent basic research has
   shown that the underlying mechanism of mere exposure for words, in turn,
   is the training of subvocal pronunciation, which can be obstructed by
   oral motor-interference. Commercials for foreign brands were shown in
   cinema sessions while participants either ate popcorn, chewed gum (oral
   interference) or consumed a single sugar cube (control). Brand choice
   and brand attitudes were assessed one week later. While control
   participants more likely spent money (Experiment 1, N = 188) and
   exhibited higher preference and physiological responses (Experiment 2, N
   = 96) for advertised than for novel brands, participants who had
   consumed popcorn or gum during commercials showed no advertising
   effects. It is concluded that advertising might be futile under
   ecological situations involving oral interference, such as snacking or
   talking, which ironically is often the case. (C) 2013 Society for

   that the preference for glossy sterns from an innate preference for

   demonstrate the preference for glossy among both adults and young
   children (studies 1A, 1B and 2) ruling out a socialization explanation,
   investigate the hypothesis that the preference for glossy stems from an
   innate need for water as a resource (studies 3 and 5) and, in addition,
   rule out the more superficial account of glossy = pretty (study 4). The
   interplay between the different perspectives, implications of the
   findings and future research directions are discussed. (C) 2013 Society

   Schmeichel, 2012), four studies examined the idea that activation of
   different levels of the dryness thirst metaphor (e.g., semantic primes,

   Study 1, participants primed with dryness-related concepts reported
   greater physical thirst and tiredness and lower subjective vitality. In
   Study 2, participants who were physically thirsty were less persistent
   in investing effort in an unsolvable anagram task. In Study 3, images of
   arid land influenced time preference regarding when to begin preparation
   to make a monetary investment. Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b, exposure

   hampers motivation and performance by boosting self-worth. A pilot study
   shows that the imagination of vertical movements affects self-worth.
   Studies 1, 2 and 3 show that imagining upward movements (e.g., taking an
   elevator ride up or taking off in an airplane) diminishes motivation as
   well as performance. Studies 4 and 5 show that imagining moving upward
   (downward) makes people feel better (worse) about themselves which, in
   turn, decreases (increases) their motivation to succeed on a subsequent
   task, hence worsening (improving) performance. This occurs independently
   of respondents' mood. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated that the ownership of a product leads
   to a biased perception of its aspects. Based on research on embodied
   cognition, we argue that the physical action of hand washing can reset
   the cognitive system to a more neutral state by reducing the
   asymmetrical perception of owned and not owned products. In three
   studies, we examined the effects of hand washing on the endowment effect
   by asking owners of a product to exchange it for a similar one. As
   expected, in Experiment 1, we showed that hand washing doubled the
   percentage of participants who exchanged an owned product for an
   alternative product. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding and
   showed that only the action of hand washing and not a prime of physical
   cleaning elicited this effect. In Experiment 3, we again replicated the
   hand washing effect on exchange rates and examined the effect of hand
   washing on product evaluations. The results of all experiments suggest
   that hand washing reduces decision preferences that are biased by
   ownership. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Through five experiments, this research advances knowledge about the
   influence of metaphors on creative cognition by showing that perceiving
   images that carry metaphoric meaning can alter consumers' creativity.
   While the results of Experiment 1 reveal that positive metaphors
   representing ideas like "Thinking outside the box" increase creative
   output, Experiment 2 uncovers that a negative metaphor conveying "I am
   burnt out" decreases it. Experiment 3 shows that the metaphor-creativity
   link is moderated by analogical reasoning skills, and Experiments 4a and
   4b reveal the mediating role of creative intent. In addition to implying
   that marketers can use metaphors to enhance consumers' creative feedback
   in areas like new product development, this research also makes
   important theoretical contributions by showing (I) that metaphors that
   are visually conveyed (in addition to tangible objects or physical
   exercises) can not only raise but also lower creative output, (2) that a
   unique cognitive skill alters the metaphor-creativity link, and (3) that
   consumers' creative intent contributes to that relationship. (C) 2013

AB The primary goal of this research is to conceptualize and develop a
   scale of green consumption values, which we define as the tendency to
   express the value of environmental protection through one's purchases
   and consumption behaviors. Across six studies, we demonstrate that the
   six-item measure we develop (i.e., the GREEN scale) can be used to
   capture green consumption values in a reliable, valid, and parsimonious
   manner. We further theorize and empirically demonstrate that green
   consumption values are part of a larger nomological network associated
   with conservation of not just environmental resources but also personal
   financial and physical resources. Finally, we demonstrate that the GREEN
   scale predicts consumer preference for environmentally friendly
   products. In doing so, we demonstrate that stronger green consumption
   values increase preference for environmentally friendly products through
   more favorable evaluations of the non-environmental attributes of these
   products. These results have important implications for consumer
   responses to the growing number of environmentally friendly products.

AB People often shop when feeling sad, but whether and why shopping reduces
   residual (lingering) sadness remains an open question. Sadness is
   strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the
   outcomes in one's life, and thus we theorized that the choices inherent
   in shopping may restore personal control over one's environment and
   reduce residual sadness. Three experiments provided support for our
   hypothesis. Making shopping choices helped to alleviate sadness whether
   they were hypothetical (Experiment 1) or real (Experiment 2). In
   addition, all experiments found support for the underlying mechanism of
   personal control restoration. Notably, the benefits of restored personal
   control over one's environment do not generalize to anger (Experiments 2
   and 3), because anger is associated with a sense that other people
   (rather than situational forces) are likely to cause negative outcomes,
   and these appraisals are not ameliorated by restoring personal control
   over one's environment. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.

   we conduct a meta-analysis to more fully articulate the role of
   important conceptual moderators and demonstrate their differential
   effects on evaluation, behavioral intention, and behavior. In
   particular, we look at the source of regulatory focus (self-prime,
   situation-prime, chronic), the orientation (prevention, promotion), how
   fit is created (sustaining, matching), how fit is constructed (action,
   observation), and the scope of fit (incidental, integral). We also shed
   light on the role of several contextual factors. (C) 2013 Society for

   found that observers would blame wrongdoers more when seeing a
   transgression enacted for little rather than a lot of money, and that
   this would be evident in observers' hand-washing behavior. Experiment 1
   used a cognitive dissonance paradigm. Participants (N = 160) observed a
   confederate lie in exchange for either a relatively large or a small
   monetary payment. Participants blamed the liar more in the small (versus
   large) money condition. Participants (N = 184) in Experiment 2 saw
   images of someone knocking over another to obtain a small, medium, or
   large monetary sum. In the small (versus large) money condition,
   participants blamed the perpetrator (money) more. Hence, participants
   assigned less blame to moral wrong-doers, if the latter enacted their
   deed to obtain relatively large sums of money. Small amounts of money
   accentuate the immorality of others' transgressions. (C) 2013 Society

   difficulty can undermine product evaluation through the feelings of
   ease-of-retrieval heuristic among low-accuracy individuals, regardless

   contrast, the findings indicate that metacognitive difficulty can
   enhance (vs. undermine) product evaluation among high-accuracy
   individuals through the self-validation process when there is a
   perceived fit (vs. misfit) between expected and experienced difficulty.
   We suggest that individuals under high accuracy motivation are more

   influences the choice between healthy versus indulgent foods through its

AB Partitioned pricing is a widely used pricing strategy, but little is
   known about the buyer characteristics that influence its effectiveness.
   The current research contributes to the pricing literature by
   investigating the impact of regulatory focus on the perceived
   attractiveness of partitioned and combined pricing. In four studies, we
   hypothesized and found support for the idea that promotion focused
   individuals perceive partitioned prices to be more attractive than
   combined prices, while prevention focused individuals do not
   differentiate between the two pricing types. Our results also show that
   regulatory focus influences consumers' information processing style,
   which in turn leads to important differences in attitudes towards
   partitioned and combined pricing. Specifically, promotion focused
   consumers are more likely to engage in global processing and global
   processing is linked to preferences for partitioned (versus combined)
   prices. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier

AB Consumers frequently encounter moral violations in everyday life. They
   watch movies and television shows about crime and deception, hear news
   reports of corporate fraud and tax evasion, and hear gossip about
   cheaters and thieves. How does exposure to moral violations influence
   consumption? Because moral violations arouse disgust and because disgust
   is an evolutionarily important signal of contamination that should
   provoke a multi-modal response, we hypothesize that moral violations
   affect a key behavioral response to disgust: reduced oral consumption.
   In three experiments, compared with those in control conditions, people
   drank less water and chocolate milk while (a) watching a film portraying
   the moral violations of incest, (b) writing about moral violations of
   cheating or theft, and (c) listening to a report about fraud and
   manipulation. These findings imply that "moral disgust" influences
   consumption in ways similar to core disgust, and thus provide evidence

AB We argue that women's previously documented unresponsiveness to sexual
   primes when making economic decisions may be a consequence of the
   specific types of primes that have been used (i.e., visual primes). In
   three studies we show that presenting women with tactile sexual cues
   does influence their decisions about economic rewards. Similar to the
   effect found in men, the first study demonstrates that touching a pair
   of boxer shorts leads to a craving for monetary rewards in women. In the
   second study it is shown that touching a pair of boxers makes women less
   loss averse for both money and food. The third study explicitly focuses
   on the relative effectiveness of tactile versus visual sexual cues in
   altering women's economic decisions, and reveals that women's
   willingness-to-pay for economic rewards increases only when the sexual
   cue is tactile. We suggest that touching (vs. seeing) sexually laden
   stimuli prompts pre-programmed consummatory Pavlovian responses that
   promote approaching economic rewards. (C) 2013 Society for Consumer

AB We first choose what to eat and then we choose how much to eat. Yet as
   consumer psychologists, we understand food choice much better than food
   consumption quantity. This review focuses on three powerful drivers of
   food consumption quantity: 1) Sensory cues (how your senses react), 2)
   emotional cues (how you feel), and 3) normative cues (how you believe
   you are supposed to eat). These drivers influence consumption quantities
   partly because they bias our consumption monitoring how much attention
   we pay to how much we eat. To date, consumption quantity research has
   comfortably focused on the first two drivers and on using education to
   combat overeating. In contrast, new research on consumption norms can
   uncover small changes in the eating environment (such as package
   downsizing, smaller dinnerware, and reduced visibility and convenience)
   that can be easily implemented in kitchens, restaurants, schools, and
   public policies to improve our monitoring of how much we eat and to help
   solve mindless overeating. It is easier to change our food environment
   than to change our mind. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology.

   health strategies such as taxation and restriction of child-targeted
   marketing in schools. In this commentary, we discuss four food policy
   issues that would benefit from consumer psychology research: (a) the
   restriction of food marketing to children, (b) provision of nutrition
   information through food labels, (c) improving school food environments,
   and (d) placing limits on portion sizes. Identifying effective solutions

AB In their commentary of our "Slim by Design" article, Herman and Polivy
   offer a simple and powerful model of food intake which focuses on the
   mediating role of hunger, taste, and appropriateness. In their
   commentary, Roberto, Pomeranz, and Fisher review both new and classic
   interventions aimed at reducing obesity and raise the issue of whether
   they can be scalable and sustainable without regulatory oversight. In
   this rejoinder, we examine the few differences between the Chandon &
   Wansink and the Herman & Polivy frameworks to highlight critical areas
   for future research, including focusing on overeating vs. intake,
   refining the role of normative drivers, and studying lay theories of
   overeating. We then resolve the questions raised by Roberto, Pomeranz,
   and Fisher by providing concrete examples of low-cost design changes
   that are scalable and sustainable because they benefit both healthy
   eating and the overall sales and profitability of school and workplace
   cafeterias. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB This research shows in a series of studies that exposing consumers to
   functional products evokes the naive theory of popularity, whereas
   exposing them to self-expressive products induces belief in the naive
   theory of exclusivity. The research further demonstrates that when the
   naive theory elicited by product type is matched by the appropriate
   contextual purchasing cues regarding the interest of others, it results
   in greater purchase intentions than when those cues are mismatched. The
   research specifies that the matching effect for functional products is
   mediated by consumers' perceptions of product quality, whereas mediation
   for self-expressive products occurs through consumers' self-perceptions
   regarding the extent to which the product conveys uniqueness. Finally,
   the research illustrates that an explicit signal of product quality
   (e.g., a favorable rating in Consumer Reports) attenuates the effect
   associated with the contextual cues regarding the interest of others.

AB Consumers often encounter goods and services that provide cues to mark
   their progress. We define the term "goal progress cues" to reflect the
   diverse category of cues that highlight progress towards a goal. Across
   a series of three studies, we show that entity theorists, who rely on
   cues that highlight completion in order to signal their abilities to
   others, evaluate tasks that include these cues more favorably than those
   that lack these features. In contrast, incremental theorists, who focus
   on improving competence, are impacted only by progress cues that
   highlight learning. We demonstrate these findings across a variety of
   goal pursuit contexts that represent a mix of customer-centric (retail
   queues), service-oriented managerial (sales calls), and personal
   achievement consumer product (mazes) domains using both behavioral and
   self-reported measures. We conclude with a discussion about the
   theoretical and substantive implications of our findings. (C) 2014

   effect. Using different self-control goals (i.e., savings and healthy
   eating) and different measures of self-control ability (i.e.,
   willingness to buy and actual consumption), this study reveals that when
   people were primed with cues related to a self-control goal and then
   depleted, the effect of depletion on a subsequent self-control task
   (related to the primed goal) became attenuated. Also, depleted people,
   relative to nondepleted people, reported a lower level of commitment to
   a self-control goal; however, when cues related to a self-control goal
   were primed, their level of goal commitment increased, weakening the
   depletion effect. This research clarifies questions related to the
   process underlying depletion, while highlighting the importance of goal
   commitment (a measure of motivation) in understanding depletion. (C)

AB We suggest that a consideration of consumer self-evaluations is
   fundamental to understanding the conditions under which it is more
   advantageous to present person or product pictures in print
   advertisements. We build on the basic human motives of self-enhancement
   and self-verification to propose that the specific self-esteem level of
   consumers, in the domain relevant for the category, differentially
   affects their responses to picture type. Specifically, for consumers
   with low (high) domain-specific self-esteem, depicting a product
   (person) in the advertisement enhances attitudes toward the
   advertisement more than depicting a person (product). In two studies, we
   demonstrate the proposed matching relationships using two different
   domains of consumer self-evaluation: appearance self-esteem and academic
   self-esteem. We also show that increased and more fluent generation of
   self-related mental imagery drives the observed improvement in attitudes
   toward the advertisement. Our findings suggest direct implications for

AB When stockouts restrict consumers' freedoms, two independent responses
   can occur: product desirability, or a reactance-based increase in the
   desire for the unavailable option, and source negativity, or general
   frustration with the source of the restriction. In four studies, we
   provide a novel investigation of consumer responses to
   stockout-restoration and examine how these two forces combine to affect
   consumer responses after freedoms are restored. To do so, we investigate
   two moderators that influence the activation and strength of product
   desirability and source negativity, respectively: trait reactance and
   attributions. While all consumers experience source negativity in
   response to stockouts, only consumers high in reactance experience
   product desirability, leading to differential responses to
   stockout-restoration. Compared to an in-stock condition, high reactance
   consumers respond positively to stockout-restoration, while low
   reactance consumers respond negatively to stockout-restoration, in terms
   of store and product evaluations and store choice. However, when high
   reactants attribute a stockout to the store, thereby increasing source
   negativity relative to product desirability, they respond negatively to
   stockout-restoration. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB This paper documents the multifaceted nature of pride in consumer
   behavior. Drawing on recent psychological research on pride, we provide
   evidence for two separate facets of pride in consumption. In a series of
   studies, we propose a model wherein luxury brand consumption and pride
   are systematically interrelated. Whereas authentic (but not hubristic)
   pride leads to a heightened desire for luxury brands, hubristic (but not
   authentic) pride is the outcome of these purchases, and is the form of
   pride signaled to observers by these purchases. Further, we show that
   these effects are generally exacerbated for those low in narcissism.
   These findings shed new light on why consumers purchase luxury brands,
   highlighting a paradox: these purchases may be sought out of heightened
   feelings of accomplishment (and not arrogance), but they instead signal
   arrogance to others (rather than accomplishment). Crown Copyright (C)

AB The use of idealized advertising models has been heavily criticized in
   recent years. Existing research typically adopts a social comparison
   framework and shows that upward comparisons with models can lower
   self-esteem and affect, as well as produce maladaptive behavior.
   However, the alternative possibility that consumers can cope with
   threatening advertising models by excelling in other behavioral domains
   has not been examined. The present research draws on fluid compensation
   theory (Tesser, 2000) and shows that idealized models motivate improved
   performance in consumer domains that fall outside that of the original
   comparison. These more positive coping effects operate through
   self-discrepancies induced by idealized models, rather than self-esteem
   or negative affect. Specifically, self-discrepancies motivate consumers
   to improve decision-making by: 1) making more optimal choices from
   well-specified consideration sets, and 2) better self-regulating
   indulgent choices. More broadly, the current research integrates and
   extends theories of fluid compensation and self-discrepancy, as well as
   provides a more complete picture of the ways in which consumers cope
   with idealized advertising models. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB People often share opinions and information with their social ties, and
   word of mouth has an important impact on consumer behavior. But what
   drives interpersonal communication and why do people talk about certain
   things rather than others? This article argues that word of mouth is
   goal driven and serves five key functions (i.e., impression management,
   emotion regulation, information acquisition, social bonding, and
   persuasion). Importantly, I suggest these motivations are predominantly
   self- (rather than other) serving and drive what people talk about even
   without their awareness. Further, these drivers make predictions about
   the types of news and information people are most likely to discuss.
   This article reviews the five proposed functions and well as how
   contextual factors (i.e., audience and communication channel) may
   moderate which functions play a larger role. Taken together, the paper
   provides insight into the psychological factors that shape word of mouth
   and outlines additional questions that deserve further study. (C) 2014

   that individuals will choose closure-associated behaviors. Specifically,
   we explore the possibility that interruptions that occur during the
   climactic moments of a task or activity can produce a heightened need
   for psychological closure. When an interruption prevents individuals
   from achieving closure in the interrupted domain, we show that the
   resulting unsatisfied need for psychological closure can cause
   individuals to seek closure in totally unrelated domains. These findings
   have important implications for understanding how consumer decisions may

   rather limited in progress made. This paper strives to reinvigorate such
   inquiry. We begin by describing four major theories of gender
   differences (socio-cultural, evolutionary, hormone-brain, and the
   selectivity hypothesis) and then assess relevant research from 2000 to
   2013 in marketing, psychology, and biomedicine. From this, five
   conclusions emerge: Males are more self-oriented, while females are more
   other-oriented; females are more cautious responders; females are more
   responsive to negative data; males process data more selectively and
   females more comprehensively; and females are more sensitive to
   differentiating conditions and factors. We conclude by identifying
   several areas of opportunity for advancing our understanding of gender
   differences. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB To live in the developed world is to live in a consumerist society.
   Although the broader forces that created this society have led to
   unprecedented material abundance, scholars have maintained that these
   benefits have come at a significant psychological cost. An important
   question, then, is how these psychological costs can be minimized. With
   that in mind, we review research showing that people derive more
   satisfaction from experiential purchases than material purchases. We
   then summarize the findings of an extensive program of research on the
   psychological mechanisms that underlie this difference. This research
   indicates that experiential purchases provide greater satisfaction and
   happiness because: (1) Experiential purchases enhance social relations
   more readily and effectively than material goods; (2) Experiential
   purchases form a bigger part of a person's identity; and (3)
   Experiential purchases are evaluated more on their own terms and evoke
   fewer social comparisons than material purchases. We conclude by
   discussing how social policy might be altered to take advantage of the
   greater hedonic return offered by experiential investments, thus
   advancing societal well-being. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Early adopters are considered essential to new product success due to
   their role in encouraging others to adopt. In this paper, we show that
   this may not always be true. Early adopters with a high need for
   uniqueness may experience a communication dilemma of whether or not to
   communicate about innovations they adopt. The dilemma derives from the
   clash between their need to flaunt the innovation they adopted and their
   desire to preserve their uniqueness by preventing imitation by others.
   We suggest that this dilemma might be resolved by a "share and scare"
   strategy, in which early adopters share information about their adoption
   with others yet scare them out of adopting it. In a series of four
   studies, we demonstrate early adopters' communication dilemma, the
   "share and scare" strategy, and three moderators that confirm our
   theory. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier

AB U.S. Federal regulation from 2009 requires credit card companies to
   convey information regarding payoff scenarios, i.e., details such as
   total amount paid and time to pay off when only a minimum payment is
   made (over time). Across seven studies, the present research shows that
   consumers who were given a dual payoff scenario (i.e., how much is paid
   in total based on the minimum payment and also based on a 3-year payoff
   window) on credit card statements recommended lower payments than those
   given a single payoff scenario (when the 3-year payment amount was less
   than what they would have paid otherwise), and were less likely to pay
   off the balance in full. The effect is driven by a tendency of consumers
   to infer that the 3-year payment amount is the most appropriate. The
   dual-scenario effect is minimized by an intervention that draws
   attention away from the 3-year payment amount. Theoretical and public
   policy implications are considered. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB The experience recommendation if you want to be happier, buy life
   experiences instead of material items is supported in empirical

   comparison of material items and life experiences. The goal of this
   article is to examine the effects of consuming experiential products
   purchases that fall between material items and life experiences on
   well-being. Study 1 and Study 2 demonstrate that experiential products
   provide similar levels of well-being compared to life experiences and
   more well-being than material items. Study 3 replicates this finding for
   purchases that turn out well. In addition, Study 3 shows experiential
   products, when compared to life experiences, lead to more feelings of
   competence but less feelings of relatedness, which explains why these
   two purchases result in similar levels of well-being. We discuss why
   experiential products and life experiences lead to psychological need
   satisfaction and how our results support the Positive-Activity Model,
   Self-Determination Theory, and Holbrook and Hirschman's hedonic

   affect intensity predict people's responses to food advertisements. In
   doing so, we aim to uncover individual differences and situational
   factors that are associated with higher food cravings and other
   consumptionrelated responses. Studies 1 and 2 identified three mediators
   (emotional memories, weak impulse control, and the intensity of pleasure
   anticipation) which indirectly link affect intensity to food cravings
   and behavioral intentions. Studies 3 and 4 identified two moderators
   (vividness of advertisement, dieting status of participants) of the
   relationship between affect intensity and consumption-related outcomes.
   In Study 3 high affect intensity individuals reported stronger food
   cravings only in response to vivid advertising appeals. In Study 4,
   respondents with high levels of positive affectivity, a sub-dimension of
   affect intensity, experienced increased salivation, but especially when
   they were dieters exposed to vivid food images. Implications for theory
   development and for marketing and public policy strategists are

AB This research details the development of the "comfort with interpersonal
   touch" (CIT) scale designed to measure individual differences in
   interpersonal touch tendencies and preferences. The CIT construct is
   defined as the degree to which an individual is comfortable with
   intentional interpersonal touch from or to another person. The scale
   incorporates the distinction between initiating touch, which is the act
   of touching someone else, and receiving touch, which is the act of being
   touched by someone else. Investigation of this construct includes scale
   development, measure purification, and validation. We situate
   CIT-initiating and CIT-receiving within an approach avoidance framework
   and demonstrate that comfort with initiating touch is more related to
   approach tendencies such as assertiveness while comfort with receiving
   touch is more related to avoidant tendencies such as avoiding crowded
   spaces. While previous research generally finds positive effects of
   interpersonal touch, we find that these effects, at least in part,
   depend on an individual's comfort with interpersonal touch. We discuss
   theoretical and managerial implications as well as future research
   opportunities using the CIT scale. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB In the cause-related marketing (CRM) literature, the degree of fit
   between a firm and cause has been shown to positively impact the
   effectiveness of CRM campaigns. Throughout the literature, however,
   firm-cause fit has been operationalized as the relatedness of conceptual
   attributes such as brand image and positioning (i.e., conceptual
   congruence). Across three studies, the authors demonstrate that the
   relatedness of perceptual attributes such as color (i.e., perceptual
   congruence) can also enhance the effectiveness of CRM campaigns. Study 1
   shows that perceptual congruence between a firm and cause positively
   affects perceptions of overall fit and participation intentions. Study 2
   provides evidence that perceptual congruence impacts CRM effectiveness
   through a fit-as-fluency mechanism. Finally, Study 3 demonstrates the
   moderating effect of elaboration on the relationship between fit type
   (perceptual vs. conceptual congruence) and participation intentions.
   Consistent with previous findings, elaboration positively affects
   participation intentions when the fit type is conceptual, but the
   results of Study 3 indicate that elaboration negatively impacts
   participation intentions when the fit type is perceptual. (C) 2014

AB Some donation appeals emphasize the magnitude of the help that is
   needed. Other, "bandwagon" appeals emphasize the fact that many others
   have already donated. The relative effectiveness of these appeals can
   depend on individuals' awareness of their mortality. Four experiments
   converge on the conclusion that need-focused appeals are effective when
   individuals are not conscious of their own mortality. When people's
   mortality is salient, however, bandwagon appeals have relatively greater
   influence. This is particularly true when others' donations have put the
   goal of the donation campaign within reach. These effects are evident
   when people have little a priori interest in the individuals being
   helped and sympathy does not play a major role in donation decisions.

   cannot be purchased, and possessions versus experiences do not seem to
   form the endpoints of the same continuum. As an alternative, we present
   a consumer-experience model that views materialism and experientialism
   as two separate dimensions whose effects on consumer happiness, both in
   the form of pleasure and in the form of meaning, depend on the type of
   brand experiences evoked. Thus, a good life in a consumerist society

   develops an integrative framework of the concept of brand authenticity
   and reports the development and validation of a scale measuring
   consumers' perceived brand authenticity (PBA). A multi-phase scale
   development process resulted in a 15-item PBA scale measuring four
   dimensions: credibility, integrity, symbolism, and continuity. This
   scale is reliable across different brands and cultural contexts. We find
   that brand authenticity perceptions are influenced by indexical,
   existential, and iconic cues, whereby some of the latters' influence is
   moderated by consumers' level of marketing skepticism. Results also
   suggest that PBA increases emotional brand attachment and word-of-mouth,
   and that it drives brand choice likelihood through self-congruence for
   consumers high in self-authenticity. 2014 Society for Consumer

AB Despite the voluminous evidence in support of the paradoxical finding
   that providing individuals with more options can be detrimental to
   choice, the question of whether and when large assortments impede choice
   remains open. Even though extant research has identified a variety of
   antecedents and consequences of choice overload, the findings of the
   individual studies fail to come together into a cohesive understanding
   of when large assortments can benefit choice and when they can be
   detrimental to choice. In a meta-analysis of 99 observations (N = 7202)
   reported by prior research, we identify four key factors choice set
   complexity, decision task difficulty, preference uncertainty, and
   decision goal that moderate the impact of assortment size on choice
   overload. We further show that each of these four factors has a reliable
   and significant impact on choice overload, whereby higher levels of
   decision task difficulty, greater choice set complexity, higher
   preference uncertainty, and a more prominent, effort-minimizing goal
   facilitate choice overload. We also find that four of the measures of
   choice overload used in prior research satisfaction/confidence, regret,
   choice deferral, and switching likelihood are equally powerful measures
   of choice overload and can be used interchangeably. Finally, we document
   that when moderating variables are taken into account the overall effect
   of assortment size on choice overload is significant a finding counter
   to the data reported by prior meta-analytic research. (C) 2014 Society

AB The majority of music people listen to in their daily lives includes
   lyrics. This research documents how more repetitive songs lyrically are
   processed more fluently and thus adopted more broadly and quickly in the
   marketplace. Study 1 is a controlled laboratory experiment demonstrating
   how lexical repetition, a feature of the stimulus and not the
   consequence of repeated exposures, results in greater processing
   fluency. Study 2 replicates the effect utilizing custom-produced song
   excerpts holding everything constant except the lyrics. Utilizing data
   from Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart from 1958-2012, Study 3 documents
   how more repetitive songs stand a greater chance of reaching #1 as
   opposed to lingering at the bottom of the chart. An analysis of #1 hits
   reveals increased repetition decreases the time it takes to reach #1 and
   increases the odds of debuting in the Top 40. This research chronicles
   the impact of processing fluency on consumer choice in the real world
   while demonstrating repetition as a stimulus feature matters. It also
   introduces a new variable to the processing fluency literature: lexical
   repetition. 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier

AB Consumers often make choices in settings where some alternatives are
   known and additional alternatives can be unveiled through search. When
   making a choice from a set of alternatives, the manner in which each of
   these was discovered should be irrelevant from a normative standpoint.
   By contrast, we propose that consumers infer from their own decisions to
   search for additional alternatives that previously known alternatives
   are comparatively less attractive, and that this results in an increase
   in preference for an alternative precisely because it was initially out
   of sight (rather than known). Evidence from four experiments provides
   support for this theorizing, demonstrating that paradoxically placing an
   alternative out of sight (while providing the consumer with the
   opportunity to unveil it) can render that alternative more likely to be
   chosen. Moreover, the findings indicate that this shift in preferences
   is driven specifically by a devaluation of alternatives that were known
   prior to the decision to search. Finally, the preference-signaling
   effect of search is shown to be persistent in that it systematically
   influences a consumer's subsequent choices among new alternatives. (C)

   exposure to the concept of emptiness by simply performing or observing
   acts of emptying (vs. filling or control) of a glass vase, coat pockets,
   a glass jar, or a duffle bag triggers the cognitive metaphor of resource
   deficiency. The resource deficiency metaphor in turn leads people to

   donating to charities or helping others. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB Individuals acknowledge the importance of engaging in virtuous
   behaviors, but find them difficult. Past research suggests that a
   distant-future focus may result in more commitment. This researeh
   demonstrates that, for certain consumers, distant-future execution
   timing may discourage commitment. Specifically, whereas low self-control
   consumers are indeed more likely to commit to distant-future behaviors,
   high self-control consumers are more likely to commit to near-future
   behaviors. This is demonstrated when commitment does not hold a cost
   (study 1), but also when it does (study 2). Consumers' time availability
   certainty underlies the effect: Low self-control consumers feel more
   certain that in the distant future they will be able to identify the
   time necessary to fulfill their commitments, whereas high self-control
   consumers feel more certain regarding their ability to identify their
   available time in the near future (studies 3a-3b). The effect is shown
   to occur only when the commitment's time of execution reflects different
   levels of time concreteness: The effect is eliminated among consumers
   who perceive the near and distant future as equally concrete or abstract
   (study 4). (C) 2014 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Knowledge about other people's preferences is essential for successful
   social interactions, but what exactly are the driving factors that
   determine how well we can predict the likes and dislikes of people
   around us? To investigate the accuracy of couples' preference
   predictions we outline and empirically test three hypotheses: The
   positive valence hypothesis predicts that predictions for likes are more
   accurate than for dislikes. The negative valence hypothesis predicts the
   opposite, namely that dislikes are predicted more accurately than
   dislikes. The base rate hypothesis predicts that preference knowledge
   critically depends on the base rates of likes and dislikes within a
   given domain. In a series of studies we show that predicting likes over
   dislikes has relatively little effect compared with base rates. That is,
   accuracy is greater for relatively rare events regardless of whether
   they are liked or disliked. Our findings further suggest that when
   predicting preferences, people seem to rely on a combination of general,
   stereotypical knowledge of common preferences on the one hand and
   specific, idiosyncratic knowledge of rare preferences on the other. (C)

AB Negotiating the pursuit of multiple goals often requires making
   difficult trade-offs between goals. In these situations, consumers can
   benefit from using products that help them pursue several goals at the
   same time. But do consumers always prefer these multipurpose products?
   We propose that consumers' incidental mood state alters perceptions of
   products in a multiple-goal context. Four studies demonstrate that being
   in a positive mood amplifies perceptions of differences between multiple
   conflicting goals. As a consequence, consumers are less likely to
   evaluate multipurpose products as being able to serve multiple distinct
   goals simultaneously. We conclude by discussing implications of these
   findings for marketers of multipurpose products. (C) 2014 Society for

AB Despite recent interest in examining the impact of dirty money on
   consumption-related behavior, researchers have yet to look at the
   influence of dirty money on the consumable itself. Evidence from two
   studies suggest that the documented effects of dirty money on spending
   may have more to do with dirty money contaminating the purchase, as
   opposed to the current belief that consumers merely want to rid
   themselves of disgusting things. The authors find that people indeed
   spend more with dirty money, but only when the bills lower product
   valuations. This does not occur when people purchase products with
   inherent properties that cannot be contaminated; in fact, dirty money
   can increase valuations and preference for these products. The results
   suggest that the physical appearance of money plays a much larger, more
   nuanced role in consumption than previously thought, and this effect may
   not be entirely positive for the consumer. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB Consumers' welfare largely depends on the soundness of their financial
   decisions. To this effect, the present research examines how people
   process graphical displays of financial information (e.g., stock-prices)
   to forecast future trends and invest accordingly. In essence, we ask
   whether and how visual biases in data interpretation impact financial
   decision-making and risk-taking. Five experiments find that the last
   trading day(s) of a stock bear a disproportionately (and unduly) high
   importance on investment behavior, a phenomenon we coin end-anchoring.
   Specifically, a stock-price closing upward (downward) fosters upward
   (downward) forecasts for tomorrow and, accordingly, more (less)
   investing in the present. Substantial investment asymmetries (up to 75%)
   emerge even as stock-price distributions were generated randomly to
   simulate times when the market conjuncture is hesitant and no real
   upward or downward trend can be identified. Allying experimental
   manipulations to eye-tracking technology, the present research begins to
   explore the underpinnings of end-anchoring. (C) 2014 Society for

AB According to temporal construal theory (Trope & Liberman, 2003, 2010),
   people are likely to evaluate a product on the basis of global,
   high-level criteria (e.g., the intrinsic desirability of its features)
   if they consider it for future consumption but consider
   situation-specific (e.g., feasibility-related) criteria if they consider
   it for immediate use. However, this may be true only when people are
   unmotivated to assess the implications of all of the information they
   have available, and this motivation, in turn, is a function of both
   their mood and the goal they happen to be pursuing. When individuals'
   objective is to make a good decision, the theory's implications are more
   likely to be supported when they are happy (and believe they have enough
   information to make a good judgment) than when they are sad. When their
   goal is to enjoy themselves, however, the theory is more strongly
   supported when they are sad (and are unmotivated to engage in extensive
   processing) than when they are happy. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB Self-regulation requires connecting desired goals (benefits sought) with
   means of attainment (implementation plans). Individual differences in
   the consideration of future consequences (CFC) can influence
   self-regulation. Although a high- (low-) CFC orientation has generally
   been considered a preoccupation with future (present) events and needs,
   we argue that a complete characterization also includes the ability
   (less ability) to construct specific action plans. With a mix of lab and
   field studies, we demonstrate that either general implementation
   recommendations or distant benefits trigger planning and motivate
   self-regulation for high-CFC individuals. Specific implementation
   recommendations coupled with proximate benefits help low-CFC individuals
   plan and self-regulate. In Study I, we measure CFC and vary the temporal
   location of benefits and specificity of implementation recommendations
   to motivate exercising and show that self-generated specific plans
   mediate self-regulatory intentions. In Study 2, we assess actual
   self-regulatory behaviors for participants in a walking program. This
   research has theoretical implications for the temporal construal and
   planning literatures and practical implications for increasing
   self-regulation among individuals who do not consider the long-term
   consequences of their current actions. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

   outlines two general approaches that can lead to further our

   information processing. Specifically, future research can examine the
   nature of emotional appraisals or investigate the nature of decision
   contexts and underlying psychological processes influenced by emotions.
   To understand the nature of emotional appraisals, scholars could examine
   the interaction of two appraisal dimensions or identify novel appraisal
   tendencies. To understand the decision-making contexts and psychological
   processes influenced by emotions, scholars could examine how emotions
   interact with contextual influences to shape judgments through a variety
   of processes such as providing information, priming goals, or activating
   mindsets. These approaches to the study of emotions and decision-making
   will contribute to more nuanced theory development around emotions,

AB Consumers chose between options that paired either an objectively

   good with low relative standing (Your laptop is rated 80/100 in quality;
   others' laptops are rated 95/100). Decision makers who try to make the
   "best" decision, known as maximizers (Schwartz et al., 2002), pursued
   relative standing more than decision makers who are satisfied with
   outcomes that are "good enough" (known as satisficers). That is,
   maximizers were more likely than satisficers to choose objectively
   inferior products when they were associated with higher relative
   standing. Subsequent analyses investigating decisions across time showed
   that maximizers' interest in relative standing persisted even when the
   nature of the tradeoff was made overt, suggesting it is a conscious
   aspect of the maximizer identity. Overall, results suggest that the
   maximizer self concept is more complex than has been previously assumed
   they are focused on relative outcomes in addition to absolute outcomes.

   that when a consumer's relevant identity is inferior to the primed
   social identity, product attitudes suffer. The process accounting for
   this effect consists of a negative social comparison between the two
   that reduces the consumer's related collective self-esteem. This outcome
   is more (less) apparent under conditions of high comparison salience
   (identification with the inferior in-group). We also demonstrate two
   marketer strategies that alleviate this negative effect: facilitated
   affiliation (i.e., making desired out-group membership appear
   accessible) and indirect self-affirmation (i.e., improving perceptions
   of worth associated with other self identities). The results advance

AB The cultural lens through which an ad is viewed can affect the extent to
   which an endorser of the product in an ad and the message s(he)
   communicates are thought about in relation to one another. Consumers
   with a collectivist mindset tend to think about information
   relationally. Consequently, they consider the endorsement in relation to
   the endorser and this affects their memory for both. It also affects
   recipients' concern with the fit between the endorser's message and the
   endorser and consequently influences their judgments of both the ad and
   the product being advertised. When people have an individualist mindset,
   on the other hand, they appear to treat the endorser and the endorsement
   as independent pieces of information and are less sensitive to their
   fit. Four studies support these conclusions and provide insights into
   how endorser-message relatedness impacts persuasion under different

   information in foods. Results show that nutrition information can be
   incongruent with the cultural norm of food enjoyment distinctively
   associated with French (and not American) identity. This occurs because
   of a conflict between the motivation to enjoy foods activated by a
   salient French identity and the utilitarian nature of nutrition
   information in foods that does not belong to a French-culture mindset.
   Three studies demonstrate that French (and not American) consumers with
   a salient cultural identity are more sensitive (i.e., perceive as
   riskier for their health) and evaluate more negatively foods that
   display (vs. not) nutrition information. Furthermore, this devaluation
   effect is mediated by anticipated feelings that the foods would not be
   enjoyable. Providing further evidence for the motivational inconsistency
   between the culturally-distinctive norm of food enjoyment cued by a
   salient French-culture mindset, French (and not American) consumers with
   a salient (vs. not) cultural identity experienced more disfluency when
   processing nutrition information in foods. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer

AB Building on regulatory focus research, we investigate how certain visual
   elements of an advertising message, such as stylistic properties,
   contribute to regulatory fit and persuasion. Across three experiments,
   we examine how the visual perspective (actor's vs. observer's) through
   which a product is depicted in an ad affects product evaluations among
   participants with different regulatory foci (promotion- vs.
   prevention-focused). Specifically, we find that when an actor's
   perspective is used in an ad to portray a product, regulatory fit occurs
   among promotion-focused (vs. prevention-focused) participants and they
   report more favorable product evaluations; conversely, when an
   observer's perspective is used, regulatory fit occurs among
   prevention-focused (vs. promotion-focused) participants and they
   evaluate the product more favorably. An analysis of internal vs.
   external evaluation thoughts helps explain the persuasion effects. (C)

AB Many consumers view their relationships with brands as part of their
   identity and this affects how they react to a brand's behavior that
   negatively impacts them. In assigning responsibility for negative
   outcomes, individuals often demonstrate a self-serving bias by assigning
   more responsibility to their partner and less to themselves. In three
   studies, we demonstrate that this tendency is resisted among consumers
   holding a strong relational self-view. However, their self-serving bias
   emerges when the outcome represents a near-miss situation in which a
   more favorable counterfactual alternative outcome was highly possible.
   This change in attributions is associated with increased feelings of
   being betrayed and perceived unfairness by the brand even though its
   actions are identical in the near-miss and far-miss situations. (C) 2015

AB Embarrassment has been defined as a social emotion that occurs due to
   the violation of a social norm in public, which is appraised by others
   (what we call "public embarrassment"). We propose that embarrassment can
   also be felt when one violates a social norm in private, or when one
   appraises oneself and violates one's self-concept ("private
   embarrassment"). We develop a typology of embarrassment with two
   underlying dimensions social context (transgression in-public or
   in-private) and mechanism (appraisal by others or by the self). Of the
   four resulting categories, one fits with the dominant "social" view of
   embarrassment, whereas the other three have aspects of privacy. We
   generate triggers for public and private embarrassment and demonstrate
   their similarities in study 1. Study 2 (buying an incontinence drug) and
   study 3 (buying Viagra for impotence versus pleasure) replicate these
   similarities, and also exhibit differences in the experience of public
   and private embarrassment through accompanying physiological reactions,
   action tendencies, and behavioral consequences. Our aim is to expand the
   scope of embarrassment research to include private contexts and
   self-appraisal. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Research on gift giving has devoted considerable attention to
   understanding whether and how givers succeed in choosing gifts that
   match recipients' tastes. On the contrary, this article focuses on how
   recipients' appreciation for a gift depends on the match between the
   gift and the giver. Four studies demonstrate that recipients are
   particularly appreciative when they receive gifts that figuratively
   match the giver, i.e., that contain references to the giver's
   characteristics, because they perceive such gifts as more congruent with
   the giver's identity. This effect is not conditional on inferences
   recipients might make about the giver's motivations or on whether
   recipients have a good relationship with the giver, but relies on the
   match concerning core rather than peripheral characteristics of the
   giver. Importantly for our understanding of identity-based motivation,
   these findings demonstrate in a gift-giving context that
   identity-congruence not only drives consumer behavior, but is also
   appreciated in other people. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB This research builds on the motivational aspects of identity salience,
   finding that social identities direct the allocation of attention in
   identity-syntonic ways. Drawing from identity-based motivation
   (Oyserman, 2009; Reed, et al., 2012) we suggest individuals use
   attention to enhance identity-fit; selectively focusing on cues and
   stimuli that are identity-consistent. In two studies we find that
   activating a social identity drives preferential attention toward
   identity-relevant stimuli. Using a novel paradigm, Study 1 demonstrates
   that individuals strategically focus attention on identity-consistent
   emotional stimuli, while also shifting attention away from
   identity-inconsistent emotional stimuli. Using a dot-probe paradigm,
   Study 2 extends these results to show that individuals allocate
   attention toward both emotional and non-emotional (semantic associates)
   stimuli that are identity-consistent, and away from those that are
   incompatible. Consistent with theories suggesting cognition and
   perception are constructed (James, 1890/1983) and that identities direct
   and influence meaning-making (Oyserman, 2009; Reed et al., 2012), we
   find that social identities drive attention allocation, with
   identity-consistent stimuli receiving greater attention; suggesting that
   an identity's sense-making begins with motivated attention toward
   perceiving an identity-consistent environment. (C) 2015 Society for

AB Research on discrepancies between the actual self and ideal self has
   examined self-discrepancies in knowledge, skills and stature but
   age-based self-discrepancies have only recently received attention and
   so we studied this phenomenon in young adolescents. In three studies we
   identified a product-category contextual cue that apparently caused
   adolescents to respond to an existing age-based self-discrepancy.
   Specifically we found that when the contextual cue was advertising for
   an age-restricted product, adolescents conformed to dissimilar young
   adult advertising models and diverged from similar adolescent models.
   This indicated that the contextual cue caused them to respond to an
   age-based self-discrepancy and use a product associated with the ideal
   self rather than the actual self. Importantly, this response was
   stronger among adolescents that were more dissatisfied with their age.
   With advertising for an age-unrestricted product, adolescents conformed
   to adolescent advertising models and diverged from young adult models.
   Industry policies for age-restricted products assume that similarity
   drives influence and therefore mandate that advertising models be young
   adults rather than adolescents. Our findings suggest this assumption is
   invalid for age-restricted products. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer

AB Brand extensions have the potential to both enhance liking of the brand
   extension and induce positive spillover effects on the parent brand.
   Such dual outcomes enhance the brand's growth potential. We propose and
   empirically demonstrate that three variables endemic to any brand
   extension decision (brand reputation, brand extension fit, brand
   extension benefit innovativeness) jointly impact these positive
   outcomes. For strong reputation brands, these dual outcomes are
   maximized when the brand extension is low in fit and offers innovative
   benefits because low fit motivates consumers to process innovative brand
   extension information more deeply. For weak reputation brands, these
   effects are maximized when the brand extension is high in fit and offers
   innovative benefits because high fit strengthens consumers' trust in the
   weak brand's ability to deliver promoted benefits. The results suggest
   two distinct brand growth strategies for strong and weak reputation
   brands respectively. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

AB Some behavioral researchers occasionally wish to conduct a median split
   on a continuous variable and use the result in subsequent modeling to
   facilitate analytic ease and communication clarity. Traditionally, this
   practice of dichotomization has been criticized for the resulting loss
   of information and reduction in power. More recently, this practice has
   been criticized for sometimes producing Type I errors for effects
   regarding other terms in a model, resulting in a recommendation of the
   unconditional avoidance of median splits. In this paper, we use
   simulation studies to demonstrate more thoroughly than has been shown in
   the literature to date when median splits should not be used, and
   conversely, to provide nuance and balance to the extant literature
   regarding when median splits may be used with complete analytical
   integrity. For the scenario we explicate, the use of a median split is
   as good as a continuous variable. Accordingly, there is no reason to
   outright reject median splits, and oftentimes the median split may be
   preferred as more parsimonious. (C) 2014 Society for Consumer

AB Categorization flexibility, the extent of cross-categorization of
   objects into multiple categories, has been studied in prior research as
   an outcome variable. We study categorization flexibility as an
   independent variable and in the food domain show its influence on
   preference for hedonic or indulgent food items. Hedonic food items are
   attractive due to their tastiness but also unattractive due to their
   caloricity and thus consumers feel inhibited to choose them. We argue
   that food categorization flexibility exerts a disinhibitive influence
   which facilitates preference for hedonic food items. We show such a
   prohedonic effect (using real as well as hypothetical food items) by
   measuring as well as manipulating categorization flexibility and also
   that this effect occurs mainly for those with higher (vs. lower)
   inhibition for hedonic consumption: due to a prevention (vs. promotion)
   or due to a hyperopic (vs. myopic) psychological state. Our results
   suggest that while marketers of hedonic foods may improve sales by
   promoting more food-situation associations, consumers' health will be
   better served if consumers develop fewer, beneficial food-situation
   associations. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Gratitude is a positive emotion experienced when a positive outcome is
   attributed to others. Though often regarded as a virtuous emotion, I
   argue that gratitude may have sweet side effects. Specifically, because
   gratitude involves acknowledging benefits received from the kind (or
   metaphorically sweet) actions of another, individuals may infer that
   they must be deserving of sweetness. As a result, they prefer foods with
   congruent or sweet rather than nonsweet tastes. If gratitude causes
   individuals to prefer sweets because they infer that they must be
   deserving of sweetness, then the effect should be strongest among those
   most likely to infer from a sweet act that they deserve sweetness, such
   as those who are psychologically connected to others (i.e., primed with
   interdependence or shared attributes). The results of six studies
   support these predictions. In particular, individuals selected more
   sweets and fewer non-sweet foods when primed to feel grateful than
   proud, a positive emotion experienced by attributing a positive outcome
   to the self. Furthermore, moderation and mediation support the cognition
   of deserving sweetness as the underlying mechanism. (C) 2015 Society for

   construct of honesty is chronically salient to the individual or because
   of the presence of a monetary motive for the salesperson, obfuscation
   undermines purchase intentions relative to a straightforward "don't
   know" response. In contrast, when expectations of a dishonest response
   are low, an obfuscatory response is as persuasive as an admission of
   lack of knowledge. These effects are mediated by perceived trust in the
   salesperson. Implications are discussed for persuasion theory,
   salesperson influence tactics, and consumer welfare. (C) 2015 Society

AB How do consumers choose to post their brand reviews online? Whereas
   prior research examines what people say online, we investigate where
   consumers post their brand-related consumption experience on an online
   discussion forum. Using the framework of the Persuasion Knowledge Model,
   we suggest that consumers act as intuitive media planners to assess the
   extent to which they can reach their specific goals when targeting
   online audiences. Specifically, we examine the effects of posters'
   motives, message valence, and audience similarity on posting behavior.
   We propose and find that persuasion-motivated consumers focus on whether
   the message is effective in generating interest and emotion from the
   audience; therefore, they are more likely to post positive messages on a
   brand-general forum, such as a product forum, and negative messages on a
   brand-specific forum. In contrast, affiliation-motivated posters
   primarily focus on audience similarity, preferring to post on a forum
   where they perceive the audience as similar to them. Three experiments
   show the different posting patterns under the two motives and
   demonstrate the mediating role of message effectiveness under a
   persuasion motive. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

AB Donation promotions that tie product purchase to charitable
   contributions are common in the marketplace. Yet little is known about
   the sensitivity of different consumer segments to such promotions,
   particularly relative to traditional discount-based promotions. To
   address this void, the authors consider the extent to which consumers in
   traditional demographic segments based on gender and residence vary in
   their propensity to choose donation versus discount promotions. An
   experiment along with a field study using in-market data show that
   female and rural consumers exhibit higher choice probabilities for
   donation promotions than male and urban consumer segments. The
   experimental results also demonstrate that interdependence, at least in
   part, underlies the effect of these demographic and geographic
   segmentation variables on promotion choice. In addition to providing new
   theoretical insights involving interdependence and promotion choice,
   these results offer pragmatic guidance for managers targeting donation
   versus discount promotions to various consumer segments. (C) 2015

   the box even when the box is empty. When the contents of a box are

   benefit from including planned hedonic deviations in the goal-striving
   plan. Two controlled experiments (simulated and real dieting)
   demonstrate that including planned goal deviations during extended goal
   striving, compared with following a straight and rigid goal striving
   process, (1) helps regain self-regulatory resources, (2) helps maintain
   consumers' motivation to pursue with regulatory tasks, and (3) has a
   positive impact on affect experienced, which all contribute to
   facilitate long-term goal-adherence. A third study, conducted with
   current goal-strivers provides further evidence of the benefits of
   planned hedonic deviations for goal pursuit across a variety of goals.

AB Interpersonal connections are often involved in the planning, consuming,
   and reminiscing of special consumption experiences. Yet we have limited
   understanding of how consumers in different stages (planning versus
   reminiscing) influence one another and how this might vary as a function
   of relationship strength. From two experiments, our findings suggest
   that when planning a novel special experience, consumers should be
   cautious of others' reminiscences and, specifically, of memories shared
   by strong ties. In study 1, we found that a memory shared by a strong
   tie increases a consumer's desire to switch a novel experience. In study
   2, we unpacked this effect by examining the role of savoring and
   internalization of memory details. When a memory was shared by a
   stronger (versus weaker) tie, the expected utility of savoring was
   reduced, and the desire to switch to a new experience increased. Post
   analyses suggest that this may be due to differences in the extent to
   which the memory is assimilated as one's own experience. Crown Copyright

AB In the past two decades, pricing research has paid increasing attention
   to instances where a product's price is divided into a base price and
   one or more mandatory surcharges, a practice termed partitioned pricing.
   Recently, partitioned pricing strategies in the marketplace have become
   more pervasive and complex, raising concerns that consumers do not
   always fully attend to or process all price information, and
   underestimate total prices, which in turn influences their purchasing
   behavior. Thus, understanding how partitioned prices affect consumers is
   of increasing interest to consumer researchers, public policy makers,
   and marketing managers. This paper reviews and organizes the academic
   literature on partitioned pricing and proposes an agenda for future
   research. We focus on the psychological processes underlying partitioned
   pricing, to help these three constituencies understand how partitioned
   pricing works, the mechanisms by which it exerts its impact, and the
   appropriate areas where the practice may need regulation to protect
   consumers. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

   The results suggest that competing brands are affected only when a

   brands as less typical of the category with diminished evaluations.
   Crucially, neither core radical innovations introduced by a non-dominant

AB Although lower dialectical thinking has been associated with greater

   moderate attitudes when they result from processing contradictory
   information. Specifically, our studies find that contradictory product
   information is less fluently processed by consumers low (vs. high) in
   dialectical thinking, which reduces their judgmental confidence and, in
   turn, generates more moderate attitudes. We contribute to the literature
   by showing that in contexts of contradictory information integration,
   current theory regarding the consequences of dialectical thinking needs
   to be extended to include not only an attenuation of the extremity
   effect prior research has found, but a complete reversal. Our results
   further imply that processing fluency not only impacts attitude valence
   but, more generally, attitude extremity. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer

AB Prior research on attribute framing has documented a robust
   valence-consistent shift whereby positively valenced options (e.g., 75%
   lean beef) are preferred over equivalent negatively valenced options
   (e.g., 25% fat beef). However, this research has typically explored how
   labels influence judgments of prospective or hypothetical consumption.
   In contrast, we examine how frames interact with actual consumption
   experiences to influence both immediate and retrospective judgments. We
   find evidence of a sleeper framing effect wherein a valence-consistent
   shift emerges for retrospective judgments even when absent immediately
   after consumption. We attribute this effect to differences in how
   consumers integrate the more cognitive information of the frame with the
   more affective information acquired during consumption. Specifically,
   three experiments show that consumers attend to and rely relatively more
   on affective information from experience when making immediate
   judgments, but relatively more on cognitive information from the frame
   when making retrospective judgments. In addition, we identify the
   valence of the experience as an important boundary condition, such that
   the sleeper framing effect is most pronounced when the experience is
   relatively neutral in valence. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB The maximizing tendency denotes individuals' predisposition to look for
   the best option rather than settling for something that passes an
   internal threshold of acceptability. This research examines how
   maximizing affects the compromise effect: the preference for an option
   with relatively intermediate attribute values. Results show that
   maximizers attempt to maximize gains on all attributes (rather than to
   rely on a single, most-important attribute as satisficers do) and make
   more compensatory tradeoffs, which leads to more often choosing a
   compromise option (Studies 2 & 3). Results held whether maximization was
   measured as an individual difference variable (Studies 1 & 2) or
   activated as a decision mindset (Study 3). When asked to make decisions
   for a (fictional) prototypical maximizer, however, people intuited fewer
   compromise choices (Study 4). This article concludes by discussing
   relevant theories on cognitive capacity, regulatory focus, and choice
   context effects, and by offering tangible suggestions for follow-up
   research. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB While consumers believe that knowing the ending of a story will spoil
   their enjoyment of the narrative, recent work shows that spoilers have
   little impact on consumers' actual experiences. The psychological
   mechanism underlying this affective misforecasting, however, is less
   clear. In this research, we propose that compared with real experience,
   affective forecasting may be associated with longer psychological
   distance and high-level construal, which may encourage forecasters to
   assign greater weight to the outcome of a plot. In addition to showing
   the basic effect, we also identify circumstances under which such
   affective misforecasting is less likely to happen or even reverses. In
   line with our theorizing, the results of two studies showed that the
   misforecasting disappeared when participants had chronic or
   situationally primed low (vs. high) construal levels. In the final
   experiment we reversed the previous finding, showing that participants
   underpredicted the negative impact of a spoiler when the spoiler
   revealed the process of a plot. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

AB In four studies, this research investigates the role of perfectionism in
   consumer decision making and demonstrates that perfectionists often make
   inferior decisions when facing difficult tasks. Although perfectionists
   outperform those with low need for perfection at medium levels of
   decision difficulty, their advantages disappear at high levels of
   decision difficulty. Driven by dichotomous thinking, perfectionists give
   up on the task when they realize that a perfect outcome is no longer
   possible and make inferior decisions. Paradoxically, when given the
   opportunity to select their own task, perfectionists sometimes avoid
   tasks over which they have comparative advantage but prefer tasks of
   high complexity, without realizing the effect of dichotomous thinking on
   subsequent choices. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published

AB Mindsets-or implicit theories-are the beliefs people have about the
   nature of human characteristics. This article applies mindset theory and
   research to the field of consumer behavior. Specifically, we suggest how
   a fixed or growth mindset may shape consumer product preferences,
   acceptance of brand extensions, trust recovery following product
   failures, as well as the effectiveness of advertising and marketing
   campaigns. We argue that people with a fixed mindset are more likely to
   seek products and brands in line with their goals to burnish their
   self-image and demonstrate their positive qualities, while people with a
   growth mindset seek products that help them pursue their goals to
   improve and learn new things. Thus, products and brands may serve
   important self-enhancement functions encouraging consumers to reinforce
   or expand core aspects of their identity. We also suggest that brands
   and companies can project a fixed or growth mindset. In turn, these
   organizational mindsets should shape consumers' expectations of, and
   relationships with, products, brands, and companies. (C) 2015 Society

AB In this commentary, we reflect on several important issues and questions
   provoked by Murphy and Dweck's target article. First, we define a
   mindset as a frame of mind that affects the selection, encoding, and
   retrieval of information as well as the types of evaluations and
   responses an individual gives. As such, we suggest that while studying
   fixed versus growth mindsets is important, it is critical to explore and
   understand how a variety of mindsets affect consumer behavior, including
   regulatory focus, construal level, implementation versus deliberation,
   and power. Second, we argue that it is necessary to understand if a
   hierarchy exists among this variety of mindsets, with some mindsets
   being more foundational and more important than others. Finally, we
   raise questions about whether matching effects, where information
   matches a mindset, always produce more persuasion, or whether cases
   might exist where mismatches, or complementarity, are better. (C) 2015

AB Increasing obesity rates and public stigmatization of overweight
   individuals have drawn attention to the need to identify factors that
   influence consumers' choices to eat healthful or unhealthful foods. The
   authors of this paper conduct three empirical studies (using stigma
   manipulation in studies 1 and 2) to test when and why stigmatized
   overweight consumers are likely to eat more (un)healthful foods. The
   results suggest that stigmatized overweight individuals consume more
   calories from healthful foods in public contexts to repair their social
   identity, but consume more calories from unhealthful foods in private
   contexts to repair their affect. Consequently, stigmatized overweight
   consumers end up eating more calories altogether regardless of
   consumption contexts. The findings are important for marketers and
   policymakers to improve overall health and wellbeing, especially for
   overweight consumers. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB While hormones have been shown to impact a wide range of behaviors,
   little is known regarding their influence on consumer behavior. The
   current research examines the association between digit ratios and
   courtship-related consumption. Digit ratios (2D:4D and rel2) are
   indicators of prenatal testosterone exposure and are assessed by
   measuring finger length. In Study 1, masculinized digit ratios (low
   digit ratios, high prenatal testosterone) in men were associated with
   greater courtship-related consumption to acquire mates, and this
   association was stronger for men with high mating confidence. In women,
   feminized digit ratios (high digit ratios, low prenatal testosterone)
   were associated with greater courtship related consumption to acquire
   mates. In Study 2, men with masculinized digit ratios engaged in greater
   courtship-related consumption by offering romantic gifts as a means of
   retaining mates. In women, feminized digit ratios were associated with
   greater romantic gift giving. Our findings suggest that high prenatal
   testosterone in men leads to greater courtship-related consumption,
   whereas low prenatal testosterone leads to greater courtship-related
   consumption in women. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Extending previous research on the hedonic benefits of spending money on
   doing rather than having, this paper investigates when people prefer to
   consume experiential and material purchases. We contend that the
   preferred timing of consumption tends to be more immediate for things
   (like clothing and gadgets) than for experiences (like vacations and
   meals out). First, we examine whether consumers exhibit a stronger
   preference to delay consumption of experiential purchases compared to
   material goods. When asked to make choices about their optimal
   consumption times, people exhibit a relative preference to have now and
   do later. In the next set of studies, we found that this difference in
   preferred consumption led participants to opt for a lesser material item
   now over a superior item later, but to wait for a superior experiential
   purchase rather than settle for a lesser experience now. This tendency
   is due to the fact that consumers derive more utility from waiting for
   experiences than from waiting for possessions. Finally, we provide
   evidence that these preferences affect people's real-world decisions
   about when to consume. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.

   consumers appreciate arrogant brands as reflecting high status and
   quality, arrogance can also make consumers feel inferior. Consumers
   whose self is a priori threatened may consequently "say no to the glow"
   and avoid arrogant brands. Results from six experiments using fictitious
   or actual arrogant brands show that when consumers experience prior self
   threat, they may avoid brands that convey arrogance in favor of a
   competing, less-arrogant alternative. Such avoidance helps
   self-threatened consumers restore their self-perceptions and feel better

AB Using a meta-analysis of 142 experimental observations, this work
   examines the influence of different research design and outcome measures
   on extremeness aversion (i.e., the propensity to avoid extreme options
   in choice situations). The results indicate that extremeness aversion is
   a robust phenomenon: middle options are significantly more often
   selected than other options. However, the strength of this behavioral
   effect exhibits substantial variation (up to three times the average
   magnitude) across methodological decisions: employing price-quality
   tradeoffs, nondurable categories, or binary-trinary choice-set
   comparisons tend to reduce the probability of extremeness aversion among
   consumers, whereas using a larger number of tradeoff dimensions,
   non-numeric attributes, high-quality extensions, or utilitarian products
   increase its likelihood. Because extremeness aversion has been assessed
   using three different measurement paradigms (absolute-share changes,
   relative-share shifts, and middle-option proportions), we discuss their
   characteristics and investigate their degree of agreement. We find that
   the three measures can lead to rather different effect magnitudes and
   even contradictory conclusions about the effect of moderators. (C) 2015

AB The present work examines the effectiveness of pairing a charitable
   donation with a product purchase. We propose a compensatory process, in
   which the guilt-laundering properties of charitable donations are more
   appealing the more consumption guilt is experienced. Consumption guilt
   is dependent on both product type (hedonic vs. utilitarian) and consumer
   characteristics (guilt-sensitivity), such that adding a charitable
   donation to hedonic products is more impactful than adding the same
   donation to utilitarian products, especially for guilt-sensitive
   consumers. As a result of the impact of product type and
   guilt-sensitivity, several non-intuitive findings emerge. For example,
   guilt-sensitive consumers, who normally indulge in hedonic consumption
   the least, indulge at least as much as their less guilt-sensitive
   counterparts when hedonic products are paired with a charitable
   donation. Moreover, guilt-sensitive consumers are relatively insensitive
   to the nature of the supported cause, indulging in hedonic consumption
   even when it supports disliked causes. Six studies demonstrate the
   impact of adding charitable donations to products as well as the unique
   role that consumption guilt and its alleviation play in the underlying
   process. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier

AB Conventional wisdom suggests that remembering our past successes or
   failures can help us make better decisions in the present. But how
   successful is this practice in the domain of self-control? Our work
   examines how the content of consumers' recollections (past self-control
   successes versus failures) and the subjective difficulty with which this
   content comes to mind (easily or with difficulty) jointly shape
   consumers' self-control decisions. When successes are easy to recall,
   people display more self-control than when they have difficulty
   recalling successes. However, recalling failures prompts indulgence
   regardless of its difficulty. We suggest that these differences in
   behavior may exist because recalling failures has substantially
   different affective and cognitive consequences than does recalling
   successes. Consistent with this theory, we demonstrate that external
   cues toward high or low self-certainty moderate the effects of recall on
   self-control. Taken together, this work enhances our understanding of
   self-control, self-perceptions, and metacognition. (C) 2015 Society for

AB In studies with adult participants, exposure to a prime that activates a
   stereotype can lead to stereotype-consistent behavior. Given significant
   differences in cognitive development, stereotype formation, and use of
   stereotypes from early childhood to adulthood, the emergence of such
   behavioral priming effects in childhood is uncertain. To begin
   addressing whether children exhibit behavioral priming effects from
   stereotype exposure, we conduct three experiments in which children are
   exposed to either a normal weight or overweight cartoon character prime,
   and subsequently (as an unrelated activity) have access to high energy,
   low-nutrient food. Our results with children from 6 to 14 years old
   indicate that overweight cartoon character primes can activate the
   overweight stereotype, leading to relatively high levels of food intake.
   This effect persisted when participants were simultaneously exposed to a
   normal weight and an overweight character together (study 2), and was
   successfully moderated by the activation of health knowledge (study 3).

   Three studies using different product and service failure scenarios
   demonstrate that consumers who have independent self-construals are more
   forgiving when the brand has no control over the transgression,
   regardless of brand-relationship strength. However, consumers who have
   interdependent self-construals are more forgiving when they have strong
   relationships with the transgressing brand, even if the brand is at

AB Attitudes about commitment can affect consumers' variety-seeking

   commitment mind-set in women and lead them to seek less variety. In this
   research, we explore whether short-term and long-term mating cues can
   likewise affect variety-seeking behavior in the product consumption
   domain through their influence on commitment attitude. In three
   experiments, we demonstrate that men's variety-seeking behavior
   increases in the presence of short-term but not long-term mating cues;
   conversely, women's variety-seeking behavior decreases in the presence
   of long-term but not short-term mating cues. These effects are caused by
   attitude toward commitment induced by mating cues. Past research
   concerning this topic has focused on one gender and on short-term mating
   cues only, but in this paper we provide a more complete picture and a
   more coherent theory of how, via influencing commitment attitude, mating
   cues affect variety seeking behavior differently in men than in women.

AB This article provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of
   religion on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future
   research at the intersection of these two topics. We delineate religion
   as a multidimensional construct and propose that religion affects
   consumer psychology and behavior through four dimensions beliefs,
   rituals, values, and community. For each dimension of religion, we offer
   definitions and measures, integrate previous findings from research in
   the psychology, consumer behavior, marketing, and religion literatures,
   and propose testable future research directions. With this conceptual
   framework and research agenda, we challenge consumer researchers to ask
   deeper questions about why religious affiliation and level of
   religiosity may be driving previously established differences in
   consumer behavior, and to uncover the psychological mechanisms
   underlying the effects. This framework complements and extends previous
   literature and provides a new delineated framework for considering
   research on the effects of religion on consumer behavior. (C) 2015

AB We propose mortality salience - increased accessibility of death-related
   thoughts - as one previously unexplored explanation for the annuity
   puzzle, the low rate at which retirees buy annuities even though
   economists recommend annuities as an optimal decision. Across four
   studies we show that mortality salience decreases how likely individuals
   are to put savings into an annuity. By forcing consumers to consider
   their own death, the annuity decision makes mortality salient,
   motivating them to avoid the annuity option as a proximal defense
   against the death-related thoughts triggered by considering an annuity.
   Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of the mortality salience effect
   through measurement and manipulation of the underlying process, and we
   estimate an overall mean effect size using meta-analysis. With this
   research, psychological theory can inform economic theory by helping to
   explain the annuity puzzle phenomenon that has challenged economists for
   decades. This research also has important implications for consumer
   welfare by offering insights into annuity choice and helping to inform
   the increasingly complex financial decisions facing individuals as they
   navigate the retirement savings decumulation process. (C) 2015 Society

   goal progress and goal construal is more likely to enhance
   self-regulation than non-fit. Our findings indicate that, compared with
   lesser perceived goal progress, greater perceived goal progress induces
   higher-level construals (studies la-2a). Moreover, as people perceive
   greater goal progress, abstract goal construal (i.e., "why") is more
   likely to promote goal-consistent behavior than concrete goal construal
   (i.e., "how"; studies 2a-2b). We also observed that this fit between

   has manifested. A meta-analytic synthesis of 104 question-behavior
   studies across 51 published and unpublished papers is presented.
   Grouping proposed theories for the effect into four overarching
   categories, we derive and test systematic predictions regarding
   potential moderators of conceptual and practical significance. Our
   findings provide varying degrees of support for four different
   theoretical mechanisms (attitudes, consistency, fluency and motivations)
   proposed to underlie the effect. Insights into these mechanisms are

AB There has been a remarkable increase in the use of spotlight analysis to
   examine any interactive effect between an independent variable and a
   continuous moderator. Most of the spotlight analyses have been conducted
   at one standard deviation above and below the mean value of the
   moderator, even when alternate methods are more appropriate.
   Additionally, many spotlight analyses are not conducted correctly. More
   importantly, results for spotlight analyses are reported in a manner
   that makes it virtually impossible for mistakes to be detected. This
   article focuses on "understanding," "conducting," and "reporting"
   spotlight analyses. By posing questions for the reader, it highlights
   some common mistakes made when doing spotlight analysis and explains why
   confusion often arises. Then it provides an easy to understand way to do
   spotlight analysis for some popular contexts. Alternatives to spotlight
   analysis are also briefly discussed. Finally, it suggests how to report
   results for spotlight analysis and for the alternatives. Pointing out
   recurrent mistakes should prevent perpetuation of misleading practices.
   Similarly, reporting essential details of the analyses should prevent
   mistakes from going undetected. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer

AB This research shows that consumers who willfully ignore ethical product
   attributes denigrate other, more ethical consumers who seek out and use
   this information in making purchase decisions. Across three studies,
   willfully ignorant consumers negatively judge ethical others they have
   never met across various disparate personality traits (e.g.,
   fashionable, boring). The denigration arises from the self-threat
   inherent in negative social comparison with others who acted ethically
   instead of choosing not to do so. In addition, this denigration has
   detrimental downstream consequences, undermining the denigrator's
   commitment to ethical values, as evidenced by reduced anger toward firms
   who violate the ethical principle in question and reduced intention to
   behave ethically in the future. There are two moderators of the effect:
   Denigration becomes less strong if willfully ignorant consumers have a
   second opportunity to act ethically after initially ignoring the ethical
   product information and also significantly weakens if initially ignoring
   the ethical attribute is seen as justifiable. These results have
   implications for understanding ethical consumption behavior, perceptions
   of ethical consumerism in general, and marketing of ethical products.

AB We examine consumers' forgetting to buy items they intended to buy. We
   show that the propensity to forget depends on the types of items
   consumers intend to purchase and the way consumers shop. Consumers may
   shop using a memory-based search by recalling their planned purchases
   from memory and directly searching for the products. For example,
   consumers may use the search function at an online store. Alternatively,
   consumers may use a stimulus-based search by systematically moving
   through a store, visually scanning the inventory and selecting the
   required items as they are encountered. Using an online shopping
   paradigm, we show that consumers are more likely to forget the items
   they infrequently buy when using the memory-based search, but not when
   using the stimulus-based search. In fact, when using the stimulus-based
   search, consumers are sometimes even better able to remember the items
   they infrequently (vs. frequently) buy. Moreover, consumers fail to take
   these factors into account when predicting their memory. As a result,
   they do not take appropriate actions to prevent forgetting (e.g., using
   a shopping list). (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB We show that consumers high in dialecticism-the tolerance of
   contradictions and the expectations of change (Peng & Nisbett,
   1999)-respond differently than low-dialecticism consumers to messages
   that have purely positive, mixed, or purely negative information. We
   find first that for low dialectics, felt ambivalence-and discomfort-is
   greater for mixed information messages than for negative or positive
   information. For high dialectics, however, mixed information leads to
   high felt ambivalence, but not to high discomfort. When given univalent
   positive or negative information messages, high dialectics have more
   thoughts about information opposite in valence to that presented, when
   presented with negative information messages. As a result, for high
   dialectics, univalent negative information produces the same high felt
   ambivalence, and even greater discomfort, than do mixed information
   messages. Through these non-parallel effects, we show that the
   relationship between felt ambivalence and discomfort is itself moderated
   by dialecticism. Through three experiments and using a novel
   manipulation of dialecticism, we replicate and generalize these effects

AB Consumers prefer products that deliver benefits for a longer time. For
   instance, caffeinated drinks are consumed for energy, but the key
   characteristic that performs this benefit-caffeine-tends to wear off in
   its effects. How can marketers communicate the lasting performance of
   product characteristics? This work proposes that numbers used in
   conveying product characteristics-round (200 mg) or precise (203
   mg)-influence consumers' perception of lasting performance and product
   attitudes. More specifically, product characteristics described in round
   (vs. precise) numbers are perceived as performing for a longer time, and
   this effect is driven by a symbolic association between round numbers
   and stability. This finding is important because numbers are commonly
   used in conveying product benefits and past work has mainly documented
   the advantages of using precise numbers (e.g., higher competence),
   whereas less is known about when and why using round numbers boosts
   product attitudes. Three studies, including one with actual consumption,
   offer triangulating evidence for this prediction and its underlying
   psychological mechanism. Overall, this work contributes to research on
   product perception, numerical cognition, and persuasion. (C) 2015

   perceive packages, and thus the claims they offer, as closer to the
   product than ads and their respective claims. This perception of greater
   claim-to-product proximity is likely to make a claim seem more
   verifiable. Therefore, claim-to-product proximity is taken as a signal
   of the marketers' credibility, decreasing inferences of manipulative
   intent and thereby increasing claim believability and purchase

AB Despite the frequency with which individuals compare themselves to a
   benchmark, little research has examined the implications of such
   comparisons on willingness to help others. Such comparisons can vary in
   direction by suggesting that one is doing better than a benchmark (a
   downward comparison) or worse than a benchmark (an upward comparison).
   We argue and find that by being relatively better off, people making
   downward comparisons are more likely to view giving as a means of
   expressing altruistic values (e.g., to give back and be a better person)
   compared to those making upward comparisons. Consequently, when the
   context highlights the instrumentality of giving for more altruistic
   reasons (to benefit others), they are more willing to give than are
   those making upward comparisons. Furthermore, this difference is
   mitigated when the context highlights the instrumentality of giving to
   benefit the self, and is reversed when the instrumentality of giving for
   benefitting others is challenged. We obtain support for this account
   across four studies, through both moderation and mediation, and across
   both monetary and nonmonetary comparison domains. (C) 2016 Society for

   characteristics and an individuals' motivational orientation. Across
   three studies, we find that individuals high in neuroticism experience
   greater self-control restoration when exposed to environmental cues
   associated with more anxiety while the reverse is true for individual
   who are low in neuroticism. Importantly, these results occur regardless
   of whether the environmental cues are inherent in urban consumer
   contexts, like a bookstore, or natural consumer contexts, like a safari
   vacation experience. We find preliminary process evidence that consumers
   low in neuroticism require fewer attentional resources when processing
   environmentally compatible cues, leading to self-control restoration.

AB Through a large-scale field study of 166,215 online restaurant reviews,
   we found evidence of a distance boosting effect, whereby experiencing
   spatial distance (i.e., authoring a review about a geographically
   distant restaurant, rather than proximate one) and temporal distance
   (i.e., authoring a review after a lengthy delay, rather than
   immediately) jointly affect review positivity by amplifying consumers'
   high-level construals. Although past research has explored the
   relationship between psychological distance, construal and consumer
   evaluation, the effects of various dimensions of distance have only been
   considered in isolation. Our research contributes to past work by
   testing the effects of experiencing two dimensions of psychological
   distance simultaneously on construal and consumer evaluations. Moreover,
   because our data contain naturalistic observations, our research
   includes a wide range of temporal and spatial-distances. We found that
   the effect of one distance increases the effect of the other.
   Metaphorically speaking, the effect of one distance is boosted by
   another. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier

AB The use of counterfeit versions of luxury brands is a growing
   phenomenon. Viewing their use by others may lead consumers to change
   their perceptions of the genuine brand. In several experiments, female
   participants viewed (or imagined) a female of varying social classes
   using a counterfeit or genuine product and were subsequently asked about
   the genuine luxury brand. While people were drawn toward the genuine
   brand more when in-groups than out-groups used counterfeits, asymmetries
   occurred. Higher classes denigrated the brand when lower (versus higher)
   classes used counterfeit brands, but lower classes did not denigrate
   when higher classes used them. A conceptual account, based on
   asymmetries of social hierarchies and greater uncertainty of counterfeit
   (than genuine) product benefits, was supported, with feelings of
   connection to the luxury brand as mediator. Asymmetric effects were
   reduced among consumers highly familiar with the genuine brand.
   Implications for marketing and protection from brand dilution are
   discussed. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Orienting a logo upward or downward may seem like an arbitrary graphic
   design decision, but we propose that it can have important implications
   for consumer judgments. In particular, we find across four experimental
   studies and a content analysis that diagonal direction can convey
   different levels of activity with upward or ascending diagonals
   conveying greater activity and effort than downward or descending
   diagonals. Consequently, when the context highlights the benefits of
   activity (vs. passivity), upward (vs. downward) diagonals lead to more
   favorable product judgments, greater product efficacy beliefs, and
   greater post-consumption satisfaction. Furthermore, we provide process
   evidence that perceived product efficacy beliefs mediate these effects,
   and that the effect is strongest when the object being visually oriented
   is text rather than images. These findings are particularly important in
   light of our content analysis findings that diagonal orientation is a
   relatively underutilized design feature. Collectively, our findings
   suggest that firms should use upward diagonals when the product context
   highlights a favorable view of activity. Otherwise, the firm should use
   downward diagonals, especially when the product context encourages
   consumers to view passivity favorably. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer

AB We investigate the impact of self-construal on extreme responding in six
   studies. The results show that people with an independent self-construal
   generally answer more extremely to survey items than those with an
   interdependent self-construal, especially when the items are self
   relevant (Studies la and 1b) and when these items are fluently processed
   (Study 3). Using an experimental causal chain design, this research also
   demonstrates that self-concept clarity drives the effect of
   self-construal on extreme responding. In particular, people with an
   independent self-construal have a higher level of self-concept clarity
   (Study 2a), and self-clarity leads to an extreme response style (Study
   2b). In Study 4, we demonstrate that the difference in extreme
   responding can partly explain a well-established self-construal effect,
   and we offer a solution to control for the bias in extreme responding in
   self-construal research. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB The effect of assortment size on purchase decisions is an ongoing
   subject of debate, in light of conflicting findings (Scheibehenne,
   Greifeneder, & Todd, 2010). The authors show that a key determinant of
   the effect is the order in which "whether to buy" and "which option to
   choose" decisions are made. Increasing assortment size has a more
   positive effect on the likelihood of consumers to make a purchase when
   the initial decision emphasis is on whether to make a purchase from a
   given set of options, as opposed to first identifying the best available
   option in the set. This prediction is based on the proposition that
   decision order determines how likely consumers are to make trade-offs
   between the perceived costs and benefits associated with a large product
   assortment, and that the benefits are given relatively greater weight
   when consumers decide first "whether to buy" (rather than "which option
   to choose"). Two incentive-compatible studies, using a systematic
   manipulation of assortment size and decision order, support the
   prediction. (C) 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Really new products (RNPs) defy classification within existing
   categories while challenging consumers' prior knowledge and thus are
   often difficult to fully appreciate. Using analogies to help consumers
   learn about novel features and benefits is one approach proposed in the
   new product literature. We examine the impact of revealing more stages
   of an analogy (access, mapping/transfer, and inference) and the
   proximity of the base domain of the analogy on evaluations of an RNP.
   When the base domain is similar to the new product, adding
   mapping/transfer information leads to more favorable evaluations, while
   adding the desired inference reduces evaluations. However, when the base
   domain is distant from the new product, revealing more information on
   the analogy leads to higher evaluations of RNPs. The enjoyment that
   arises from solving the analogy mediates the relationship between
   analogy completeness and product evaluations. (C) 2016 Society for

AB Consumers often touch products before reaching purchase decisions, and
   indeed touch improves evaluations of the given product. The present
   research investigates how touching a given product influences perception
   and choice of other seen products. We show that grasping a source
   product increases the visual fluency of a haptically similar product,
   thereby increasing the likelihood of choosing that product, but not the
   willingness to pay for it (Study 1). We also show that visually crowded
   rather than sparse product displays increase the effect of touch on
   choosing other haptically similar products, and that individuals'
   instrumental need for touch further modulates this effect (Study 2). Our
   results suggest that by manipulating or mimicking the haptic features
   (e.g., shape and size) of objects that consumers grasp while shopping,
   marketers can develop packaging that facilitates consumers' visual
   processing of their products, thereby increasing choice of those
   products. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Recent work demonstrates that narratives persuade via mechanisms
   distinct from other persuasive message formats. The present work draws
   from the discourse processing and communication literature to introduce
   a construct of retrospective reflection as an additional mediator in
   narrative persuasion. Retrospective reflection represents self or
   other-relevant memories evoked by transportation into a story, which
   corroborates and extends story-implied beliefs into the reader's world.
   The reported studies indicate that retrospective reflection is distinct
   from transportation, mediates the relationship between transportation
   and various persuasion-related outcomes, and predicts these outcomes
   beyond transportation. The current work also examines the influence of
   personal relevance (Study 2) and cognitive load (Study 3) to better
   understand the role of retrospective reflection in narrative persuasion.

AB This paper examines how the type of background music (vocal vs.
   instrumental) affects consumers' cognitive performance depending on
   individual differences in executive attention (i.e., working memory
   capacity). Across three experiments, we find that vocal music leads to
   poorer cognitive and attitudinal outcomes for consumers lower in working
   memory capacity but does not affect those higher in working memory
   capacity. However, short-term habituation to background music helps
   mitigate this negative effect of vocal music on consumer ad recall.
   Finally, consumer performances on computing discount prices are also
   affected by music type depending upon whether prices are communicated in
   verbal or numeric form. Overall, this research lays out an
   executive-attention based process mechanism explaining when and how
   background music shapes consumer learning and memory. The outlined
   theory enriches the literature on music effects as well as
   immediate-term learning by explicating the role of selective attention
   in the processing of multi-modal marketing stimuli. (C) 2016 Society for

AB Consumer psychology has been overly reliant on a small set of paradigms.
   As a result, the field appears less prepared than it could aspire to be
   for contributing new knowledge on, and relief from, our
   hyper-consumption era. Accordingly, I explore Buddhist psychology by
   drawing from its foundational framework known as the Three Marks of
   Existence (suffering,imperinanence, and no-self) to introduce an Eastern
   theory of mind and provide alternative guidance on research for consumer
   well-being. The THE framework offers an opportunity to re-think the
   priorities, nature, and processes of the comparing and judging consumer
   mind (e.g., expectations, preferences, satisfaction); the attaching and
   depending consumer mind (e.g., ownership, materialism, excessive
   behaviors); and the deciding, choosing, and regulating consumer mind
   (marketplace morality, cognitive biases, values-based choice, and free
   will). From these considerations I generate research questions and
   summarizing propositions for future research. The closing discussion
   synopsizes the contributions and limitations, including extra
   opportunities for integrating Buddhist and consumer psychologies. (C)

   for trust and cooperation. We find that strangers who are assigned to
   eat similar (vs. dissimilar) foods are more trusting of each other in a
   trust game (Study 1). Food consumption further influences conflict
   resolution, with strangers who are assigned to eat similar foods
   cooperating more in a labor negotiation, and therefore earning more
   money (Study 2). The role of incidental food similarity on increased
   trust extends to the product domain. Consumers are more trusting of
   information about non-food products (e.g., a software product) when the
   advertiser in the product testimonial eats similar food to them (Study
   3). Lastly, we find evidence that food serves as a particularly strong
   cue of trust compared with other incidental similarity. People perceive
   that pairs eating similar foods, but not pairs wearing similar colored
   shirts, are more trusting of one another (Study 4). We discuss
   theoretical and practical implications of this work for improving

AB Three studies were conducted to examine how embarrassment influences
   consumer preferences for brand conspicuousness. We predict that
   consumers with different levels of self-esteem will have distinct coping
   strategies when they feel embarrassed, resulting in differences in their
   preference changes related to brand conspicuousness. The results show
   that when feeling embarrassed, consumers with low self-esteem (high
   self-esteem) are more likely to have increased motivation to avoid
   social attention to the self in general (to repair their self-image).
   Thus, relatively speaking, consumers with low self-esteem (high
   self-esteem) prefer a more conspicuous product design over a less
   conspicuous one to a lesser (greater) extent when they are embarrassed
   than when they are not embarrassed. In addition, we demonstrate that the

   consumers form a strong connection with the brand. (C) 2016 Society for
