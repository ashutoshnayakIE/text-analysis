AB Many papers in the mutual fund literature rely on a sample that matches
   the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) mutual fund database
   with the fund holdings data from Thomson Reuters (TR) s12 database. I
   document that about 58% of newly founded U.S. equity mutual fund share
   classes in the CRSP mutual fund database from 2008 to 2015 cannot be
   matched to the TR database. Funds that are missing from the TR database
   tend to be smaller, have higher turnover ratios, receive higher fund
   flows, and have higher four-factor alphas. These differences are robust
   within same cohorts of funds. Index funds and exchange-traded funds are
   more likely to be omitted than actively managed funds.

AB Takeover bidders in stock-for-stock mergers have strong incentives to
   increase their own premerger stock prices to lower their acquisition
   costs. We find that before announcements of stock mergers, bidders
   manage down analyst earnings forecasts prior to earnings releases. Such
   expectation management benefits bidders by increasing their own stock
   prices and saving on acquisition costs. Additionally, analysts who have
   close relations with stock bidders are more likely to participate in
   expectation management. For identification, we use an instrumental
   variable analysis, a pseudo-event analysis, and a propensity
   score-matching approach. Our paper provides evidence on expectation
   management as a previously underexplored opportunistic behavior by
   takeover bidders.

AB The underrepresentation of minorities in cultural industries is a widely
   publicized problem with far-reaching economic and social significance.
   It is also one of many industries in which employers suggest that the
   locus of bias is not within the organization but with the consumer. The
   empirical challenge of relating consumer behavior to employee
   composition has constrained prior efforts to test their claim and to
   test the theory of consumer discrimination more broadly. As a result,
   employers have gradually expanded the scope of the customer
   discrimination theory from one rooted in direct interaction to include
   an aversion to simply seeing employees of a different ethnicity. We
   explore how consumers respond to employee composition by evaluating the
   performance of films released in the United States as a function of the
   racial diversity of their cast. We find that films with a single black
   actor do not differ from those with zero black actors, and that films
   with multiple black actors in the principal cast actually achieve
   significantly higher domestic box-office revenues than either. To
   distinguish between competing explanations for this result, we conduct a
   vignette-based experiment that allows us to identify a positive
   influence of diversity on consumers' assessments of quality, controlling
   for differences in film or actor appeal. Collectively, these results
   help discredit one rationale for unequal hiring in cultural industries
   and also suggest an important qualification to the theory of consumer
   discrimination: in settings where employee race is visible but the
   consumer is physically distant, diversity is more profitable than
   costly.

   expected-pay-effort sensitivity, which determines actual incentives, and
   pay-performance sensitivity, which is the ratio of expected-pay-effort
   to performance-effort sensitivity. An increase in growth option
   intensity can increase performance-effort sensitivity more than
   expected-pay-effort sensitivity so that, as incentives increase,
   pay-performance sensitivity decreases. We document empirical evidence
   consistent with this finding. Pay-performance sensitivity, measured by
   dollar changes in manager wealth over dollar changes in firm value,
   decreases with proxies for growth option intensity and increases with
   proxies for growth option exercise.

AB We examine whether family firms invest more in employee relations than
   non-family firms. Using the variation in state-level changes in
   inheritance, gift, and estate taxes as an exogenous shock to family
   control, we find that family firms, particularly those in which a
   founder serves as chief executive officer or those in which a family
   member serves as a director on the board, treat their employees better
   than nonfamily firms. More importantly, family firms focus on investing
   in employee relations that help alleviate laborrelated conflicts and
   controversies, possibly to avoid a negative family reputation among
   stakeholders. Family firms' better treatment of their employees is also
   evident when we use a difference-in-difference test to exploit changes
   in family firm status due to (sudden) deaths of family members and
   firms' inclusion in Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work For" list to
   identify employee-friendly treatment. We further find that family firms
   in the early stage of their life cycle invest more in employee relations
   when they operate in labor-intensive industries in which the benefits
   from family owners' monitoring of employees are expected to be large.
   Moreover, we find that although nonfamily firms' investment in employee
   relations is impeded by several constraints, such as short-term investor
   pressure, managerial myopia, and managerial agency problems, family
   firms do not suffer from such constraints. These findings help explain
   why underinvestment in employee relations is prevalent in public firms
   despite potential long-termbenefits from such intangible investment.

   using eigenvector centrality, we use matching methods and instrumental
   variables to show that startup CEO replacement occurs more often and
   faster when prominent VCs participate. We further explore these VCs'
   comparative advantage in managing CEO turnover, finding that the
   prominent VC effects increase as replacement costs rise, such as when
   incumbent CEOs are entrenched or possess specialized technology
   know-how, or when startups are in an early stage. When prominent VCs
   participate, replacement CEOs are disproportionately experienced
   outsiders-external hires who possess prior startup CEO experience. Our
   results reveal that CEO turnover is associated with increases in
   startups' ex post innovation and survival performance, with experienced
   outsider CEO replacements showing the strongest survival rates.

AB Because mothers remain disproportionately responsible for childcare, the
   daily requirement for physical presence at work disadvantages them
   compared with otherwise equivalent men and childless women. Relaxing
   this requirement may therefore enhance the well-being and productivity
   of working mothers. I tested this idea with a randomized field
   experiment, using a within-subjects analysis from a repeated crossover
   design. The 187 participants in the experiment, which ran for four weeks
   and yielded 748 person-week observations, revealed a preference for
   about two remote working days per week. I observed no significant
   differences in the uptake of remote working days between men, women,
   parents, nonparents, fathers, and mothers. Mothers reported meaningfully
   reduced family-work conflict during remote working weeks, but fathers
   did not. Remote working generally increased job performance, but the
   effect was greatest for mothers. The coordination costs of remote
   working, with respect to coworker helping and job interdependence, did
   not appear prohibitive. Interviews with study participants corroborate
   and contextualize these findings.

AB In the classical secretary problem, one attempts to find the maximum of
   an unknown and unlearnable distribution through sequential search. In
   many real-world searches, however, distributions are not entirely
   unknown and can be learned through experience. To investigate learning
   in such settings, we conduct a large-scale behavioral experiment in
   which people search repeatedly from fixed distributions in a "repeated
   secretary problem." In contrast to prior investigations that find no
   evidence for learning in the classical scenario, in the repeated setting
   we observe substantial learning resulting in near-optimal stopping
   behavior. We conduct a Bayesian comparison of multiple behavioral
   models, which shows that participants' behavior is best described by a
   class of threshold-based models that contains the theoretically optimal
   strategy. Fitting such a threshold-based model to data reveals players'
   estimated thresholds to be close to the optimal thresholds after only a
   small number of games.

   validate theoretical results that collaborative group structures may
   search more effectively in problems of low complexity but are
   outperformed by nominal structures at higher complexity levels. We call
   into question the dominance of the nominal group technique. Further
   close examination of search strategies reveals important insights: the
   number of generated solutions, a typical proxy for good problem-solving
   performance, does not consistently drive performance benefits across
   different levels of problem complexity. The average distance of search
   steps and the problem space coverage also play critical roles. Moreover,
   their effect is contingent on complexity: a wider variety of solutions
   is helpful only in complex problems. Overall, we caution management
   about the limitations of generic, albeit common, rules of thumb, such as
   "generate as many ideas as possible."

AB This paper examines how sentiment affects homebuyers' housing
   transaction decisions with a focus on auction sales. Utilizing housing
   transaction data in Sydney from 2000 to 2014, we find that transaction
   prices are significantly higher for auction sales compared with private
   sales, consistent with the notion of a "winner's curse." Four sentiment
   proxies, including three weather-based sentiment proxies and a
   survey-based sentiment index, are used to derive novel measures of
   sentiment, revealing that higher sentiment is associated with higher
   transaction prices, particularly for auction sales. Moreover, sentiment
   boosts sale prices particularly when the housing market is in boom;
   however, investors are not more prone to sentiment bias than are
   owner-occupiers. Sentiment exhibits an asymmetric effect in that low
   sentiment dampens price to a greater extent compared with the
   price-boosting effect of high sentiment. Our result is robust to using
   national sport events as sentiment shocks, selection bias, and
   participation constraints. Potential mechanisms include present-biased
   preferences and sentiment-related projection bias. Overall, our evidence
   sheds light on the role of sentiment in housing market decisions.

AB Celebrity endorsers can cause negative publicity that can spill over to
   the endorsed brand. However, little is known about the economic effects
   of firm reactions to these events. This study fills this gap and
   estimates how announcements of firms' reactions (yes versus no), timing
   (slow versus fast), and type (maintain/suspend versus no reaction)
   affect daily abnormal stock returns (ARs) following negative publicity.
   Using 128 events of negative endorser publicity between 1988 and 2016
   affecting firms in 230 cases, this study offers new and economically
   relevant insights. The most surprising finding is that firms can gain
   value depending on their response. Announcements of firms' reactions
   positively affect ARs, especially if they occur quickly after negative
   publicity surfaces. The analyses reveal that fast (slow) announcements
   of firms' reactions increase (decrease) firm value by 2.10% (-1.88%)
   over the next four trading weeks. Results also show that issuing
   statements suspending or maintaining the endorser both yield more
   positive ARs than not reacting at all. Further analyses identify
   conditions under which the stock market rewards maintaining or
   suspending an endorser. Firms have more positive ARs when they (1)
   suspend higher-blame endorsers, (2) suspend endorsers whose negative
   publicity is related to their occupation, (3) maintain endorsers with a
   high product fit, and (4) do not suspend apologetic endorsers. This
   study discusses implications for theory and practice and provides a
   strong empirical foundation for understanding the consequences of firm
   reaction announcements to negative celebrity endorser publicity.

AB Many of the activities performed in firms are done by teams, where a
   common output is observed, but outsiders cannot observe the individual
   contributions of each team member. This leads to the possibility of some
   of the members of the team free-riding on the contributions of others.
   Repeated interactions of a team can then potentially lead to cooperation
   among the members of the team under the credible threat of returning to
   a free-riding equilibrium. However, repeated interaction under
   cooperation of a team may lead to decreasing overall output over time
   because the benefits of the team working together may exogenously
   decrease over time. This then leads to the optimal duration of a team
   being finite but stochastic, creating inefficiency, but being
   sufficiently long so that the elements of the team have an incentive to
   cooperate. This provides a theory of successive team formation and
   termination in a firm. The possibility for a too long duration for full
   team cooperation may then lead the firm to reduce the extent of team
   cooperation, to be able to reduce the expected duration of a team, and
   have fewer losses of the team lasting for too long.

AB Despite their idiosyncrasies, motor and cognitive learning and endurance
   sports training have in common that they involve repeated practice.
   While considerable research has been devoted to the effect of practice
   on performance, little is known about optimal practice strategies. In
   this paper, we model the practice process for both skill acquisition and
   retention, and optimize its profile to maximize performance on a
   predefined date. For skill acquisition, we find that the optimal process
   involves multiple phases of practice increase and decrease, yielding
   U-shaped effort consistent with the principle of distributing practice,
   and that the transitions between phases are smoother for skills that are
   easily forgotten (e.g., cognitive skills) than for those that are easily
   retained (e.g., continuous motor skills). In particular for the latter,
   an extended period of rest should precede an ultimate high-intensity
   stress. For skill retention, the optimal practice strategy consists of
   cycles of either constant effort (for skills that are easily forgotten)
   or pulsed effort (for skills that are easily retained) consistent with
   the principle of alternating stress and rest. Our parametric model thus
   indicates when commonly used high-performance practice strategies are
   indeed optimal.

AB A key strategic decision for platforms is the extent to which they
   should facilitate the entry of untested new products and sellers
   alongside established products and sellers. Exploration by current
   buyers helps future buyers better value these products and sellers. This
   externality across buyers raises the possibility that there may be too
   little exploration from the platform's perspective. On the other hand,
   when sellers have market power and so price strategically, and platforms
   extract a share of seller revenue (i.e., charge commissions), the
   direction of any such bias is not obvious. We provide a theory that
   predicts when the platform will prefer more, less, or the same level of
   exploration as that induced by sellers in equilibrium. Our theory can
   explain why platforms will sometimes have no incentive to steer buyers

AB Approximate linear programs (ALPs) are well-known models for computing
   value function approximations (VFAs) of intractable Markov decision
   processes (MDPs). VFAs from ALPs have desirable theoretical properties,
   define an operating policy, and provide a lower bound on the optimal
   policy cost. However, solving ALPs near-optimally remains challenging,
   for example, when approximating MDPs with nonlinear cost functions and
   transition dynamics or when rich basis functions are required to obtain
   a good VFA. We address this tension between theory and solvability by
   proposing a convex saddle-point reformulation of an ALP that includes as
   primal and dual variables, respectively, a vector of basis function
   weights and a constraint violation density function over the
   state-action space. To solve this reformulation, we develop a proximal
   stochastic mirror descent (PSMD) method that learns regions of high ALP
   constraint violation via its dual update. We establish that PSMD returns
   a near-optimal ALP solution and a lower bound on the optimal policy cost
   in a finite number of iterations with high probability. We numerically
   compare PSMD with several benchmarks on inventory control and energy
   storage applications. We find that the PSMD lower bound is tighter than
   a perfect information bound. In contrast, the constraint-sampling
   approach to solve ALPs may not provide a lower bound, and applying row
   generation to tackle ALPs is not computationally viable. PSMD policies
   outperform problem-specific heuristics and are comparable or better than
   the policies obtained using constraint sampling. Overall, our ALP
   reformulation and solution approach broadens the applicability of
   approximate linear programming.

AB I study the impact of government spending on corporate innovation. Using
   changes in U.S. Senate committee chairmanships as a source of exogenous
   variation in state-level federal government expenditures, I find that
   firms headquartered in states with increases in government spending
   significantly reduce their innovation output, as measured by their
   number of patents and the citations to these patents. These reductions
   are mostly concentrated in labor-intensive industries, in firms
   headquartered in states with lower unemployment rates, and in
   government-dependent industries. My findings suggest that resource
   diversion induced by increased government spending is a channel through
   which government spending may affect corporate innovation.

   that is a simple modification of three-pass regression filter/ partial
   least squares regression with an opposite property: the predictability
   tests applied to the combined predictor become more conservative in the
   presence of p-hacking. Using simulations, we quantify the advantages of
   our approach relative to the standard information-aggregation
   techniques. We also apply our aggregation technique to three sets of

   forecasting ability of combined predictors in two cases cannot be
   explained by p-hacking.

AB We study a rebate program in the credit card industry where the firm
   automatically processed the rebate earned by consumers with flexible and
   effortless redemption opportunities in future transactions. Contrary to
   what the normative economic theory would predict, we document that
   consumers frequently failed to redeem their rebate. Given this
   observation, we examine what may have been the primary driving force
   behind this pattern and the implications for the firm. We provide
   evidence that the phenomenon that we observe in our study is a result of
   cardholders being influenced by the way their outcomes were framed. We
   find that redemption incidences coincide with episodes where rebates are
   a larger portion of the amount spent. On the basis of the empirical
   regularities, we formulate a model of cardholder behavior where the
   cardholder experiences increasing psychological utility when rebate
   redemption yields a deeper discount. The model estimates indicate that,
   although delayed redemption left customers monetarily worse off in each
   transaction (cardholders passed up on average $0.76 of card-level
   benefits to experience greater psychological utility), once the
   psychological utility is taken into account, customers were shown to
   fare better overall. For the firm, in addition to the card benefits that
   were passed up, the psychological utility generated an additional
   average benefit of $1.21 per redemption. Finally, through
   counterfactuals we show that carefully designing a rebate program that
   takes into account consumers' psychological redemption utility can
   further benefit both consumers and firms.

   pictures. A network of 4,445 movies is constructed to indicate which
   movies are similar. I first examine the properties of the network using
   descriptive and regression analysis; then I develop a model of network
   formation for counterfactual analysis. It is found that most movies
   imitate and evolve around a "core" of the more successful movies. In
   addition, imitation is both conventional and atypical: a new movie
   usually follows a stream of similar movies yet simultaneously combines
   atypical elements from movies outside this stream. This atypicality, if
   well balanced, has a positive effect on the individual movie's box
   office. However, I find that, in the long run, atypical combination may
   lead to a worse collective box-office performance because of the way it
   changes the market structure.

AB We examine whether the recognition versus disclosure of identical
   accounting information affects the credit rating process and ultimately
   corporate credit ratings. The primary input into corporate credit
   ratings is adjusted financial statements, which the rating agencies
   create by modifying reported financial statements to reflect
   credit-relevant items not recognized under U.S. Generally Accepted
   Accounting Principles. The rating agencies have claimed that this
   process means that accounting changes that move previously disclosed
   information onto firms' financial statements have virtually no effect on
   firms' adjusted financial statements or their credit ratings. We show
   that this claim is incorrect using the implementation of Financial
   Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 158 (SFAS158). This standard
   did not prescribe any new financial information. Rather, it simply
   required the balance sheet recognition of a previously disclosed item.
   We find that firms recognizing an additional pension liability due to
   SFAS158 had lower leverage on the rating agency adjusted financial
   statements and received higher corporate credit ratings. This
   counterintuitive result occurs because the rating agency adjustments
   made before SFAS158 were punitive relative to the combination of the
   SFAS158 changes and the rating agency adjustments made after SFAS158.
   The difference in rating agency adjustments before and after SFAS158 was
   primarily due to rating agency adjustments in the preSFAS158 period that
   did not account for minimum liability adjustments, an aspect of pension
   accounting eliminated by SFAS158. Overall, our results indicate that
   SFAS158 generated real changes in rating agency adjustments and that
   these changes had real consequences for firms' credit ratings.

AB We investigate the effect of auditing on promoting exports for private
   firms in emerging markets. Using a sample of private firms from 125
   countries between 2006 and 2015, we show that firms that have their
   financial statements audited have more exports than firms that do not
   have their financial statements audited. To infer causality, we employ a
   regression discontinuity design (RDD). Using the discontinuity around
   the mandatory financial audit threshold, we find that firms slightly
   above the threshold have more exports than do firms that are slightly
   below the threshold. We also exploit the countries with exogenous
   regulation shocks to the mandatory audits. Using the
   difference-in-differences (DiD) design, we find that firms that are
   exempted from mandatory audits have less exports subsequent to the
   regulation change. Further analyses reveal that the effect of auditing
   is more pronounced in countries with higher audit quality and for firms
   with limited alternative information. Our findings suggest that the
   auditing function promotes exports-an important economic consequence for
   the global economic development.

AB Recent studies document the increasing effectiveness of shareholder
   voting as a monitoring mechanism. Because both directors and the market
   respond to shareholder votes, management has stronger incentives to
   influence voting outcomes. We identify one channel through which
   management can affect voting outcomes: increasing the turnout of
   (typically management-friendly) retail shareholders. Our study focuses
   on an observable managerial choice of how to deliver proxy materials to
   maximize retail turnout. Management can opt to send a full set of proxy
   materials to all shareholders, which increases retail turnout but also
   increases printing and mailing costs, or they can send a notice
   directing shareholders to proxy materials available online, which
   reduces costs but also decreases retail turnout. We find that managers
   are more likely to choose to deliver a full set of proxy materials when
   there are contentious items on the ballot for which they need additional
   voting support; and, indeed, the resulting support increases the
   likelihood that voting outcomes will align with management
   recommendations.

AB We develop a model in which reward-based crowdfunding enables firms to

   learn about total demand from a limited sample of target consumers
   preordering a new product. Learning from the crowdfunding sample creates
   a valuable real option because firms invest only if updated expectations
   about total demand are sufficiently high. This is particularly valuable
   for firms facing a high degree of uncertainty about consumer
   preferences, such as developers of innovative consumer products.
   Learning also enables firms to overcome moral hazard. The higher the
   funds raised, the lower the firms' incentives to divert them, provided
   third-party platforms limit the sample size by restricting campaign
   length. Although the probability of campaign success decreases with

AB Just as employers face uncertainty when hiring workers, workers also
   face uncertainty when accepting employment, and bad employers may
   opportunistically depart from expectations, norms, and laws. However,
   prior research in economics and information sciences has focused sharply
   on the employer's problem of identifying good workers rather than vice
   versa. This issue is especially pronounced in markets for gig work,
   including online labor markets, in which platforms are developing
   strategies to help workers identify good employers. We build a
   theoretical model for the value of such reputation systems and test its
   predictions on Amazon Mechanical Turk, on which employers may decline to
   pay workers while keeping their work product and workers protect
   themselves using third-party reputation systems, such as Turkopticon. We
   find that (1) in an experiment on worker arrival, a good reputation
   allows employers to operate more quickly and on a larger scale without
   loss to quality; (2) in an experimental audit of employers, working for
   good-reputation employers pays 40% higher effective wages because of
   faster completion times and lower likelihoods of rejection; and (3)
   exploiting reputation system crashes, the reputation system is
   particularly important to small, good-reputation employers, which rely
   on the reputation system to compete for workers against more established
   employers. This is the first clean field evidence of the effects of
   employer reputation in any labor market and is suggestive of the special
   role that reputation-diffusing technologies can play in promoting gig
   work, in which conventional labor and contract laws are weak.

AB In the wake of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, social-media
   platforms are facing increasing pressure to combat the propagation of
   "fake news" (i.e., articles whose content is fabricated). Motivated by
   recent attempts in this direction, we consider the problem faced by a
   social-media platform that is observing the sharing actions of a
   sequence of rational agents and is dynamically choosing whether to
   conduct an inspection (i.e., a "fact-check") of an article whose
   validity is ex ante unknown. We first characterize the agents'
   inspection and sharing actions and establish that, in the absence of any
   platform intervention, the agents' news-sharing process is prone to the
   proliferation of fabricated content, even when the agents are intent on
   sharing only truthful news. We then study the platform's inspection
   problem. We find that because the optimal policy is adapted to
   crowdsource inspection from the agents, it exhibits features that may
   appear a priori nonobvious; most notably, we show that the optimal
   inspection policy is nonmonotone in the ex ante probability that the
   article being shared is fake. We also investigate the effectiveness of
   the platform's policy in mitigating the detrimental impact of fake news
   on the agents' learning environment. We demonstrate that in environments
   characterized by a low (high) prevalence of fake news, the platform's
   policy is more effective when the rewards it collects from content
   sharing are low relative to the penalties it incurs from the sharing of
   fake news (when the rewards it collects from content sharing are high in
   absolute terms).

AB When will a large group provide an accurate answer to a question
   involving quantity estimation? We empirically examine this question on a
   crowd-based corporate earnings forecast platform (Estimize.com). By
   tracking user activities, we monitor the amount of public information a
   user views before making an earnings forecast. We find that the more
   public information users view, the less weight they put on their own
   private information. Although this improves the accuracy of individual
   forecasts, it reduces the accuracy of the group consensus forecast
   because useful private information is prevented from entering the
   consensus. To address endogeneity concerns related to a user's
   information acquisition choice, we collaborate with Estimize.com to run
   experiments that restrict the information available to randomly selected
   stocks and users. The experiments confirm that "independent" forecasts
   result in a more accurate consensus. Estimize.com was convinced to
   switch to a "blind" platform from November 2015 on. The findings suggest
   that the wisdom of crowds can be better harnessed by encouraging
   independent voices from among group members and that more public
   information disclosure may not always improve group decision making.

   achieved by formal or relational contracts alone. Our empirics consider
   revenue-sharing contracts between movie distributors and an exhibitor.
   The exhibitor has discretion about whether and when to show a movie, and
   the parties frequently renegotiate formal contracts after a movie has
   finished its run. We document that such ex post renegotiation is
   consistent with the distributor rewarding the exhibitor for adaptation
   decisions that improve their joint payoffs.

AB A growing number of firms use incentive programs to encourage healthy
   behaviors, but there is little evidence about how such incentives should
   be structured over time. We explore this issue using a large field
   experiment that incentivized employees of a Fortune 500 company to use
   their workplace gym. We compare the effectiveness of a treatment with
   constant incentives over 8 weeks to two treatments that varied
   incentives over time. One variable treatment featured front-loaded
   incentives, which could, in theory, help procrastinators overcome
   startup costs to joining an incentive program. We find, however, that
   the front-loaded incentive did not increase participation on the
   extensive margin relative to the constant incentive and was less
   effective in sustaining exercise over time. The second variable
   incentive was designed to leverage short-term habit formation by turning
   incentives on and off over a longer period of time. This novel sporadic
   incentive showed slightly stronger effects than the constant incentive.
   We discuss how the nature of habit-formation processes affects the
   relative benefits of consistent versus periodic incentives.

   competition effects of retail colocation. Search frictions generate an
   average of $333 per car in dealer markups. Agglomeration implies that
   dealer closures could harm incumbent colocated dealers, even though the

   global financing conditions to issue U.S. dollar bonds and build cash
   balances are also those whose share price is most vulnerable to local
   currency depreciation. In particular, firms' vulnerability to currency
   depreciation derives less from the foreign currency debt as such, and
   more from the cash balances that are built up by using foreign currency
   debt. Overall, our results point to a financial motive for dollar bond
   issuance by emerging market firms in carry trade-like transactions that
   leave them vulnerable in an environment of dollar strength.

AB We consider a periodic-review, single-product inventory system with lost
   sales and positive lead times under censored demand. In contrast to the
   classical inventory literature, we assume the firm does not know the
   demand distribution a priori and makes an adaptive inventory-ordering
   decision in each period based only on the past sales (censored demand)
   data. The standard performance measure is regret, which is the cost
   difference between a learning algorithm and the clairvoyant
   (full-information) benchmark. When the benchmark is chosen to be the
   (full-information) optimal base-stock policy, Huh et al. [Huh WT,
   Janakiraman G, Muckstadt JA, Rusmevichientong P (2009a) An adaptive
   algorithm for finding the optimal base-stock policy in lost sales
   inventory systems with censored demand. Math. Oper. Res. 34(2):397-416.]
   developed a nonparametric learning algorithm with a cubic-root
   convergence rate on regret. An important open question is whether there
   exists a nonparametric learning algorithm whose regret rate matches the
   theoretical lower bound of any learning algorithms. In this work, we
   provide an affirmative answer to this question. More precisely, we
   propose a new nonparametric algorithm termed the simulated cycle-update
   policy and establish a square-root convergence rate on regret, which is
   proven to be the lower bound of any learning algorithm. Our algorithm
   uses a random cycle-updating rule based on an auxiliary simulated system
   running in parallel and also involves two new concepts, namely the
   withheld on-hand inventory and the double-phase cycle gradient
   estimation. The techniques developed are effective for learning a
   stochastic system with complex system dynamics and lasting impact of
   decisions.

   arising from what we call default ambiguity-that is, a situation where
   it is impossible to decide which banks are in default. Specifically, we
   study the clearing problem: given a network of banks interconnected by
   financial contracts, determine which banks are in default and what
   percentage of their liabilities they can pay. Prior work has shown that
   when banks can only enter into debt contracts with each other, this
   problem always has a unique maximal solution. We first prove that when
   banks can also enter into credit default swaps (CDSs), the clearing
   problem may have no solution or multiple conflicting solutions, thus
   leading to default ambiguity. We then derive sufficient conditions on
   the network structure to eliminate these issues. Finally, we discuss
   policy implications for the CDS market.

AB In uncertain environments, project reviews provide an opportunity to
   make "continue or abandon" decisions and thereby maximize a project's
   expected payoff. We experimentally investigate continue/abandon
   decisions in a multistage project under two conditions: when the project
   is reviewed at every stage and when review opportunities are limited.
   Our results confirm findings in the literature that project abandonment
   tends to be delayed; yet, we also observe premature termination.
   Decisions are highly path dependent; in particular, subjects are more
   likely to abandon after observing reduced project value, and abandonment
   rate is higher near the middle-rather than near the beginning or end-of
   a project. Interestingly, when reviews are limited, subjects are less
   likely to continue a project that should be abandoned. At the same time,
   subjects are more inclined to review again after receiving negative
   (rather than positive) news. Our data are explained well by a model that
   incorporates three behavioral concepts-gains or losses from comparing
   the project value with an internal adaptive reference point, sunk cost
   bias, and status quo bias. Our work suggests that more frequent reviews
   need not lead to better project performance, and it also identifies
   contexts in which outside intervention is most valuable in project
   decision making.

AB We examine the relationship between data analytics capabilities and

   first utilize a survey to capture two types of firm practices, process
   improvement and new technology development for 331 firms. We then use
   patent data to further analyze new technology development for a broader
   sample of more than 2,000 publicly traded firms. We find that data
   analytics capabilities are more likely to be present and are more
   valuable in firms that are oriented around process improvement and that
   create new technologies by combining a diverse set of existing
   technologies than they are in firms that are focused on generating
   entirely new technologies. These results are consistent with the theory
   that data analytics are complementary to certain types of innovation
   because they enable firms to expand the search space of existing
   knowledge to combine into new technologies, as well as the theoretical
   arguments that data analytics support incremental process improvements.
   Data analytics appears less effective for developing entirely new
   technologies or creating combinations involving a few areas of
   knowledge, innovative approaches where there is either limited data or
   limited value in integrating diverse knowledge. Overall, our results
   suggest that firms that have historically focused on specific types of
   innovation-process innovation and innovation by diverse
   recombination-may receive the most benefit; from using data analytics.

AB The United States is in the midst of a drug overdose epidemic. Although
   the online availability of drugs has been a growing concern with
   considerable speculation that digital platforms are contributing to this
   epidemic, empirical assessments have been lacking. To quantify this
   impact, we rely on the phased rollout of Craigslist, a major online
   platform, as an experimental setup. Applying a difference-in-differences
   approach on a national panel data set for all counties in the United
   States from 1997 to 2008, we find a 14.9% increase in drug abuse
   treatment admissions, a 5.7% increase in drug abuse violations, and a
   6.0% increase in drug overdose deaths after Craigslist's entry. The
   impacts of Craigslist's entry are larger among women, whites, Asians,
   and the more educated. Further, the unintended consequences of
   Craigslist are more likely to accrue in larger, wealthier areas with
   initially low levels of drug abuse. These findings raise the possibility
   that the marked growth in U.S. drug abuse may have partially stemmed
   from the wider availability of illicit drugs online at the very
   beginning of its evolution.

AB Prior work has established that the financing environment can impact
   firm strategy. We argue that this influence can shape the earliest
   strategic choices of a new venture by creating a potential trade-off
   between two objectives: rapid growth and reaping the benefits of a
   positive reputation (glory). We leverage a simple reputation-building
   strategic choice-naming the firm after the founder (eponymy)-that is
   associated with superior profitability. Next, we argue via a formal
   model that the availability of/dependence on external financing can
   explain why high-growth firms are rarely eponymous. We find empirical
   support for the model's predictions using a large data set of 1 million
   European firms. Eponymous firms grow considerably more slowly than
   similarly profitable firms. Moreover, eponymy varies in accordance with
   the firm's financing environment in a pattern consistent with our model.
   We discuss implications for the literature on new-venture strategy.

AB The frequency of special items has increased dramatically over time,
   offering a convenient conduit for the inappropriate classification of
   past, present, and future recurring expenses as nonrecurring.
   Identifying this misclassification is especially important in light of
   the pervasive use of non-generally accepted accounting principles
   earnings in recent periods because special items offer camouflage for
   excluded recurring expenses. Building on prior research, we propose a
   method for identifying the predicted level of special items, attributing
   any excess to opportunism, and demonstrate the importance of this
   partitioning for financial-statement users. In particular, we provide
   evidence that the opportunistic portion of special items is associated
   with lower future earnings, cash flows, and returns. We conclude that
   this portion of special items is more likely to contain
   opportunistically misclassified recurring expenses that should have been
   recognized as such in prior, current, or future periods. Thus, we
   provide a meaningful partition of special items that should be useful to
   investors, analysts, creditors, auditors, and regulators because each of
   these parties must assess the implications of special items.

AB Technology and intellectual property play increasingly critical roles in
   emerging supply chains by endowing products with sought-after
   capabilities. In such technology-intensive supply chains, the technology
   invented by an upstream firm must be embedded in a subsystem that is
   then integrated into apt! system. The technology providers' prevalent
   royalty-driven business model has gotten complicated in this
   multilateral supply chain, prompting formal research attention.
   Moreover, providers also consider forward integration into manufacturing
   to monetize their intellectual property. We characterize the
   appropriateness of different business model decisions for markets, which
   may have varying levels of consumer diversity and competitive intensity
   at intermediate layers. For the technology provider, our key results
   show that a subsystem base royalty approach is the optimal business
   model when dealing with monopolistic intermediaries or having a low
   degree of consumer diversity. However, a full-system base royalty
   business model becomes increasingly optimal when the intermediate supply
   chains face competition and consumer diversity increases. We present
   conditions under which the technology provider may want to forward
   integrate. Our formulation and results are relevant to technology
   providers, policy makers, and industry groups engaged in the prevailing
   heated global discussion on royalty base.

AB Anecdotal evidence suggests that counterfeiting /piracy can help create
   online word of mouth (WOM) and through this boost demand, but how
   powerful is such WOM? To answer this question, we conduct a descriptive
   study with some attempts to establish near causality. We estimate the
   impact of piracy on WOM and ultimately revenue by applying a panel data
   method to all movies widely released in the United States from 2015 to
   2017. In identifying the effects of piracy we make inventive use of
   Russian piracy data to construct instrument variables for piracy in the
   United States. This is possible because the key piracy site, The Pirate
   Bay, has been blocked in Russia since 2015. We find movies with
   prerelease piracy are associated with lower revenues despite the WOM
   effect. Critically, however, we show a positive correlation between
   postrelease piracy and WOM volume, and we extend the field by finding
   that the presence of postrelease piracy is associated with an
   approximately 3.0% increase in box office revenue. We also note the
   impact of a raid by the Swedish Police that temporarily took down The
   Pirate Bay website in December 2014. The period when the site was down
   experienced a decline in WOM volume and revenues, consistent with the
   effect of lower postrelease piracy predicted by our models. Our findings
   suggest approaches to target scarce antipiracy resources, such as
   focusing on tackling damaging prerelease piracy.

AB We study how to reduce congestion in two-sided matching markets with
   private preferences. We measure congestion by the number of bits of
   information that agents must (i) learn about their own preferences, and
   (ii) communicate with others before obtaining their final match.
   Previous results suggest that a high level of congestion is inevitable
   under arbitrary preferences before the market can clear with a stable
   matching. We show that when the unobservable component of agent
   preferences satisfies certain natural assumptions, it is possible to
   recommend potential matches and encourage informative signals such that
   the market reaches a stable matching with a low level of congestion.
   Moreover, under our proposed approach, agents have negligible incentive
   to leave the marketplace or to look beyond the set of recommended
   partners. The intuitive idea is to only recommend partners with whom
   there is a nonnegligible chance that the agent will both like them and
   be liked by them. The recommendations are based on both the observable
   component of preferences and signals sent by agents on the other side
   that indicate interest.

AB A buyer who wants to procure a complex good is often aware that there
   may be flaws in her initial design, but she does not know what they look
   like. Potential sellers who discover flaws have no incentive to reveal
   them early if the buyer uses a price-only auction. We derive an
   efficient mechanism that induces all sellers to report flaws early and
   that allocates the project to the seller with the lowest cost. We show
   that this can be implemented with a simple two-stage auction that does
   not require any prior knowledge of the set of possible flaws.

AB Time-series data-measurements of a quantity over time-can be presented
   as stocks (the quantity at each point in time) or flows (the change in
   quantity from one point in time to the next). In a series of six
   experiments, we find that the choice of presenting data as stocks or
   flows can have a consequential impact on judgments. The same data can
   lead to positive or negative assessments when presented as stocks versus
   flows and can engender optimistic or pessimistic forecasts for the
   future. For example, when employment data from 2007 to 2013 are shown as
   flows (jobs created or lost), President Obama's impact on the economy
   during his first year in office is viewed positively, whereas when the
   same data are shown as stocks (total jobs), his impact is viewed
   negatively. The results highlight a challenge that accompanies the
   growing reliance on data and analytics for decision making within
   organizations: seemingly benign choices-such as that between two
   informationally equivalent data presentations-can substantively impact
   how data are interpreted and used, even though the underlying
   information is the same.

AB Inventory-based pricing under lost sales is an important yet notoriously
   challenging problem in the operations management literature. The vast
   existing literature on this problem focuses on identifying optimality
   conditions for a simple management policy while restricting to special
   classes of demand functions and to the special case of single-period or
   long-term stationary settings. In view of the existing developments, it
   seems unlikely to find general, easy-to-verify conditions for a
   tractable optimal policy in a possibly nonstationary environment.
   Instead, we take a different approach to tackle this problem.
   Specifically, we refine our analysis to a class of intuitively appealing
   policies, under which the price is decreasing in the postorder inventory
   level. Using properties of stochastic functions, we show that, under
   very general conditions on the stochastic demand function, the objective
   function is concave along such price paths, leading to a simple base
   stock list price policy. We identify the upper and lower boundaries for
   a candidate set of decreasing price paths and show that any decreasing
   path outside of this set is always dominated by some inside the set in
   terms of profit performance. The boundary policies can be computed
   efficiently through a single-dimensional search. An extensive numerical
   analysis suggests that choosing boundary policies yields
   close-to-optimal profit-in most instances, one of the boundary policies
   indeed generates the optimal profit; even when they are not, the profit
   loss is very marginal.

AB This paper examines how media rankings shift patterns of collaboration
   and deference between professional groups within organizations.
   Diversified and multidisciplinary organizations such as universities and
   hospitals often face distinct subunit evaluations that can influence
   coordination on interdependent tasks. Using patient-level treatment data
   for more than five million in-patient stays, I find that changes in the
   "best hospitals" rankings do not meaningfully shift treatment patterns
   by physicians in hospitals. However, when specialties were ranked in the
   top echelons (i.e., top 10) or had high categorical prestige, they were
   less likely to involve other specialties (i.e., ego effect) and had a
   higher chance of performing procedures on patients admitted in other
   specialties (i.e., halo effect). These effects were mostly confined to
   minor (i.e., less invasive) procedures, implying that the impact of
   external rankings on patient outcomes is relatively benign.

AB We study the optimal referral strategy of a seller and its relationship
   with the type of communication channels among consumers. The seller
   faces a partially uninformed population of consumers, interconnected
   through a directed social network. In the network, the seller offers
   rewards to informed consumers (influencers) conditional on inducing
   purchases by uninformed consumers (influenced). Rewards are needed to
   bear a communication cost and to induce word of mouth (WOM) either
   privately (cost per contact) or publicly (fixed cost to inform all
   friends). From the seller's viewpoint, eliciting Private WOM is more
   costly than eliciting Public WOM. We investigate (1) the incentives for
   the seller to move to a denser network, inducing either Private or
   Public WOM, and (2) the optimal mix between the two types of
   communication. A denser network is found to be always better not only
   for information diffusion but also for seller's profits, as long as
   Private WOM is concerned. Differently, under Public WOM, the seller may
   prefer an environment with less competition between informed consumers,
   and the presence of highly connected influencers (hubs) is the main
   driver to make network density beneficial to profits. When the seller is
   able to discriminate between Private and Public WOM, the optimal
   strategy is to cheaply incentivize the more connected people to pass on
   the information publicly and then offer a high bonus for Private WOM.

AB We study a setting in which dynamically arriving items are assigned to
   waiting agents, who have heterogeneous values for distinct items and
   heterogeneous outside options. An ideal match would both target items to
   agents with the worst outside options and match them to items for which
   they have high value. Our first finding is that two common
   approaches-using independent lotteries for each item and using a
   waitlist in which agents lose priority when they reject an offer-lead to
   identical outcomes in equilibrium. Both approaches encourage agents to
   accept items that are marginal fits. We show that the quality of the
   match can be improved by using a common lottery for all items. If
   participation costs are negligible, a common lottery is equivalent to
   several other mechanisms, such as limiting participants to a single
   lottery, using a waitlist in which offers can be rejected without
   punishment, or using artificial currency. However, when there are many
   agents with low need, there is an unavoidable trade-off between matching
   and targeting. In this case, utilitarian welfare may be maximized by
   focusing on good matching (if the outside option distribution is light
   tailed) or good targeting (if it is heavy tailed). Using a common
   lottery achieves near-optimal matching, whereas introducing
   participation costs achieves nearoptimal targeting.

AB Can television be used to teach and foster entrepreneurship among youth
   in developing countries? We report from a randomized control field
   experiment of an edutainment show on entrepreneurship broadcasted over
   almost three months on national television in Tanzania. The field
   experiment involved more than 2,000 secondary school students, where the
   treatment group was incentivized to watch the edutainment show. We find
   some suggestive evidence of the edutainment show making the viewers more
   interested in entrepreneurship and business, particularly among females.
   However, our main finding is a negative effect: the edutainment show
   discouraged investment in schooling without convincingly replacing it
   with some other valuable activity. Administrative data show a strong
   negative treatment effect on school performance, and long-term survey
   data show that fewer treated students continue schooling, but we do not
   find much evidence of the edutainment show causing an increase in
   business ownership. The fact that an edutainment show for
   entrepreneurship caused the students to invest less in education carries
   a general lesson to the field experimental literature by showing the
   importance of taking a broad view of possible implications of a field
   intervention.

AB The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National
   Quality Forum have endorsed the 30-day mortality rate as an important
   indicator of hospital quality. Concerns have been raised, however, as to
   whether postdischarge mortality rates are reasonable measures of
   hospital quality as they consider the frequency of an event that occurs
   after a patient is discharged and is no longer under the watch and care
   of hospital staff. Estimating the causal effect of length of stay (LOS)
   on postdischarge mortality from retrospective data introduces a number
   of econometric challenges. We describe three potential sources of
   (endogeneity and censoring) biases and propose an approach that provides
   conservative estimates of the true treatment effect. Using a large data
   set comprising all hospital encounters of every Medicare fee-for-service
   patient with acute myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2011, we find
   evidence that an increase in LOS is associated with a decrease in 30-day
   mortality rates. An additional day in the hospital could decrease 30-day
   mortality rates by over 6%. Moreover, we find that, from a social
   planner's perspective, the gains achieved in reducing mortality rates
   likely exceed the cost of keeping the patients in the hospital for an
   additional day.

AB Most investor coordination remains undisclosed. I provide empirical
   evidence on the extent and consequences of investor coordination in the
   context of hedge fund activism, in which potential benefits and costs
   from coordination are especially pronounced. In particular, I examine
   whether hedge fund activists orchestrate "wolf packs"-that is, groups of
   investors willing to acquire shares in the target firm before the
   activist's campaign is publicly disclosed via a 13D filing-as a way to
   support the campaign and strengthen the activist's bargaining position.
   Using a novel hand-collected data set, I develop a method to identify
   the formation of wolf packs before the 13D filing. I investigate two
   competing hypotheses: the Coordinated Effort Hypothesis (wolf packs are
   orchestrated by lead activists to circumvent securities regulations
   about "groups" of investors) and the Spontaneous Formation Hypothesis
   (wolf packs spontaneously arise because investors independently monitor
   and target the same firms at about the same time). A number of tests
   rule out the Spontaneous Formation Hypothesis and provide support for
   the Coordinated Effort Hypothesis. Finally, the presence of a wolf pack
   is associated with various measures of the campaign's success.

AB Accuracy and consistency are critical for inspections to be an
   effective, fair, and useful tool for assessing risks, quality, and
   suppliers-and for making decisions based on those assessments. We
   examine how inspector schedules could introduce bias that erodes
   inspection quality by altering inspector stringency. Our analysis of
   thousands of food-safety inspections reveals that inspectors are
   affected by the inspection outcomes at their prior-inspected
   establishment (outcome effects), citing more violations after they
   inspect establishments that exhibited worse compliance levels or trends.
   Moreover, consistent with negativity bias, the effect is stronger after
   observing compliance deterioration than improvement. Inspection results
   are also affected by when the inspection occurs within an inspector's
   day (daily schedule effects): Inspectors cite fewer violations after
   spending more time conducting inspections throughout the day and when
   inspections risk prolonging their typical workday. Overall, our findings
   suggest that currently unreported violations would be cited if the
   outcome effects-which increase scrutiny-were triggered more often and if
   the daily schedule effects-which erode scrutiny-were reduced. For
   example, our estimates indicate that if outcome effects were doubled and
   daily schedule effects were fully mitigated, 11% more violations would
   be detected, enabling remedial actions that could substantially reduce
   foodbome illnesses and hospitalizations. Understanding and addressing
   these inspection biases can help managers and policymakers improve not
   only food safety but also process quality, environmental practices,
   occupational safety, and working conditions.

AB We study compatibility decisions of two competing platform owners that
   generate profits through both hardware sales and royalties from content
   sales. We consider a game-theoretic model in which two platforms offer
   different standalone utilities to users. We find that incentives to
   establish one-way compatibility-the platform owner with smaller
   standalone value grants access to its proprietary content application to
   users of the competing platform-can arise from the difference in their
   profit foci. As the difference in the standalone utilities increases,
   royalties from content sales become less important to the platform owner
   with greater standalone value, but more important to the other platform
   owner. One-way compatibility can thus increase asymmetry between the
   platform owners' profit foci and, given a sufficiently large difference
   in the standalone utilities, yields greater profits for both platform
   owners. We further show that social welfare is greater under one-way
   compatibility than under incompatibility. We also investigate how

   show that the anomaly does not hold in market downturns. The asset beta
   and financial leverage of distressed stocks rise significantly during
   bear markets, resulting in a dramatic increase in their equity beta.
   Hence, a long/short healthy-minus-distressed trading strategy leads to
   significant losses when the market rebounds. Managing this risk
   mitigates the severe losses of financial distress strategies and
   significantly improves their Sharpe ratios. Our results remain strongly

AB We investigate how firms can use the results of field experiments to
   optimize the targeting of promotions when prospecting for new customers.
   We evaluate seven widely used machine-learning methods using a series of
   two large-scale field experiments. The first field experiment generates
   a common pool of training data for each of the seven methods. We then
   validate the seven optimized policies provided by each method together
   with uniform benchmark policies in a second field experiment. The
   findings not only compare the performance of the targeting methods, but
   also demonstrate how well the methods address common data challenges.
   Our results reveal that when the training data are ideal, model-driven
   methods perform better than distance-driven methods and classification
   methods. However, the performance advantage vanishes in the presence of
   challenges that affect the quality of the training data, including the
   extent to which the training data captures details of the implementation
   setting. The challenges we study are covariate shift, concept shift,
   information loss through aggregation, and imbalanced data. Intuitively,
   the model-driven methods make better use of the information available in
   the training data, but the performance of these methods is more
   sensitive to deterioration in the quality of this information. The
   classification methods we tested performed relatively poorly. We explain

AB We propose a new method to disentangle individual from team
   productivity, CoScore. CoScore uses the varying membership and levels of
   success of all teams to simultaneously infer an individual's
   productivity and her credit for each of her teams' successes. Crucially,
   the productivities of all individuals are determined endogenously via
   the solution of a fixed point problem. We show that CoScore is well
   defined, and we provide axiomatic foundations for the inferred credit
   allocation. We illustrate CoScore in scientific research and sports.

AB This paper studies heuristic thinking and cognitive bias using a natural
   experiment from the field. The setting for the study is a set of acute
   care hospitals, where we examine the care process and discharge
   decisions for individual patients. Determining a patient's suitability
   for discharge is cognitively taxing, calling for the decision maker to
   draw on up-to-date clinical expertise and detailed information. We
   postulate that bounded rationality in decision making can lead the care
   provider to substitute clinical readiness for discharge, a more
   cognitively complex attribute, with the observed days spent in the
   hospital, a more easily accessible heuristic. Identifying the use of the
   heuristic is challenging, as patient readiness for discharge is often
   correlated with the time spent in the hospital. Our identification
   strategy, motivated by regression discontinuity design, exploits a
   discontinuity associated with the admission process at midnight. On the
   basis of more than 177,000 patient discharges spanning eight years, we
   find support for the use of the heuristic: 19.2% (95% confidence
   interval (CI) [14.6%, 23.8%]) of patients incur an increased length of
   stay by a day on average as a result of the heuristic. We also find that
   the reliance on the heuristic is associated with overtreatment;
   postmidnight patients on average cost $512 (95% CI [$100, $923]) more
   but without any corresponding improvement in healthcare outcomes. A
   counterfactual analysis shows that eliminating the heuristic lowers the
   bed capacity needed to maintain the same patient throughput. For
   example, for a hospital unit in our study with a bed capacity of 106,
   eliminating the heuristic would allow the hospital to maintain the same
   throughput with 1.61 fewer beds on average. These findings have a number
   of implications for policy formulation and managerial decision making.

   globally from 2007 to 2015 using data from RepRisk. Then we measure the
   societal impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagements
   using participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) as a
   proxy. We demonstrate a robust and striking difference between public
   and private firms: whereas private firms significantly reduce their
   negative ESG incident levels after UNGC engagements, public firms fail
   to do so and are more likely to engage in decoupled CSR actions-actions
   with no subsequent real impact. We then conduct a series of in-depth
   analyses to examine possible economic mechanisms. Our results are most
   consistent with shareholder-stakeholder conflicts of interest being the
   main moderator of decoupling. The intensity of this conflict is further
   moderated by three factors: ownership type, proximity to final consumers
   on the value chain, and specific ESG incident types. Other possible
   mechanisms, such as selective entry into UNGC and heterogeneities in
   media exposure, country representation, and entry timing, do not survive
   our analysis. Our results suggest that existing CSR engagements and
   one-size-fits-all CSR policy mandates might not necessarily lead to
   better societal outcomes, and a multi-tiered policy targeting different
   ownership and industry types might be more efficient at maximizing ex
   post ESG benefits.

AB Dynamic pricing through price promotions has been widely used by online
   retailers. We study how a promotion strategy, one that offers customers
   a discount for products in their shopping cart, affects customer
   behavior in the short and long term on a retailing platform. We conduct
   a randomized field experiment involving more than 100 million customers
   and 11,000 retailers with Alibaba Group, one of the world's largest
   retailing platform. We randomly assign eligible customers to either
   receive promotions for products in their shopping cart (treatment group)
   or not receive promotions (control group). In the short term, our
   promotion program doubles the sales of promoted products on the day of
   promotion. In the long term, we causally document unintended
   consequences of this promotion program during the month after our
   treatment period. On the positive side, it boosts customer engagement,
   increasing the daily number of products that customers view and their
   purchase incidence on the platform. On the negative side, it intensifies
   strategic customer behavior in the posttreatment period in two ways: (1)
   by increasing the proportion of products that customers add to their
   shopping cart conditional on viewing them, possibly because of their
   intention to get more showing cart promotions, and (2) by decreasing the
   price that customers subsequently pay for a product, possibly because of
   their strategic search for lower prices. Importantly, these long-term
   effects of price promotions on consumer engagement and strategic
   behavior spill over to sellers who did not previously offer promotions
   to customers. Finally, we examine heterogeneous treatment effects across
   promotion, seller, and consumer characteristics. These findings have
   important implications for platforms and retailers.

AB We consider the use and value of social-network information in
   selectively selling goods and services whose value derives from
   exclusive ownership among network connections or friends. Our model
   accommodates customers who are heterogeneous in their number of friends
   (degree) and their proclivity for social comparisons (conspicuity).
   Firms with information on either (or both) of these characteristics can
   use it to make the product selectively available and to personalize
   prices. We find that firms' preferred customers are low degree and high
   conspicuity, with the conspicuity threshold nondecreasing in degree.
   Interestingly, although both degree and conspicuity levels are relevant
   to curating the desired customer base, we find that firms do not need
   conspicuity information to do so; its absence can be substituted by
   incentivizing customers to self-select. There is no such recourse for
   the absence of degree information. As a result, degree information is
   typically more valuable than conspicuity information. Our analysis
   suggests that there are two canonical categories of social
   information-less valuable "consonant" information on characteristics
   where firm and customer preferences are aligned and more valuable
   "competing" information where preferences are misaligned. Customers can
   be incentivized to act in a way that their actions are a perfect
   substitute for consonant information, making it less valuable.

AB This paper studies an inventory management problem faced by an upstream
   supplier that is in a collaborative agreement, such as vendor-managed
   inventory (VMI), with a retailer. A VMI partnership provides the
   supplier an opportunity to manage inventory for the supply chain in
   exchange for point-of-sales (POS)- and inventory-level information from
   the retailer. However, retailers typically possess superior local market
   information and as has been the case in recent years, are able to
   capture and analyze customer purchasing behavior beyond the traditional
   POS data. Such analyses provide the retailer access to market signals
   that are otherwise hard to capture using POS information. We show and
   quantify the implication of the financial obligations of each party in
   VMI that renders communication of such important market signals as
   noncredible. To help institute a sound VMI collaboration, we propose
   learn and screen-a dynamic inventory mechanism-for the supplier to
   effectively manage inventory and information in the supply chain. The
   proposed mechanism combines the ability of the supplier to learn about
   market conditions from POS data (over multiple selling periods) and
   dynamically determine when to screen the retailer and acquire his
   private demand information. Inventory decisions in the proposed
   mechanism serve a strategic purpose in addition to their classic role of
   satisfying customer demand. We show that our proposed dynamic mechanism
   significantly improves the supplier's expected profit and increases the
   efficiency of the overall supply chain operations under a VMI agreement.
   In addition, we determine the market conditions in which a strategic
   approach to VMI results in significant profit improvements for both
   firms, particularly when the retailer has high market power (i.e., when
   the supplier highly depends on the retailer) and when the supplier has
   relatively less knowledge about the end customer/market compared with
   the retailer.

AB Platforms create value by matching participants on alternate sides of
   the marketplace. Although many platforms practice one-to-one matching
   (e.g., Uber), others can conduct and monetize one-to-many simultaneous
   matches (e.g., lead-marketing platforms). Both formats involve one
   dimension of private information, a participant's valuation for
   exclusive or shared allocation, respectively. This paper studies the
   problem of designing an auction format for platforms that mix the modes
   rather than limit to one and, therefore, involve both dimensions of
   information. We focus on incentive-compatible auctions (i.e., where
   truthful bidding is optimal) because of ease of participation and
   implementation. We formulate the problem to find the revenue-maximizing
   incentive-compatible auction as a mathematical program. Although hard to
   solve, the mathematical program leads to heuristic auction designs that
   are simple to implement, provide good revenue, and have speedy
   performance, all critical in practice. It also enables creation of upper
   bounds on the (unknown) optimal auction revenue, which are useful
   benchmarks for our proposed auction designs. By demonstrating a tight
   gap for our proposed two-dimensional reserveprice-based mechanism, we
   prove that it has excellent revenue performance and places low
   information and computational burden on the platform and participants.

   more pricing authority to the agent the more severe the moral hazard
   problem, although doing so further expands the agent's discretion.
   Nevertheless, restricting the agent's pricing authority such that he
   cannot sell to low-valuation customers is typically optimal to prevent
   collusion. We derive optimal collusion-proof contracts, describe
   conditions under which collusion arises in equilibrium, and study the

AB We examine how operational or technological transformation impacts
   consumer value, as well as the effectiveness of a firm's pricing
   strategies. We develop a model of multidimensional screening featuring
   forward-looking consumers who make short-run consumption and long-run
   purchase decisions. Using a detailed panel of consumer data from a
   rental-by-mail firm, we estimate consumer utility for current
   consumption, obtaining heterogeneous preferences for bunching and
   smoothing consumption. Using counterfactual analysis, we evaluate the
   impact of improving service time. We find that the firm with improved
   service time might create more value for all consumers, but its profits
   and even revenues could diminish because value extraction becomes more
   difficult. We find a novel mechanism that causes this effect, which is
   driven by increased consumer heterogeneity in the valuation for each
   product and reduced differentiation across products. This result
   persists even when the firm can reoptimize its price levels based on the
   service time. We find that a change in the pricing strategy might be
   required for the firm to obtain higher revenue with improved service
   time.

AB We investigate the joint impact of managers at different hierarchical
   levels on firm performance in Major League Baseball. We separately
   quantify the contribution of upper and middle managers and the impact of
   their match quality-the degree to which managers cooperate effectively
   across layers to impact firm success. We establish that match quality is
   a statistically significant and economically meaningful driver of firm
   performance. Higher-quality managers tend to be matched together across
   levels and achieve higher match quality during their joint employment.
   Match quality does not improve over the length of a joint employment
   spell, but lower match quality is found in pairs with more divergent
   educational attainment and prior strategic approaches. Hence, match
   quality is partly innate, and manager pairings may have difficulty
   improving their cooperation through learning. When we control for match
   quality, we find significantly lower estimates of heterogeneity in
   manager ability compared with commonly used estimators of managerial
   impact. Still, both middle and upper managers retain a meaningful impact
   on firm performance.

   that the isolated choice effect has important consequences for group

AB We are the first to document and study the use of Rule 10b5-1 preset
   repurchase plans. Though the rule's original intent was to clarify
   conditions for enforcing insider trading laws, generally thought to
   apply to individuals classified as firm insiders, we find strong use of
   the rule at the firm level to repurchase company stock. We exploit this
   new and widespread form of payout to examine an issue at the core of
   payout decisions-the trade-off between commitment and financial
   flexibility. Relative to open market repurchases, preset plans provide
   an expanded repurchase window and increased legal cover, albeit at the
   cost of reducing repurchase flexibility and the option to time
   repurchases. These costs and benefits are significantly associated with
   Rule 10b5-1 adoption: Firms with alternative sources of financial
   flexibility are more likely to precommit to a repurchase plan, as are
   firms with a history of poor repurchase timing and firms constrained by
   blackout windows. Consistent with preset plans signaling commitment,
   Rule 10b5-1 repurchase announcements are associated with greater and
   faster completion rates, with more positive market reactions, and with
   more dividend substitution than open market repurchases. Lastly, we find
   that preset repurchase plans represent a unique payout tool whose
   introduction encouraged a different set of firms to buy back stock and
   significantly altered the payout landscape.

   Management Sci. 62( 5):1415-1430] argues that the portfolio with the
   maximal geometric mean (MGM) asymptotically dominates any other
   portfolio; that is, as the investment horizon becomes very long, the MGM
   portfolio is preferred over any other portfolio for all preferences with
   marginal utility bounded from above, U' <= M. The important economic
   implication is that in the long run, an all-equity portfolio dominates
   bond (or mixed) portfolios, which have lower geometric means. This
   comment shows that Levy's result holds only if the marginal utility is
   also bounded from below. This seemingly technical correction has
   profound economic implications, because many commonly accepted
   preferences do not satisfy the lower bound condition. Indeed, for some
   standard preferences, the optimal stock-bond mix shifts toward bonds,
   not stocks, as the horizon increases, exactly opposite to Levy's

   Yet, adding one condition to the theorem (which can be added in two
   alternate ways) is sufficient to ensure the dominance of stocks over
   bonds in the very long run. For the commonly employed preferences, the
   empirical evidence conforms with the claim given in my original theorem
   1, asserting that the portfolio with the higher geometric mean (stocks)
   dominates the other portfolio under consideration (bonds) as the
   investment horizon increases indefinitely. Thus, as advocated in my
   paper, stocks dominate bonds for investors with typical preferences who
   save for retirement.

   unique sample of more than 15,000 taxpayers in Norway who were likely to
   have misreported their foreign income. By randomly manipulating a letter
   from the tax authorities, we cleanly identify that moral suasion and the
   perceived detection probability play a crucial role in shaping taxpayer
   behavior. The moral letter mainly works on the intensive margin, while
   the detection letter has a strong effect on the extensive margin. We
   further show that only the detection letter has long-term effects on tax
   compliance.

AB We consider dynamic assortment problems with reusable products, in which
   each arriving customer chooses a product within an offered assortment,
   uses the product for a random duration of time, and returns the product
   back to the firm to be used by other customers. The goal is to find a
   policy for deciding on the assortment to offer to each customer so that
   the total expected revenue over a finite selling horizon is maximized.
   The dynamic-programming formulation of this problem requires a
   high-dimensional state variable that keeps track of the on-hand product
   inventories, as well as the products that are currently in use. We
   present a tractable approach to compute a policy that is guaranteed to
   obtain at least 50% of the optimal total expected revenue. This policy
   is based on constructing linear approximations to the optimal value
   functions. When the usage duration is infinite or follows a negative
   binomial distribution, we also show how to efficiently perform rollout
   on a simple static policy. Performing rollout corresponds to using
   separable and nonlinear value function approximations. The resulting
   policy is also guaranteed to obtain at least 50% of the optimal total
   expected revenue. The special case of our model with infinite usage
   durations captures the case where the customers purchase the products
   outright without returning them at all. Under infinite usage durations,
   we give a variant of our rollout approach whose total expected revenue
   differs from the optimal by a factor that approaches 1 with rate
   cubic-root of Cmin, where Cmin is the smallest inventory of a product.
   We provide computational experiments based on simulated data for dynamic
   assortment management, as well as real parking transaction data for the
   city of Seattle. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the
   practical performance of our policies is substantially better than their
   performance guarantees and that performing rollout yields noticeable
   improvements.

AB The behavioral literature has demonstrated that the format of supply
   chain contracts matters even when theoretically it should not and that
   contracts that in theory coordinate channels fail to do so in laboratory
   experiments. The existing body of experimental evidence uses an
   ultimatum bargaining protocol to test analytical models, but there is no
   reason to think that bargaining in supply chains is in the form of
   ultimatum offers. We investigate the effect of bargaining on contract
   performance by extending the bargaining protocol to allow the
   manufacturer to make concessions. We test coordinating contract with
   bargaining in the laboratory by comparing wholesale price and the
   two-part tariff contracts using two different bargaining protocols. We
   then develop and estimate a statistical model of behavior with
   bargaining and find that this model organizes our data well. Our main
   finding is that the contracts that we study are more efficient when
   participants are allowed to make concessions. The additional channel
   efficiency is owing to more efficient offers made by manufacturers. The
   higher channel efficiency primarily benefits the retailer-the weaker
   party. Our main contribution is the observation that, when testing
   analytical models of contracts in the laboratory, the way that the
   bargaining process is implemented, such as the ability to make
   concessions, has a critical effect on conclusions.

AB We examine the effect of charge-price-transparency regulation (PTR)-a
   common policy solution intended to curb rising healthcare costs-on
   hospitals' prices. We find that, although PTR does not affect payments
   or consumer search, it does cause hospitals to reduce charges by
   approximately 5%. The reputational costs of perceived overcharging
   appear to be one impetus for the reduction in charges, suggesting that
   certain stakeholders who are able to impose costs on hospitals are
   unaware that hospitals can decouple charges from payments. The
   ineffectiveness of PTR policies in reducing payments and the apparent
   inability of some stakeholders to realize this fact could explain why
   charge-transparency policies have been widely adopted with little
   opposition. Overall, our findings provide a cautionary note-transparency
   regulation focusing on an indicator that can be decoupled from the
   construct of interest might placate some stakeholders without actually
   solving the underlying problem.

   (QC) system deficiencies, as measured by the Public Company Accounting
   Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection program, on audit quality and
   profitability. Using a unique data set of firmwide QC deficiencies
   identified by the PCAOB during its inspections of audit firms, I find a
   negative association between QC deficiencies, mainly performance
   related, and audit quality. Furthermore, audits conducted by larger
   audit firms with more organization-level deficiencies appear less
   profitable, evidenced by more hours worked on the engagements, leading
   to lower fees per hour. These results appear to be partly explained by
   deficiencies in the tone at the top (a proxy for culture) and the audit
   methodology. Further evidence suggests that a lack of remediation of QC
   system deficiencies has a negative influence on audit quality.

AB Regulating on-demand ride-hailing services (e.g., Uber and DiDi)
   requires a balance of multiple competing objectives: encouraging
   innovative business models (e.g., DiDi), sustaining traditional
   industries (e.g., taxi), creating new jobs, and reducing traffic
   congestion. This study is motivated by a regulatory policy implemented
   by the Chinese government in 2017 and a similar policy approved by the
   New York City Council in 2018 that regulate the "maximum" number of
   registered Uber/DiDi drivers. We examine the impact of these policies on
   the welfare of different stakeholders (i.e., consumers, taxi drivers,
   on-demand ride service company, and independent drivers). By analyzing a
   two-period dynamic game that involves these stakeholders, we find that,
   without government intervention, the on-demand ride service platform can
   drive the traditional taxi industry out of the market under certain
   conditions. Relative to no regulations and a complete ban policy, a
   carefully designed regulatory policy can strike a better balance of
   multiple competing objectives. Finally, if a government can reform the
   taxi industry by adjusting the taxi fare, then lowering the taxi fare
   instead of imposing a strict policy toward on-demand ride services can
   improve the total social welfare.

AB We consider a canonical quantity-based network revenue management
   problem where a firm accepts or rejects incoming customer requests
   irrevocably in order to maximize expected revenue given limited
   resources. Because of the curse of dimensionality, the exact solution to
   this problem by dynamic programming is intractable when the number of
   resources is large. We study a family of re-solving heuristics that
   periodically re-optimize an approximation to the original problem known
   as the deterministic linear program (DLP), where random customer
   arrivals are replaced by their expectations. We find that, in general,
   frequently re-solving the DLP produces the same order of revenue loss as
   one would get without re-solving, which scales as the square root of the
   time horizon length and resource capacities. By re-solving the DLP at a
   few selected points in time and applying thresholds to the customer
   acceptance probabilities, we design a new re-solving heuristic with
   revenue loss that is uniformly bounded by a constant that is independent
   of the time horizon and resource capacities.

   This is principally true for younger workers at employers where skill
   development is encouraged, and the effects are stronger in thicker
   markets where workers with newer skills have more outside options. An
   analysis of the text in online employer reviews supports the notion that
   IT workers value access to interesting IT systems above most other

AB We consider dynamic selection problems, where a decision maker
   repeatedly selects a set of items from a larger collection of available
   items. A classic example is the dynamic assortment problem with demand
   learning, where a retailer chooses items to offer for sale subject to a
   display space constraint. The retailer may adjust the assortment over
   time in response to the observed demand. These dynamic selection
   problems are naturally formulated as stochastic dynamic programs (DPs)
   but are difficult to solve because the optimal selection decisions
   depend on the states of all items. In this paper, we study heuristic
   policies for dynamic selection problems and provide upper bounds on the
   performance of an optimal policy that can be used to assess the
   performance of a heuristic policy. The policies and bounds that we
   consider are based on a Lagrangian relaxation of the DP that relaxes the
   constraint limiting the number of items that may be selected. We
   characterize the performance of the Lagrangian index policy and bound
   and show that, under mild conditions, these policies and bounds are
   asymptotically optimal for problems with many items; mixed policies and
   tiebreaking play an essential role in the analysis of these index
   policies and can have a surprising impact on performance. We demonstrate
   these policies and bounds in two large scale examples: a dynamic
   assortment problem with demand learning and an applicant screening
   problem.

   compounded with the fact that the master problem is combinatorial. To
   overcome this drawback, we present a stabilized Benders decomposition
   whose master is restricted to a neighborhood of successful candidates by
   local-branching constraints, which are dynamically adjusted, and even
   dropped, during the iterations. Our experiments with synthetic and

AB With the growing popularity of corporate social responsibility (CSR),
   critics point out that firms tend to focus on salient CSR activities
   while slacking off on the unobservable ones, using CSR as a marketing
   gimmick. Firms' emphasis on observable aspects and negligence of the
   unobservable aspects are often labeled as greenwashing. This paper
   develops a game-theoretic model of CSR investment, in which consumers
   are socially minded, but they can observe only a subset of CSR
   initiatives. Two types of firms are considered: those that are driven
   solely by profit maximization and those that are socially responsible,
   motivated not only by profit, but also by a genuine concern for the
   social good. Our analysis examines how information transparency affects
   a firm's strategies and the social welfare, and we identify both
   positive and negative aspects of greenwashing. First, low transparency
   incentivizes a profit-driven firm to engage in greenwashing through
   observable investment. Greenwashing prevents consumers from making
   informed purchase decisions but raises overall CSR spending. Second,
   sufficiently high transparency eliminates greenwashing and can motivate
   a socially responsible firm to make extra observable investment under
   the threat of greenwashing on the part of a profit-driven firm. However,
   when transparency further increases, this extra investment diminishes.
   In addition, our paper studies the impacts of firms' budget constraint
   and consumers' bargaining power: Raising the budget and increasing
   consumers' bargaining power can both lead to an inferior social outcome.

AB Human capital is a key factor in value creation in the modern
   corporation. Yet the disclosure of investment in human capital is scant.
   We propose that a company's online job postings are disclosures made
   outside of the investor-relations channel that contain forward-looking
   information that could be informative to investors about future growth.
   We find that changes in the number of job postings are positively
   associated with changes in future performance and that this relation is
   stronger when postings likely represent growth rather than replacement.
   Consistent with job postings providing new information to the market,
   investors react positively to changes in the number of job postings. The
   market reaction to postings is stronger when firms are likely to be
   hiring for growth rather than replacement and for firms with low labor
   intensity (and therefore high marginal productivity of labor).

AB Mortality salience-the awareness of the inevitability of death-is often
   traumatic. However, it can also be associated with a range of positive,
   self-transcendent cognitive responses, such as a greater desire to help
   others, contribute to society, and make a more meaningful contribution
   in one's life and career. In this study, we provide evidence of a link
   between chief executive officer (CEO) mortality salience-triggered by
   the death of a director at the same firm-and a subsequent increase in
   firm-level prosocial behavior or corporate social responsibility (CSR).
   We further show that this core relationship is amplified in situations
   where the death of the director is likely to have been especially
   salient (i.e., the director was appointed within the CEO's tenure, or
   the death was sudden/expected). In supplementary analyses, we find
   suggestive evidence of increased CEO prosociality in other professional
   domains as well as evidence that prosociality seems to be preferentially
   directed toward ingroups.

AB Motivated by bidders' interests in concealing their private information
   in auctions, we propose an ascending clock auction for unit-demand
   assignment problems that economizes on bidder information revelation,
   together with a new general-purpose measure of information revelation.
   Our auction uses an iterative partial reporting design such that for a
   given set of prices, not all bidders are required to report their
   demands, and when they are, they reveal a single preferred item at a
   time instead of all. Our design can better preserve bidder privacy while
   maintaining several good properties: sincere bidding is an ex post Nash
   equilibrium, ending prices are path independent, and efficiency is
   achieved if the auction starts with the auctioneer's reservation values.
   Our measurement of information revelation is based on Shannon's entropy
   and can be used to compare a wide variety of auction and nonauction
   mechanisms. We propose a hybrid quasi-Monte Carlo procedure for
   computing this measure. Our numerical simulations show that our auction
   consistently outperforms a full-reporting benchmark with up to 18% less
   entropy reduction and scales to problems of over 100,000 variables.

   recapitalization of distressed banks. The optimal target and

   consistent with the substantially higher capital requirements proposed
   in Basel III and together achieve most of the regulatory benefits by
   alleviating underinvestment and asset substitution. They are
   interdependent and respond differently to banks' asset characteristics,
   thereby suggesting that regulatory policies should be carefully tuned to

AB Rural consumers may face not only the challenge of affordability but
   also the problem of limited accessibility. Can a government's subsidy
   program effectively address these issues? This paper examines the impact
   of a large-scale subsidy program, "Household electrical appliances going
   to the countryside," offered by the Chinese government. The government
   regulation imposes a price subsidy combined with a price ceiling on
   products in the program. We consider two effects of the subsidy: the
   retail price is lowered to make the product more affordable to
   consumers, and manufacturers are encouraged to expand their distribution
   coverage to make products more accessible to consumers. We build a
   dynamic model of oligopoly to study how firms adjust their distribution
   coverage. Conditional on the model estimates, we evaluate the program's
   effects on social welfare, consumer surplus, and firms' market
   performance and marketing channel decisions through counterfactual
   analyses. We find that the subsidy program increases social welfare by
   CNY 0.209 billion, as a result of a subsidy expense of CNY 0.236
   billion. When breaking down the impact, we find it increases consumer
   surplus by CNY 0.184 billion (50%), manufacturers' profits by CNY 0.125
   billion (53%), and manufacturers' payoffs by CNY 2.5 million (17%).
   Specifically, 14% (13.2%) of the consumer surplus (firm profit)
   increases are from changes in distribution coverage, and the rest is
   from the subsidy (price changes). The program's return of investment
   (i.e., social welfare minus subsidy expense), which is negative,
   however, could be improved by applying a relatively lower subsidy rate.

AB We explore conditions under which a multiproduct firm can profitably
   turn itself into a platform by "hosting rivals," that is, by inviting
   rivals to sell products or services on top of its core product. Hosting
   eliminates the additional shopping costs to consumers of buying a
   specialist rival's competing version of the multiproduct firm's noncore
   product. On the one hand, this makes it easier for the rival to compete
   on the noncore product. On the other hand, hosting turns the rival from
   a pure competitor into a complementor: the value added by its product
   now helps raise consumer demand for the multiproduct firm's core
   product. As a result, hosting can be both unilaterally profitable for
   the multiproduct firm and jointly profitable for both firms.

AB We model an expert review system where two producers competing for
   market share each are evaluated by two raters. Employing economics
   experiments, the paper examines how the rater's incentive to provide
   objective feedback can be distorted in the presence of social ties and
   different penalty structures for assigning unobjective ratings. The
   results reject the self-interested model. We find that raters assign
   more biased ratings to help the producer they know compete, and this
   distortion is exacerbated when the reputation cost for rating
   unobjectively is lowered. Counterintuitively, when both of the raters
   know the same producer, the likelihood of biased ratings drops
   significantly. To explain the empirical regularities, we develop a
   behavioral economics model and show that the rater's utility function
   should account not only for social preferences toward the producer, but
   also the rater's psychological aversion toward favoring a producer more
   than the other rater. Our findings demonstrate that it is critical for
   policymakers to be cognizant of the nonpecuniary factors that can
   influence behavior in expert review systems.

AB Using the staggered and reciprocal passage of interstate bank
   deregulation as an exogenous variation in the degree of bank
   integration, we investigate how and why bank integration influences the
   market for corporate control for nonfinancial firms. We posit that bank
   integration affects acquisitions either through reducing the information
   asymmetry between acquirers and targets or through increasing credit
   supply. Our evidence is more consistent with the former channel.
   Specifically, we document that (1) cross-state acquisitions aremore
   likely to occur between reciprocally deregulated states, and (2) firms
   aremore likely taken over by out-of-state acquirers after deregulation;
   this effect is stronger for a target who borrows from an out-of-state
   bank, whose local bank is acquired by an out-of-state bank, and who is
   informationally more opaque. Announcement returns for acquirers of
   out-of-state (particularly private) targets increase after deregulation,
   consistent with better identification of higher-valued targets by
   acquirers after deregulation.

AB Because many key career events, such as examinations and interviews,
   involve competition and stress, gender differences in response to these
   factors could help to explain the labor market gender gap. In a
   laboratory experiment, we manipulate psychosocial stress using the Trier
   Social Stress Test and confirm that this is effective by measuring
   salivary cortisol level and heart rate. Subjects perform in a
   real-effort task under both tournament and piece-rate incentives, and we
   elicit willingness to compete. We find that women under heightened
   stress perform worse than women in the control group when compensated
   with tournament incentives, whereas there is no treatment difference
   under piece-rate incentives. For men, stress does not affect output
   under competition or under piece rate. The gender gap in willingness to
   compete is not affected by stress, but stress decreases competitiveness
   overall, which is related to performance for women. Our results could
   explain gender differences in performance under competition, with
   implications for hiring practices and incentive structures in firms.

AB A buying firm might in the future incur costs associated with a
   supplier's carbon dioxide emissions, safety violations, or other social
   or environmental impacts. Learning about a supplier's impacts requires
   costly effort, but it is necessary (and sometimes sufficient) to reduce
   those impacts. The capital market valuation of a buying firm reflects
   investors' estimate of future costs associated with a supplier's
   impacts, as well as any costs that the buying firm incurs in order to
   learn about and reduce a supplier's impacts. This paper analyzes a game
   theoretic model in which a manager-with the objective of maximizing the
   capital market valuation of the buying firm-decides whether to learn
   about a supplier's impacts, how much cost to incur to reduce the
   supplier's impacts, and whether to disclose the supplier's impacts to
   investors. The investors have rational expectations (e.g., that a
   manager might withhold bad news about the supplier's impacts ) and value
   the buying firm accordingly. The paper considers a mandate to disclose
   information learned about a supplier's impacts. The paper shows that the
   disclosure mandate deters learning and thus, under plausible conditions,
   results in higher expected impacts. The disclosure mandate can result in
   lower expected impacts only if buying firms face moderately high future
   costs associated with suppliers' impacts. In contrast, a disclosure
   mandate always increases a buying firm's expected discounted profit and
   capital market valuation. A disclosure mandate can induce cooperation
   among buying firms with a shared supplier, yet result in higher expected
   impacts by the supplier. When a buying firm has alternative suppliers,
   the disclosure mandate favors commitment to a supplier to facilitate
   learning about that supplier's impacts (instead of searching for a
   lower-impact supplier).

AB We present a new distributionally robust optimization model called

   scenario-tree-based stochastic linear optimization and distributionally
   robust optimization in a practicable framework that can be solved using
   the state-of-the-art commercial optimization solvers. We also develop a
   new algebraic modeling package, Robust Stochastic Optimization Made Easy
   (RSOME), to facilitate the implementation of RSO models. The model of
   uncertainty incorporates both discrete and continuous random variables,
   typically assumed in scenario-tree-based stochastic linear optimization
   and distributionally robust optimization, respectively. To address the
   nonanticipativity of recourse decisions, we introduce the event-wise
   recourse adaptations, which integrate the scenario-tree adaptation
   originating from stochastic linear optimization and the affine
   adaptation popularized in distributionally robust optimization. Our
   proposed event-wise ambiguity set is rich enough to capture traditional
   statistic-based ambiguity sets with convex generalized moments, mixture
   distribution, phi-divergence, Wasserstein (Kantorovich-Rubinstein)
   metric, and also inspire machine-learning-based ones using techniques
   such as K-means clustering and classification and regression trees.
   Several interesting RSO models, including optimizing over the Hurwicz

   geographic frictions, and in particular travel costs, shape scientists'
   collaboration decisions and the types of projects that are developed
   locally versus over distance. We then take advantage of a
   quasi-experiment-the introduction of new routes by a low-cost airline-to
   test the predictions of the theory. Results show that travel costs
   constitute an important friction to collaboration: after a low-cost
   airline enters, the number of collaborations increases between 0.3 and
   1.1 times, a result that is robust to multiple falsification tests and
   causal in nature. The reduction in geographic frictions is particularly
   beneficial for high-quality scientists that are otherwise embedded in
   worse local environments. Consistent with the theory, lower travel costs
   also endogenously change the types of projects scientists engage in at
   different levels of distance. After the shock, we observe an increase in
   higher-quality and novel projects, as well as projects that take
   advantage of complementary knowledge and skills between subfields, and
   that rely on specialized equipment. We test the generalizability of our
   findings from chemistry to a broader data set of scientific publications
   and to a different field where specialized equipment is less likely to
   be relevant, mathematics. Last, we discuss implications for the
   formation of collaborative research and development teams over distance.

   attested financial reports in bank financing by 12%, and audit fee
   increases for nonprofit organizations (NPOs) more than doubled. The
   second long-run effect was a transformation in the audit supply
   structure. After SOX, NPOs were less likely to match with auditors most
   exposed to public companies, whereas auditors increasingly specialized
   their offices based on client type. Audit market concentration for NPOs
   dropped by more than one-half within five years of SOX and remained at

AB Champion versus challenger field experiments are widely used to compare

   randomly assign customers to receive marketing actions recommended by
   either the existing (champion) policy or the new (challenger) policy,
   and then compare the aggregate outcomes. We recommend an alternative
   experimental design and propose an alternative estimation approach to
   improve the evaluation of targeting policies. The recommended
   experimental design randomly assigns customers to marketing actions.
   This allows evaluation of any targeting policy without requiring an
   additional experiment, including policies designed after the experiment
   is implemented. The proposed estimation approach identifies customers
   for whom different policies recommend the same action and recognizes
   that for these customers there is no difference in performance. This
   allows for a more precise comparison of the policies. We illustrate the
   advantages of the experimental design and estimation approach using data
   from an actual field experiment. We also demonstrate that the grouping
   of customers, which is the foundation of our estimation approach, can
   help to improve the training of new targeting policies.

AB We propose that investor beliefs frequently "cross" in the sense that an
   investor may like company A but dislike company B, whereas another
   investor may like company B but dislike company A. Such belief-crossing
   makes it almost impossible to construct a portfolio that is composed
   solely of every investor's most favored companies. This causes the level
   of excitement for portfolios to be generally lower than the levels of
   excitement that individual companies generate among their most fervent
   supporters. Coupled with short-sale constraints, wherein prices are set
   by the most optimistic investors, this causes portfolios to trade at
   discounts. Utilizing several settings whereby the value of a portfolio
   and the values of the underlying components can be evaluated separately
   (e.g., closed-end funds), we present evidence supporting our proposition
   that, in financial markets, the "whole" is often less than the "sum of
   its parts."

AB Asset prices can be stale. We define price staleness as a lack of price
   adjustments yielding zero returns (i.e., zeros). The term idleness
   (respectively, near idleness) is, instead, used to define staleness when
   trading activity is absent (respectively, close to absent). Using
   statistical and pricing metrics, we show that zeros are a genuine
   economic phe-nomenon linked to the dynamics of trading volume and,
   therefore, liquidity. Zeros are, in general, not the result of
   institutional features, like price discreteness. In essence, spells of
   idleness or near idleness are stylized facts suggestive of a key,
   omitted market friction in the modeling of asset prices. We illustrate
   how accounting for this friction may generate sizable risk compensations
   in short-dated option returns.

AB This paper studies how to schedule medical appointments with
   time-dependent patient no-show behavior and random service times. The
   problem is motivated by our studies of independent datasets from
   countries in two continents that unanimously identify a significant
   time-of-day effect on patient show-up probabilities. We deploy a
   distributionally robust model, which minimizes the worst-case total
   expected costs of patient waiting and service provider's idling and
   overtime, by optimizing the scheduled arrival times of patients. This
   model is challenging because evaluating the total cost for a given
   schedule involves a linear program with uncertainties present in both
   the objective function and the right-hand side of the constraints. In
   addition, the ambiguity set considered contains discrete uncertainties
   and complementary functional relationships among these uncertainties
   (namely, patient no-shows and service durations). We show that when
   patient no-shows are exogenous (i.e., time-independent), the problem can
   be reformulated as a copositive program and then be approximated by
   semidefinite programs. When patient no-shows are endogenous on time (and
   hence on the schedule), the problem becomes a bilinear copositive
   program. We construct a set of dual prices to guide the search for a
   good schedule and use the technique iteratively to obtain a near-optimal
   solution. Our computational studies reveal a significant reduction in
   total expected cost by taking into account the time-of-day variation in
   patient show-up probabilities as opposed to ignoring it.

AB Flow-control policies that balance server loads are well known for
   improving performance of queueing systems with multiple nodes. However,
   although load balancing benefits the system overall, it may negatively
   impact some of the queueing nodes. For example, it may reduce throughput
   rates or engender unfairness with respect to some performance measures.
   For queueing systems with multiple single-server nodes, we propose a set
   of constrained load-balancing policies that ensures the expected arrival
   rate to each queueing node is not reduced, and we show that such
   policies provide multiple benefits for each queueing node:
   stochastically fewer customers and lower variance of the number of
   customers at each queueing node. These results imply performance
   improvement as measured by multiple general objective functions,
   including but not limited to the expected number of customers at a
   queueing node, probability of having a high number of customers,
   variance of the number of customers, and expected number of customers
   conditional on exceeding a threshold defined by a fixed service level.
   We demonstrate numerically that our proposed policies capture a large
   portion of the potential maximal improvement.

AB This paper addresses volunteer labor markets where the lack of price
   signals, nonpecuniary motivations to supply labor, and limited
   fungibility of supply lead to market failure. To address the causes of
   the market failure, we conduct a field experiment with volunteer whole
   blood donors where we introduce a market-clearing mechanism (henceforth:
   the Registry). Our intention-to-treat estimates suggest that subjects
   invited to the Registry, regardless of joining, are 66% more responsive
   to critical shortage appeals than control subjects. While the Registry
   increases supply during a critical shortage episode, it does not
   increase supply when there is no shortage; thus, the Registry
   significantly improves coordination between volunteer donors and
   collection centers, thereby improving market outcomes. We find evidence
   that the Registry's effectiveness stems from crowding-in volunteers with
   purely altruistic motives and volunteers with a preference for
   commitment.

AB Corporations often transact in their own mispriced stock. This activity,
   known as equity market timing, can generate substantial profits and
   increase the long-term stock price. We challenge a closely related
   popular view that market timing always benefits firm shareholders.
   Opportunistic financing maneuvers by a firm can negatively affect its
   un-informed stock owners because of adverse selection and the change in
   the firm's short-term price, whereas the long-term returns do not
   accumulate to departing stockholders. The negative effect of market
   timing on stockholders increases with the share turnover. Furthermore,
   the effect of timing is asymmetric: shareholders prefer that the firm
   corrects underpricing rather than overpricing. Our theory can be used to
   better interpret the observed stock issuance and repurchase activities
   of firms.

AB We develop a model of the feedback between mutual fund outflows and
   asset illiquidity. Following a market shock, alert investors anticipate
   the impact on a fund's net asset value (NAV) of other investors'
   redemptions and exit first at favorable prices. This first-mover
   advantage may lead to fund failure through a cycle of falling prices and
   increasing redemptions. Our analysis shows that (i) the first-mover
   advantage introduces a nonlinear dependence between a market shock and
   the aggregate impact of redemptions on the fund's NAV; (ii) as a
   consequence, there is a critical magnitude of the shock beyond which
   redemptions brings down the fund; (iii) properly designed swing pricing
   transfers liquidation costs from the fund to redeeming investors and, by
   removing the nonlinearity stemming from the first-mover advantage, it
   reduces these costs and prevents fund failure. Achieving these
   objectives requires a larger swing factor at larger levels of outflows.
   The swing factor for one fund may also depend on policies followed by
   other funds.

AB A major credit shock can induce large intraday variation margin payments
   between counterparties in derivatives markets, which may force some
   participants to default on their payments. These payment shortfalls
   become amplified as they cascade through the network of exposures. Using
   detailed Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation data, we model the full
   network of exposures, shock-induced payments, initial margin collected,
   and liquidity buffers for about 900 firms operating in the U.S. credit
   default swaps market. We estimate the total amount of contagion, the
   marginal contribution of each firm to contagion, and the number of
   defaulting firms for a systemic shock to credit spreads. A novel feature
   of the model is that it allows for a range of behavioral responses to
   balance sheet stress, including delayed or partial payments. The model
   provides a framework for analyzing the relative effectiveness of
   different policy options, such as increasing margin requirements or

   such platforms should rank products displayed to consumers and utilize
   the top and most salient slots. We present a model that considers
   consumers' search costs and the externalities sellers im-pose on each
   other. This model allows us to study a multiobjective optimization,
   whose objective includes consumer and seller surplus as well as the
   sales revenue, and derive the optimal ranking decision. In addition, we
   propose a surplus-ordered ranking mechanism for selling some of the top
   slots. This mechanism is motivated in part by Amazon's sponsored search
   program. We show that the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism would not be
   applicable to our setting and propose a new mechanism. This mechanism is
   near optimal, performing significantly better than those that do not
   incentivize sellers to reveal their private information regarding each
   consumer purchase, such as their profit. Moreover, we generalize our
   model to settings in which platforms can provide partial information
   about the products and facilitate the consumer search and show the

AB Mixture models are versatile tools that are used extensively in many
   fields, inducting operations, marketing, and econometrics. The main
   challenge in estimating mixture models is that the mixing distribution
   is often unknown, and imposing a priori parametric assumptions can lead
   to model misspecification issues. In this paper, we propose a new
   methodology for non-parametric estimation of the mixing distribution of
   a mixture of logit models. We formulate the likelihood-based estimation
   problem as a constrained convex program and apply the conditional
   gradient (also known as Frank-Wolfe) algorithm to solve this
   convexprogram. We show that our method iteratively generates the support
   of the mixing distribution and the mixing proportions. Theoretically, we
   establish the sublinear convergence rate of our estimator and
   characterize the structure of the recovered mixing distribution.
   Empirically, we test our approach on real-world datasets. We show that
   it outperforms the standard expectation-maximization (EM) benchmark on
   speed (16 times faster), in-sample fit (up to 24% reduction in the
   log-likelihood loss), and predictive (average 28% reduction in standard
   error metrics) and decision accuracies (extracts around 23% more
   revenue). On synthetic data, we show that our estimator is robust to
   different ground-truth mixing distributions and can also account for
   endogeneity.

AB I investigate three goals of school choice: welfare, encouraging
   neighborhood schools, and diversity. I use optimization problems to find
   the best stable and incentive compatible match for any combination of
   these objectives. These problems assume there is a continuum of students
   and school seats, which allows me to describe the incentive
   compatibility conditions in a tractable form. I prove that the set of
   stable matchings is generically continuous in the distribution of
   students and the school capacities, which implies that the
   characterization of the possible stable matches in the continuum model
   approximates the set of stable matches in a matching market with a
   large, but finite, number of students. I then apply my framework to data
   from Boston Public Schools. If the mechanism conditions on demographics,
   the improvement (relative to the status quo) in student welfare is
   equivalent to moving 291 students (out of 3,479) to schools one rank
   higher in their preference lists. In contrast, if the mechanism does not
   condition on demographics, the welfare improvement is equivalent to
   moving only 25.1 students to schools one rank higher. Improvements in
   the distributional goals can be made (e.g., increasing enrollment in
   neighborhood schools by 50%) without reducing welfare or diversity.

AB Safety alerts are announcements made by health regulators warning
   patients and doctors about new drug-related side effects. However, not
   all safety alerts are equally effective. We provide evidence that the
   day of the week on which the safety alerts are announced explains
   differences in safety alert impact. Specifically, we show that safety
   alerts announced on Fridays are less broadly diffused: they are shared
   34% less on social media, mentioned in 23% to 66% fewer news articles,
   and are 12% to 51% less likely to receive any news coverage at all. As a
   consequence of this, we propose Friday alerts are less effective in
   reducing drug-related side effects. We find that moving a Friday alert
   to any other weekday would reduce all drug-related side effects by 9% to
   12%, serious drug-related complications by 6% to 15%, and drug-related
   deaths by 22% to 36%. This problem is particularly important because
   Friday was the most frequent weekday for safety alert announcements from
   1999 to 2016. We show that this greater prevalence of Friday alerts
   might not be random: firms that lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug
   Administration in the past are 49% to 56% more likely to have safety
   alerts announced on Fridays.

AB Many products have similar or common attributes and are thus correlated.
   We show that, when these attributes are uncertain for consumers, a
   complementarity effect can arise among competing products in the sense
   that the lower price of one product may increase the demands for the
   others. This effect occurs when consumers sequentially search for
   information about both common and idiosyncratic product attributes
   before purchase. We characterize the optimal search strategy for the
   correlated search problem, provide the conditions for the existence of
   the complementarity effect, and show that the effect is robust under a
   wide range of alternative assumptions. We further explore the
   implications of the effect for pricing. When firms compete in price,
   although product correlation may weaken differentiation between the
   firms, the complementarily effect owing to correlated search may raise
   equilibrium price and profit.

AB Mental simulations such as anticipatory and/or retrospective emotions

   well-being (i.e., negative devaluing). In this research, we investigate
   the behavioral and welfare implications of negative devaluing for
   intertemporal consumptions in an intrapersonal game. Our general
   framework accounts for two distinctions: desired versus undesired
   consumptions, and naive versus sophisticated beliefs about future
   selves' preferences. Naive people pro-crastinate desired consumptions
   and preproperate undesired ones. The behavior of so-phisticated people
   generally exhibits a cyclical pattern. Sophistication may either
   mitigate or exacerbate the time-inconsistency problem, and hence may
   improve or undermine long-run welfare, depending on the valence and the
   units of consumptions and on whether consumptions are tied
   consecutively. In addition, our comparative statics analysis generates
   surprising results with respect to the impacts of decision parameters
   (e.g., deadline, consumption units). We also discuss implications for

AB We consider a lender (bank) that determines the optimal loan price
   (interest rate) to offer to prospective borrowers under uncertain
   borrower response and default risk. A borrower may or may not accept the
   loan at the price offered, and both the principal loaned and the
   interest income become uncertain because of the risk of default. We
   present a risk-based loan pricing optimization framework that explicitly
   takes into account the marginal risk contribution, the portfolio risk,
   and a borrower's acceptance probability. Marginal risk assesses the
   incremental risk contribution of a prospective loan to the bank's
   overall portfolio risk by capturing the dependencies between the
   prospective loan and the existing portfolio and is evaluated with
   respect to the value-at-risk and conditional value-at-risk measures. We
   examine the properties and computational challenges of the formulations.
   We design a reformulation method based on the concavifiability concept
   to transform the nonlinear objective functions and to derive equivalent
   mixed-integer non-linear reformulations with convex continuous
   relaxations. We also extend the approach to multiloan pricing problems,
   which feature explicit loan selection decisions in addition to pricing
   decisions. We derive formulations with multiple loans that take the form
   of mixed-integer nonlinear problems with nonconvex continuous
   relaxations and develop a computationally efficient algorithmic method.
   We provide numerical evidence demonstrating the value of the proposed
   framework, test the computational tractability, and discuss managerial

   designated the future ambiguity effect. This effect generalizes across
   various choice sets, payoff levels, and delays, and it prevails even
   when a future smaller ambiguous payoff is preferred more than a future
   larger precise payoff. Two underlying processes are proposed and
   supported: (1) the payoff ambiguity's explicit risk of receiving a
   smaller payoff distracts people from the future's larger implicit risk
   of receiving nothing, and (2) payoff ambiguity restores some of the
   excitement lost to the future's psychological distance. Nonetheless, the
   future ambiguity effect is not universal, given that larger ranges can
   reduce and even eliminate it (boundary condition).

AB This paper predicts and finds that investor uncertainty surrounding a
   key information release event-the earnings announcement-is decreasing in
   a firm's reporting streak. We use two proxies related to investor ex
   ante uncertainty and corresponding pricing of such uncertainty:
   option-implied volatilities and variance risk premiums; both are
   measured with maturities surrounding the impending quarterly earnings
   announcement. Consistent with prior research, we measure reporting
   streak as the number of consecutive quarters the firm meets or beats the
   consensus analyst earnings-per-share forecast. Empirical results confirm
   expectations that the two uncertainty-related constructs are decreasing
   in the length of the reporting streak. These results, combined with
   further evidence documenting that lower uncertainty leads to lower stock
   returns surrounding the earnings announcements, suggest that longer
   reporting streaks reflect lower risk during earnings announcements.

AB We examine the near-privity rule that increases the auditor's legal
   liability exposure by considering a debtholder who can sue the auditor
   and recover damages when there is an audit failure. We show that the
   increase in the auditor's legal liability induces the auditor to choose
   more informative and more conservative efforts. Although the increased
   informative effort has a favorable spillover effect that increases the
   equityholder's expected payoff, the increased conservative effort
   induces a bias-that is, decreases the likelihood of reporting a true
   good state as good-and thus induces an adverse spillover effect that
   decreases the equityholder's expected payoff. As such, when the
   conservative effort bias is small, the favorable spillover effect
   dominates the adverse spillover effect, and the equityholder prefers the
   near-privity regime.

AB The cities of Paris, London, Chicago, and New York (among many others)
   have set up bike-share systems to facilitate the use of bicycles for
   urban commuting. This paper estimates the impact of two facets of system
   performance on bike-share ridership: accessibility (how far the user
   must walk to reach stations) and bike-availability (the like-lihood of
   finding a bicycle). We obtain these estimates from a structural demand
   model for ridership estimated using data from the Velib' system in
   Paris. We find that every additional meter of walking to a station
   decreases a user's likelihood of using a bike from that station by
   0.194% (+/- 0.0693%), and an even more significant reduction at higher
   distances (>300 m). These estimates imply that almost 80% of bike-share
   usage comes from areas within 300 m of stations, highlighting the need
   for dense station networks. We find that a 10% increase in
   bike-availability would increase ridership by 12.211% (+/- 1.097%),
   three-fourths of which comes from fewer abandonments and the rest of
   which comes from increased user interest. We illustrate the use of our
   estimates in comparing the effect of adding stations or increasing
   bike-availabilities in different parts of the city, at different times,
   and in evaluating other proposed improvements.

AB Hospital managers struggle with the day-to-day variability in patient
   admissions to different clinical services, each of which typically has a
   fixed allocation of hospital beds. In response, many hospitals engage in
   capacity pooling by assigning patients from a service whose designated
   beds are fully occupied to an available bed in a unit designated for a
   different service. This "off-service placement" occurs frequently, yet
   its impact on patient and operational measures has not been rigorously
   quantified. This is, in part, because of the challenge of properly
   accounting for the endogenous selection of off-service patients. We use
   an instrumental variable approach to quantify the causal effects of
   off-service placement of hospitalized medical/surgical patients, having
   accounted for the endogeneity issues. Using data from a large academic
   medical center with 19.6% of medical/surgical patients placed off
   service on average, we find that off-service placement is associated
   with a 22.8% increase in remaining hospital length of stay (LOS) and a
   13.1% increase in the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days.
   We find no significant effect on in-hospital mortality or clinical
   trigger ( rapid response) activation. We identify longer distances to
   the service's home unit as a key mechanism that drives the effect on
   LOS. In contrast, a mismatch in nursing specialization does not seem to
   explain this effect. By quantifying the effects of off-service placement
   on patient and operational outcomes, we enable clinicians and hospital
   managers to make better-informed short-term decisions about off-service
   placement and longer-term decisions about capacity allocation.

AB Blockchain-based platforms often rely on token-weighted voting
   ("t-weighting") to efficiently crowdsource information from their users
   for a wide range of applications, including content curation and
   on-chain governance. We examine the effectiveness of such decentralized
   platforms for harnessing the wisdom and effort of the crowd. We find
   that t-weighting generally discourages truthful voting and erodes the
   platform's predictive power unless users are "strategic enough" to
   unravel the underlying aggregation mechanism. Platform accuracy
   decreases with the number of truthful users and the dispersion in their
   token holdings, and in many cases, platforms would be better off with a
   "flat" 1/n mechanism. When, prior to voting, strategic users can exert
   effort to endogenously improve their signals, users with more tokens
   generally exert more effort-a feature often touted in marketing
   materials as a core advantage of t-weighting-however, this feature is
   not attributable to the mechanism itself, and more importantly, the
   ensuing equilibrium fails to achieve the first-best accuracy of a
   centralized platform. The optimality gap decreases as the distribution
   of tokens across users approaches a theoretical optimum, which we
   derive, but tends to increase with the dispersion in users' token
   holdings.

AB We present a general framework to study the design of spare parts
   logistics in the presence of three-dimensional (3-D) printing
   technology. We consider multiple parts facing stochastic demands and
   adopt procure/manufacture-to-stock versus print-on-demand to highlight
   the main difference of production modes featured in traditional
   manufacturing and 3-D printing. To minimize long-run average system
   cost, our model determines which parts to stock and which to print. We
   find that the optimal 3-D printer's utilization increases as the
   additional unit cost of printing declines and the printing speed
   improves. The rate of increase, however, decays, demonstrating the
   well-known diminishing returns effect. We also find the optimal
   utilization to increase in part variety and decrease in part
   criticality, suggesting the value of 3-D technology in tolerating large
   part variety and the value of inventory for critical parts. By examining
   the percentage cost savings enabled by 3-D printing, we find that,
   although the reduction in printing cost continuously adds to the value
   of 3-D printing in a linear fashion, the impact of the improvement of
   printing speed exhibits S-shaped growth. We also derive various
   structural properties of the problem and devise an efficient algorithm
   to obtain near optimal solutions. Finally, our numerical study shows
   that the 3-D printer is, in general, lightly used under realistic
   parameter settings but results in significant cost savings, suggesting
   complementarity between stock and print in cost minimization.

AB Consumers regard product delivery as an important service component that
   influences their shopping decisions on online retail platforms.
   Delivering products to customers in a timely and reliable manner
   enhances customer experience and companies' profitability. In this
   research, we explore the extent to which customers value a high-quality
   delivery experience when shopping online. Our identification strategy
   exploits a natural experiment: a clash between SF Express and Alibaba,
   the largest private logistics service provider with the highest
   reputation in delivery quality in China and the largest online retail
   platform in China, respectively. The clash resulted in Alibaba
   unexpectedly removing SF Express as a shipping option from Alibaba's
   retail platform for 42 hours in June 2017. Using a
   difference-in-differences design, we analyze the market performance of
   129,448 representative stock-keeping units on Alibaba to quantify the
   economic value of a high-quality delivery service to sales, product
   variety, and logistics rating. We find that the removal of the
   high-quality delivery option from Alibaba's retail platform reduced
   sales by 14.56% during the clash, increased the contribution of
   long-tail to total sales-sales dispersion-by 3%, but did not impact the
   variety and logistics rating of sold products. Furthermore, we also
   identify product characteristics that attenuate the value of
   high-quality logistics and find that the removal of SF Express is more
   obstructive for (1) star products as compared with long-tail products
   because the same star products are likely to be supplied by competing
   retail platforms that customers can easily switch to, (2) expensive
   products because customers need a reliable delivery service to protect
   their valuable items from damage or loss, and ( 3) less-discounted
   products because customers are more willing to sacrifice the service
   quality over a price markdown.

AB Stock and options markets can disagree about a stock's value because of
   informed trading in options and/or price pressure in the stock. The
   predictability of stock returns based on this cross-market discrepancy
   in values is especially strong when accompanied by stock price pressure,
   and it does not depend on trading in options. We argue that
   option-implied prices provide an anchor for fundamental stock values
   that helps to distinguish stock price movements resulting from pressure
   versus news. Overall, our results are consistent with stock price
   pressure being the primary driver of the option pricebased stock return
   predictability.

   reference level over time. We find that the individual protects current
   consumption by delaying painful reductions in consumption after a drop
   in wealth, and increasingly so with higher degrees of endogeneity. The
   incentive to protect current consumption is stronger with a medium
   wealth level than with a high or low wealth level. Furthermore, this
   individual adopts a conservative investment strategy in normal states
   and typically a more aggressive strategy in good and bad states.
   Endogeneity of the reference level increases overall risk-taking and
   generates an incentive to reduce risk exposure with age even without

AB This paper endogenizes auction timing and initiation in auctions of real
   options. Because bidders have information rent, a seller faces a
   "virtual strike price" higher than the actual exercise cost. The seller
   inefficiently delays the auction to encourage bidder participation and
   uses the irreversible nature of time to gain partial control over option
   exercises. The seller's private benefit at option exercise may restore
   efficient auction timing, but option exercises are always inefficiently
   late. When the seller lacks commitment to auction timing, bidders always
   initiate in equilibrium, resulting in earlier option exercise and higher
   welfare than auctions proscribing bidder initiation. Overall, auction
   timing modifies the distribution of the bidder valuations and has
   important implications for bidding strategies, auction design, and real
   outcomes.

AB Risk is an integral part of many economic decisions and is vitally
   important in finance. Despite extensive research on decision making
   under risk, little is known about how risks are actually perceived by
   financial professionals, the key players in global financial markets. In
   a large-scale survey experiment with 2,213 finance professionals and
   4,559 laypeople in nine countries representing similar to 50% of the
   world's population and more than 60% of the world's gross domestic
   product, we expose participants to return distributions with equal
   expected return, and we systematically vary the distributions' next
   three higher moments. Of these, skewness is the only moment that
   systematically affects financial professionals' perception of financial
   risk. Strikingly, variance does not influence risk perception, even
   though return volatility is the most common risk measure in finance in
   both academia and the industry. When testing other, compound risk
   measures, the probability to experience losses is the strongest
   predictor of what is perceived as being risky. Analyzing professionals'
   propensity to invest, skewness and loss probability also have strong
   predictive power, while volatility and kurtosis have some additional
   effect. Our results are very similar for laypeople, and they are robust
   across and within countries with different cultural backgrounds, as well
   as for different job fields of professionals.

AB We study a model where each competing firm has a target segment where it
   has full consumer information and can exercise personalized pricing, and
   consumers may engage in identity management to bypass the firm's attempt
   to price discriminate. In the absence of identity management, more
   consumer information intensifies competition because firms can
   effectively defend their turf through targeted personalized offers,
   thereby setting low public prices offered to nontargeted consumers. But
   the effect is mitigated when consumers are active in identity management
   because it raises the firm's cost of serving nontargeted consumers. When
   firms have sufficiently large and non-overlapping target segments,
   identity management can enable firms to extract full surplus from their
   targeted consumers through perfect price discrimination. Identity
   management can also induce firms not to serve consumers who are not
   targeted by either firm when the commonly nontargeted market segment is
   small. This results in a deadweight loss. Thus, identity management by
   consumers can benefit firms and lead to lower consumer surplus and lower
   social welfare. Our main insight continues to be valid when a fraction
   of consumers are active in identity management or when there is a cost
   of identity management. We also discuss the regulatory implications for
   the use of consumer information by firms as well as the implications for
   management.

AB Changing economic conditions over the past two decades have created

   process. One manifestation of these changes is an increased likelihood
   of analysts' issuing earnings forecasts for multiple firms on the same
   day. We identify this bundling property and show that bundling has
   increased steadily over time. We provide field evidence that the
   practice is a cost-saving measure, a natural by-product of analysts
   focusing on thematic research, and a reflection of forecast updating
   that occurs in advance of important events. Our empirical analyses show
   that bundled forecasts are less accurate, less bold, and less
   informative to investors than nonbundled forecasts. We also find that
   analysts who produce bundled forecasts provide valuable specialized
   services to their institutional clients. Our findings ultimately
   demonstrate that forecast bundling has important implications for the

AB Platform marketplaces can potentially steer buyers to certain sellers by
   recommending or guaranteeing those sellers. Money-back guarantees-which
   create a direct financial stake for the platform in seller
   performance-might be particularly effective at steering as they align
   buyer and platform interests in creating a good match. We report the
   results of an experiment in which a platform marketplace-an online labor
   market-guaranteed select sellers for treated buyers. The presence of a
   guarantee strongly steered buyers to these guaranteed sellers, but
   offering guarantees did not increase sales overall, suggesting financial
   risk was not determinative for the marginal buyer. This preference for
   guaranteed sellers was not the result of their lower financial risk, but
   rather because buyers viewed the platform's decision to guarantee as
   informative about relative seller quality. Indeed, a follow-up
   experiment showed that simply recommending the sellers that the platform
   would have guaranteed was equally effective at steering buyers.

AB Worker attrition is a costly and operationally disruptive challenge
   throughout the world. Although large bodies of research have documented
   drivers of attrition and the operational consequences of attrition,
   managers still lack an integrated approach to understanding attrition
   and making decisions to address it on a forward-going basis. To fill
   this need, we build a structural model that both captures the firm's
   decision to terminate a worker's employment (involuntary attrition) and
   uses an optimal stopping problem process to model a worker's decision to
   leave the firm (voluntary attrition). We then estimate the parameters of
   the model and conduct counterfactual analyses on the population of 1,118
   agents serving one client over 3 years for an Indian business process
   management company. Our model reveals a number of interesting findings.
   We find that supervisors have a strong impact on whether employees stay
   because they reshape the way that agents make their decisions. We also
   find that the impact of supervisors on agent attrition is more
   significant than the impact of salary. For example, increasing salary by
   20% decreases the total attrition level by 5%. However, if agents were
   managed by the best supervisors, among those that manage similar agents,
   the attrition rate decreases by 10%. Altogether, our paper contributes
   to the burgeoning literature on people operations and managerial
   practice.

AB We conjecture that for online retailers, experience-centric offline
   store formats do not simply expand market coverage, but rather, serve to
   significantly amplify future positive customer behaviors, both online
   and offline. We term this phenomenon "supercharging" and test our thesis
   using data from a digital-first men's apparel retailer and a pioneer of
   the so-called zero inventory store (ZIS) format-a small-footprint,
   experience-centric retail location that carries no inventory for
   immediate fulfillment, but fulfils orders via e-commerce. Using a
   risk-set matching approach, we calibrate our estimates on customers who
   are " treated," that is, have a ZIS experience, and matched with
   identical customers who shop online only. We find that after the ZIS
   experience, customers spend more, shop at a higher velocity, and are
   less likely to return items. The positive impact on returns is doubly
   virtuous as it is more pronounced for more tactile, higher-priced items,
   thus mitigating a key pain point of online retail. Furthermore, the ZIS
   shopping experience aids product discovery and brand attachment, causing
   sales to becomemore diffuse over a larger number of categories. Finally,
   we demonstrate that our results are robust to self-selection and
   potentially confounding effects of unobservable factors on the matched
   pairs of customers. Implications for retailing practice, including for
   legacy, offline-first retailers, are discussed.

AB Scholarly work seeking to understand academics' commercial activities
   often draws on abstract notions of the academic reward system and the
   representative scientist. Few scholars have examined whether and how
   scientists' motives to engage in commercial activities differ across
   fields. Similarly, efforts to understand academics' choices have focused
   on three self-interested motives-recognition, challenge, and
   money-ignoring the potential role of the desire to have an impact on
   others. Using panel data for a national sample of over 2,000 academics
   employed at U.S. institutions, we examine how the four motives are
   related to commercial activity measured by patenting. We find that all
   four motives are correlated with patenting, but these relationships
   differ systematically between the life sciences, physical sciences, and
   engineering. These field differences are consistent with differences
   across fields in the rewards from commercial activities as well as in
   the degree of overlap between traditional and commercializable research,
   which affects the opportunity costs of time spent away from
   "traditional" academic work. We discuss potential implications for
   policy makers, administrators, and managers as well as for future
   research on the scientific enterprise.

AB New Internet-based "sharing-economy" markets enable consumer-owners to
   rent out their durable goods to nonowners. We model such markets and
   explore their equilibria both in the short run, in which ownership
   decisions are fixed, and in the long run, in which ownership decisions
   can be changed. We find that sharing-economy markets always expand
   consumption and increase surplus, but may increase or decrease
   ownership. Regardless, ownership is decoupled from individual
   preferences in the long run, as the rental rates and the purchase prices
   of goods become equal. If there are costs of bringing unused capacity to
   the market, they are partially passed through, creating a bias toward
   ownership. To test our theoretical work empirically, we conduct a survey
   of consumers, finding broad support for our modeling assumptions. The
   survey also allows us to offer a partial decomposition of the
   bring-to-market costs, based on attributes that make a good more or less
   amenable to being shared.

AB We study the role of vertical differentiation in the adoption of LEED
   (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design), amultitier environmental
   building certification system. Our identification strategy relies on the
   timing of adoption and shows that builders seek to differentiate from
   each other by choosing a different certification level from previously
   certified buildings. A common concern in this framework is that
   mean-reverting behavior could be mistaken for differentiation. We
   develop a new method for establishing the importance of strategic
   interactions based on simulating fromamodel with independent choice and
   unobserved heterogeneity, and showing that such a model cannot generate
   the level of interaction that we observe. Finally, we estimate a model
   that incorporates both differentiation incentives and correlated
   market-level unobservables and use our estimates from this model to
   simulate the impact of reducing the number of LEED tiers from four to
   two. The simulations indicate that environmental investments depend on
   the location of the threshold between tiers.

AB We develop a model of oligopolistic firms that produce partially
   differentiated products and generate pollution as a byproduct. We
   analyze and compare two types of pollution regulation: Cap-and-Trade and
   Taxes. Firms can respond to regulation by any combination of pollution
   abatement, output reduction, emissions trading (under Cap-and-Trade), or
   payment of pollution taxes (under Taxes). We prove that well-chosen
   regulation can, besides reducing pollution, actually improve firms'
   profits relative to laissez-faire (unregulated markets), and
   simultaneously improve consumer surplus and welfare. Thus, regulation
   Pareto-dominates laissez-faire under a wide range of plausible
   conditions. These results are driven by an unintended consequence of
   pollution regulation: Competing firms can use the regulation to tacitly
   (and credibly) collude to reduce production and improve their profits.
   We show that the degree of competition plays a critical role in
   determining the economic consequences of pollution regulation. Our
   results suggest that the regulator's primary consideration should be the
   impact of regulation on consumers rather than producers.

AB We study the value of commitment in a business environment that is both
   competitive and uncertain, in which two firms face stochastic demands
   and compete in positioning and repositioning. If the future demand tends
   to disperse or the demand uncertainty is sufficiently large, one firm
   chooses rigidity (i.e., commits not to change its positions), and the
   other chooses flexibility (i.e., to reposition freely). We find that a
   firm's rigidity can benefit not only itself, but also its flexible
   rival. When uncertainty is larger, rigidity becomes more valuable
   relative to flexibility. These results arise because the asymmetric
   equilibrium generates two collective gains in addition to the usual
   individual gain (in terms of competitive advantages) accrued to the
   committing firm. A firm's rigid repositioning can soften competition and
   generate a commitment value, and the other firm's flexible repositioning
   generates an option value. Both values then spill over to competitors
   within the ecosystem. These results suggest that, when firms compete
   under uncertainty, commitment and options are valuable not only for the
   party that is making the choice, but also for all competing parties
   collectively. Commitment value and option value do not have to be
   mutually exclusive; they can coexist and even strengthen each other
   through unilateral commitment, which achieves the best of both
   strategies.

AB Developing marketing campaigns for a new product or a new target
   population is challenging because of the scarcity of relevant historical
   data. Building on dynamic Bayesian learning, a sequential optimization
   assists in creating new data points within a finite number of learning
   phases. This procedure identifies effective advertisement design
   elements as well as customer segments that maximize the expected outcome
   of the final marketing campaign. In this paper, the marketing campaign
   performance is modeled by a multiplicative advertising exposure model
   with Poisson arrivals. The intensity of the Poisson process is a
   function of the marketing campaign features. A forward-looking
   measurement policy is formulated to maximize the expected improvement in
   the value of information in each learning phase. A computationally
   efficient approach is proposed that consists of solving a sequence of
   mixed-integer linear optimization problems. The performance of the
   optimal learning policy over a set of benchmark policies is evaluated
   using examples inspired from the property and casualty insurance
   industry. Further extensions of the model are discussed.

   handles general reinsurance contracts, such as typical excess of loss
   contracts. We show that simpler models existing in the literature-namely
   proportional reinsurance-greatly underestimate contagion risk. We
   characterize the fixed points of our model and develop efficient
   algorithms to compute contagion with guarantees on convergence and speed
   under conditions on network structure. We characterize exotic cases of
   problematic graph structure and nonlinearities, which cause network
   effects to dominate the overall payments in the system. Last, we apply
   our model to data on real-world reinsurance networks. Our simulations
   demonstrate the following. (1) Reinsurance networks face extreme
   sensitivity to parameters. A firm can be wildly uncertain about its
   losses even under small network uncertainty. (2) Our sensitivity results
   reveal a new incentive for firms to cooperate to prevent fraud, because
   even small cases of fraud can have outsized effect on the losses across
   the network. (3) Nonlinearities from excess of loss contracts obfuscate
   risks and can cause excess costs in a real-world system.

   This negative relation is a result of the current decision to invest and

AB Limited external financing creates a hedging motive that distorts

   through a dynamic model with endogenous collateral constraints. The
   hedging motive can be broken into three components: expected future

   constrained firms behave as if averse to transitory fluctuations in net
   worth, they can endogenously pursue increased exposure to both
   persistent factors that predict future productivity and fluctuations in
   credit tightness. The most constrained firms abstain from financial
   hedging, while still distorting capital-allocation decisions, thereby
   influencing firm- level volatility. These distortions contribute to a
   potential explanation for the negative cross- sectional relationship

AB How individuals manage, organize, and complete their tasks is central to
   operations management. Recent research in operations focuses on how
   under conditions of increasing workload individuals can decrease their
   service time, up to a point, to complete work more quickly. As the
   number of tasks increases, however, workers may also manage their
   workload by a different process-task selection. Drawing on research on
   workload, individual discretion, and behavioral decision making, we
   theorize and then test that under conditions of increased workload,
   individuals may choose to complete easier tasks to manage their load. We
   label this behavior task completion preference (TCP). Using six years of
   data from a hospital emergency department, we find that physicians
   engage in TCP, with implications for their performance. Specifically,
   TCP helps physicians manage variance in service times; however, although
   it initially appears to improve shift-level throughput volume, after
   adjusting for the complexity of the work completed, TCP is related to
   worse throughput. Moreover, we find that engaging in easier tasks
   compared with hard ones is related to lower learning in service times.
   We then turn to the laboratory to replicate conceptually the short-term
   task selection effect under increased workload and show that it occurs
   because of both fatigue and the sense of progress individuals get from
   task completion. These findings provide another mechanism for the
   workload-speedup effect from the literature. We also discuss
   implications for both the research and the practice of operations in
   building systems to help people succeed.

   the significant common prior assumption. We study the design of optimal
   prior-independent selling mechanisms: buyers do not have any information
   about their competitors, and the seller does not know the distribution
   of values but only knows a general class to which it belongs. Anchored
   on the canonical model of buyers with independent and identically
   distributed values, we analyze a competitive ratio objective in which
   the seller attempts to optimize the worst-case fraction of revenues
   garnered compared with those of an oracle with knowledge of the
   distribution. We characterize properties of optimal mechanisms and in
   turn establish fundamental impossibility results through upper bounds on
   the maximin ratio. By also deriving lower bounds on the maximin ratio,
   we are able to crisply characterize the optimal performance for a
   spectrum of families of distributions. In particular, our results imply
   that a second price auction is an optimal mechanism when the seller only
   knows that the distribution of buyers has a monotone nondecreasing
   hazard rate, and it guarantees at least 71.53% of oracle revenues
   against any distribution within this class. Furthermore, a second price
   auction is near optimal when the class of admissible distributions is
   that of those with nondecreasing virtual value function (a.k.a.
   regular). Under this class, it guarantees a fraction of 50% of oracle
   revenues, and no mechanism can guarantee more than 55.6%.

AB The transition of the advertising market from traditional media to the
   internet has induced a proliferation of marketing agencies specialized
   in bidding in the auctions that are used to sell ad space on the web. We
   analyze how collusive bidding can emerge from bid delegation to a common
   marketing agency and how this can undermine the revenues and allocative
   efficiency of both the generalized second-price auction (GSP, used by
   Google, Microsoft Bing, and Yahoo!) and the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
   mechanism (used by Facebook). We find that despite its well-known
   susceptibility to collusion, the VCG mechanism outperforms the GSP
   auction in terms of both revenues and efficiency.

   obtained after controlling for investor-year fixed effects and date
   fixed effects, as well as local weather conditions. More strikingly,
   abnormal trade performance decreases monotonically with the levels
   indicating the severity of air pollution. Furthermore, we find evidence
   suggesting that air pollution makes investors more susceptible to the

   results highlight a hitherto-unexplored cost that ambient air pollution
   imposes on stock market investors.

AB We consider the problem of A-B testing when the impact of the treatment
   is marred by a large number of covariates. Randomization can be highly
   inefficient in such settings, and thus we consider the problem of
   optimally allocating test subjects to either treatment with a view to
   maximizing the precision of our estimate of the treatment effect. Our
   main contribution is a tractable algorithm for this problem in the
   online setting, where subjects arrive, and must be assigned,
   sequentially, with covariates drawn from an elliptical distribution with
   finite second moment. We further characterize the gain in precision
   afforded by optimized allocations relative to randomized allocations,
   and show that this gain grows large as the number of covariates grows.
   Our dynamic optimization framework admits several generalizations that
   incorporate important operational constraints such as the consideration
   of selection bias, budgets on allocations, and endogenous stopping
   times. In a set of numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method
   simultaneously offers better statistical efficiency and less selection
   bias than state-of-the-art competing biased coin designs.

   reported significant productivity gains from introduction of new
   technologies. However, other more traditional, labor-intensive
   industries are lagging behind. We use granular data to examine the
   impact of a customer-facing technology (a tabletop device that
   facilitates the table service process) on the check size and meal
   duration aspects of restaurant performance. The restaurant chain in our
   study implemented tabletop devices in a staggered manner, offering us a
   quasi-experimental setting in which to apply a difference-in-difference
   technique and identify the causal effect of the technology. We find that
   the tabletop technology is likely to improve average sales per check by
   approximately 1% (95% confidence interval is from 0.8% to 1.02%), and
   reduce the meal duration by close to 10% (95% confidence interval ranges
   from -9.94% to -9.54%). The combination of these two effects increases
   the sales per minute or sales productivity by approximately 11%. Various
   robustness checks of our empirical strategy and post hoc analyses find
   that tabletop technology allows low-ability waiters to improve their
   performance more significantly than high-ability waiters. In addition,
   the technology does not change the staffing level. Overall, our results
   indicate great potential for introducing tabletop technology in a large
   service industry that currently lacks digitalization.

AB We consider a dynamic pricing problem with an unknown and discontinuous
   demand function. There is a seller who dynamically sets the price of a
   product over a multiperiod time horizon. The expected demand for the
   product is a piecewise continuous and parametric function of the charged
   price, allowing for possibly multiple discontinuity points. The seller
   initially knows neither the locations of the discontinuity points nor
   the parameters of the demand function but can infer them by observing
   stochastic demand realizations over time. We measure the seller's
   performance by the revenue loss relative to a clairvoyant who knows the
   underlying demand function with certainty. We construct a dynamic
   estimation-and-pricing policy that accounts for demand discontinuities,
   derive the convergence rates of discontinuity- and parameter-estimation
   errors under this policy, and prove that it achieves near-optimal
   revenue performance. We also extend our analysis to the cases of
   time-varying demand discontinuities and inventory constraints.

AB This paper studies whether and how Big-4 firms provide higher-quality
   audits than non-Big-4 firms. Specifically, we first examine a Big-4
   effect and then explore three sources of the Big-4 effect. To test the
   Big-4 effect, we use a unique data set of individual audit partners for
   a large sample of private companies and a novel research design
   exploiting the fact that auditees may follow the auditor who switches
   affiliation from a non-Big-4 firm to a Big-4 firm. Thus, we compare
   audit quality and audit fees of the same partner-auditee pairs before
   and after the switch. The results show that the Big-4 effect exists in
   the private-firm segment. More important, we find evidence for three
   sources of the Big-4 effect. First, Big-4 firms are able to recruit
   non-Big-4 partners who deliver higher audit quality than other non-Big-4
   partners in the preswitch period. Second, enhanced learning has taken
   place after the switch. Third, the increased audit quality can also be
   attributed to stronger incentives/monitoring. These are new findings to

   reduce this tension, disciplining security lender competition and
   allowing for real-time settlement. Optimal penalties resemble put
   options on the lending market: they protect traders against high
   settlement costs but do not eliminate failures to deliver. Mandating
   automatic security borrowing to prevent failures to deliver triggers a
   toxic settlement rat race to lock in low borrowing costs.

AB A core challenge in studying the real return on artist' work is the
   extreme difficulty accessing private records from when an artwork was
   first sold and thus relying on public auction data. In addition, artists
   do not typically receive proceeds after the initial sale. This paper,
   for the first time, uses archivally sourced primary market records to
   model returns on art and introduces a novel fractional equity structure
   for artists. We first model what would happen if the American artists
   Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg had retained 10% equity in their
   work when it was first sold. Second, we model a portfolio return using
   data from the Betty Parsons Gallery and the Green Gallery. To add a
   portfolio analysis to the performance of "star" artists, we model the
   galleries as a fund invested in all of artworks sold, using auction
   sales as the realization event. We find that the individual Johns and
   Rauschenberg works would have vastly outperformed equities markets. The
   gallery portfolio still substantially outperforms the S&P, even
   including 20% transaction costs. Beyond the art market, our larger
   conceptual framework for retained fractional equity has broad
   implications for compensation of early-stage creative work in any field
   and for potential applications of blockchain technology.

AB The World Health Organization seeks effective ways to alert its member
   states about global pandemics. Motivated by this challenge, we study a
   public agency's problem of designing warning policies to mitigate
   potential disasters that occur with advance notice. The agency privately
   receives early information about recurring harmful events and issues
   warnings to induce an uninformed stakeholder to take preemptive actions.
   The agency's decision to issue a warning critically depends on its
   reputation, which we define as the stakeholder's belief regarding the
   accuracy of the agency's information. The agency faces then a trade-off
   between eliciting a proper response today and maintaining its reputation
   to elicit responses to future events. We formulate this problem as a
   dynamic Bayesian persuasion game, which we solve in closed form. We find
   that the agency sometimes strategically misrepresents its advance
   information about a current threat to cultivate its future reputation.
   When its reputation is sufficiently low, the agency downplays the risk
   and actually downplays more as its reputation improves. By contrast,
   when its reputation is high, the agency sometimes exaggerates the threat
   and exaggerates more as its reputation deteriorates. Only when its
   reputation is moderate does the agency send warning messages that fully
   disclose its private information. Our study suggests a plausible and
   novel rationale for some of the false alarms or omissions observed in
   practice. We further test the robustness of our findings to imperfect
   advance information, disasters without advance notice, and heterogeneous
   receivers.

   at the corresponding integer degree has a negative lower bound. By
   extending the concept of "uniform risk aversion" previously proposed in
   the literature to high-order risk preferences, we interpret the
   fractionalized degree parameter as a benchmark individual relative to
   whom all considered individuals are uniformly no less risk averse in the
   lottery choices. The equivalent distribution conditions for the newrules
   are provided, and the fractional degree "increase in risk" is defined.
   We generalize the previously defined notion of "risk apportionment" and

   arrivals can take into account such user-generated information when
   deciding whether to go to the service facility. We perform pairwise
   comparisons of the shared, full, and no queue-length information
   structures in terms of social welfare. Perhaps surprisingly, we show
   that the shared queue-length information may provide greater social
   welfare than full queue-length information when the hassle cost of the
   customers entering the service facility falls into some ranges, and the
   shared and full queue-length information structures always generate
   greater social welfare than no queuelength information. Therefore, the

   lead to as much, or even greater, social welfare as the continuous
   stream of real-time queue-length information disclosure and always
   generates greater social welfare than no queue-length information
   disclosure at all. These results imply that a little shared queue-length
   information-inaccurate and lagged-can go a long way and that it may be
   more socially beneficial to encourage the sharing of user-generated
   information among customers than to provide them with full real-time

AB Do people have an irrational dislike for risk? People pay less for
   uncertain prospects than their worst possible outcomes, and researchers
   have proposed that this effect occurs because people strongly dislike
   risk. We challenge this proposition across seven studies. Though people
   seem to irrationally dislike risky prospects when preference is assessed
   with open-ended pricing measures, such as willingness-to-pay, people
   display rational responses toward risky prospects when preference is
   assessed using rating measures, such as ratings of expected enjoyment.
   This discrepancy does not seemto arise because these measures (a) focus
   on different components of the uncertainty, (b) rely on contextdependent
   versus normed scales, or (c) involve voluntarily opting into an
   uncertain situation. Accordingly, we find that people also display
   rational responses toward risky prospects with time measures (i.e.,
   willingness-to-wait and anticipated time usage) and choice. We discuss
   alternative explanations and crucial implications of our effects for
   both theory and application.

   costs even stickier in SOEs while having little effect in non-SOEs. Such
   effects are stronger in regions with weak market institutions and during

   price. Combining experimental and market data, this paper examines
   whether such models can be improved by incorporating reference-point
   adjustment. Using real stock prices over horizons from 6 months to 5
   years, experimental evidence demonstrates that a number of salient
   points in the prior share price path are key determinants of the
   reference point, in addition to the purchase price. Market data testing
   is then undertaken by using the CGO model. We show that composite CGO
   variables, created by using a mix of salient points with weights
   determined in the experiment, have greater predictive power than the
   traditional CGO variable in both cross-sectional U.S. equity-return
   analysis and when analyzing the performance of double-sorted portfolios.
   In addition, future trading volume is more sensitive to changes in the
   composite CGO variables than to the traditional CGO, further emphasizing
   the importance of adjusting reference points.

   firms receiving greater media attention engage more in IR activities. In
   addition, firms domiciled in countries with weaker legal protections for
   investors and poorer disclosure standards, those cross-listed in the
   stock markets that are outperforming, and those with high global media
   visibility invest in greater global outreach efforts with IR activities.
   Firms' IR efforts to investors worldwide are associated with higher
   Tobin's q valuation ratios. We interpret our findings in the context of
   theories and existing evidence on the role of asymmetric information and
   governance problems in global markets.

AB Platform firms' success depends on complementary innovation. This paper
   studies the relation between opportunities for interfirm exchange and
   complementary innovation. An empirical study of a sample of app
   developer firms attending Apple's 2016 Worldwide Developers Conference
   suggests three findings. First, the opportunity to exchange stimulated
   innovation in the formofmajor app updates that received positive
   consumer feedback. Second, the effects were more pronounced for older
   and larger firms, potentially because these firms have more experience
   and resources to leverage exchanges and safeguard against knowledge
   spillovers. Third, part of the effects may be attributed to learning and
   collaborations.

AB YMany platform strategies focus on indirect network effects between
   sellers through platform expansion. In this paper, we show sellers on
   the console video game platform generate a positive intertemporal
   spillover effect and expand the demand for other sellers, holding the
   set of platform adopters fixed. We propose a novel identification
   strategy that leverages exogenous variation in the release timing of
   games exclusively available on a console platform, and examine how this
   variation affects the sales of games available on both platforms. We
   find a sizable intertemporal demand spillover effect between games: A 1%
   increase in total copies sold on a platform leads to a 0.153% increase
   in the sales of other games in the next month (i.e., an elasticity of
   0.153). Additional analysis suggests this demand spillover effect is
   reminiscent of habit formation on the consumer side, in that past
   purchases keep end users active on the platform. Our finding provides a
   potential explanation for recent platform sales events and subscription
   services that provide free games to consumers every month.

   messages than money, whereas men and those in less altruistic cultures
   are more motivated by money than social impact. The estimates are not
   driven by differences in the type of company, its size, or other

   differences in the underlying motivations of innovative entrepreneurs

AB Charity organizations differ in their practice of offering donors the
   option to earmark their contribution: allowing donors to select the
   project in which their money should be invested. This paper presents two
   studies that provide the first empirical evidence on the appeal of such
   earmarking. The empirical basis of Study 1 is a unique data set
   consisting of 7,383 potential donors from 25 countries who participated
   in a randomized survey experiment. First, we find that the willingness
   to donate is significantly higher when earmarking is allowed. Second, we
   find that the effect of earmarking substantially differs in magnitude
   across countries. Third, we identify two cross-cultural interactions.
   Specifically, earmarking is less effective in countries that score lower
   on autonomy relative to embeddedness and in those scoring lower on
   egalitarianism relative to hierarchy. Fourth, we find that the
   earmarking effect is driven mainly by the activation of more donors and
   not by increases in the amounts that donors contribute. Study 2 is a
   follow-up experiment that replicates the basic earmarking effect,
   addresses limitations of our cross-cultural study, and sheds some
   preliminary light on the effect's underlying process. We find that
   earmarking options increase potential donors' perceptions of being able
   to make specific impact and also that this sense of agency helps us to
   understand an individual's increased willingness to donate.

AB This paper analyzes price comparison platforms' equilibrium design of
   their search environments, namely the order under which firms are
   displayed (having a prominent firm or listing firms randomly) and how
   much price complexity firms are able to use. It is found that (1) the
   possibility to obfuscate amplifies firms' willingness to pay for the
   prominent position; (2) when platforms sell prominence, they optimally
   allow for more obfuscation than they would if they were to display firms
   randomly; and (3) if platforms are sufficiently differentiated, they
   find it optimal to sell prominence. Thus, platforms exploit their market
   power over consumers by implementing a prominent position and allowing
   for large levels of obfuscation. This paper also finds that in
   equilibrium, there is tension between platforms and firms regarding how
   much price complexity is used: firms would like to use even more
   obfuscation than what the platform allows, so the platform must monitor
   firms' prices to make sure that they are not excessively complex.

AB Entrepreneurial teams assign equity positions in their start-ups using a
   term sheet that details equity splits and the conditions for being
   granted those splits. The design of equity split agreements has
   attracted considerable attention in the entrepreneurial community, with
   no convergence on a single preferred contract form. This paper
   experimentally examines the effectiveness of different contractual
   arrangements, focusing in particular on the effects of contract form and
   contracting timing on founder effort and on the value of the venture.
   Our results suggest that performance improves with the incentive
   strength of the contract, but they question the conventional logic that
   this effect is causal. Instead, we suggest a novel causal sequence.
   Rather than the contract form being the primitive and the behavior the
   derived consequence, our results suggest the reverse. The differences in
   contract performance are driven primarily by the sorting of high
   contributors into nonequal contracts and of low contributors into equal
   contracts; that is, equal contracts are bad for team performance not
   because of their incentive strength but because of the founder types
   that adopt them. Taken together, these results suggest that both
   investors and founders should pay as much (or more) attention to
   personality type as they do to contract form.

AB Compensation systems have rapidly been shifting away from a fixed wage
   contractual payment basis. Many companies today are creating incentive
   compensation contracts to reward hard-working employees for jobs done
   well. Profit sharing ("sharing compensation contract") and target with
   bonus ("target compensation contract") are two common performance-based
   compensation contracts prevalent in business. We theoretically and
   behaviorally study the sharing and target compensation contracts in an
   operational context where a firm sets the parameters of the compensation
   contracts and a store manager, after observing the compensation contract
   offered to him, chooses his effort level (unobservable by the firm) and
   makes ordering decisions for the store. Our experimental data suggest
   systematic deviations from the theoretical benchmark and reveal
   behavioral promise and pitfalls under the two compensation contracts. In
   particular, the store manager is more willing to exert high effort under
   the target contract all else being equal. However, the store manager is
   also more likely to punish the firm for perceived "unfair" offers by
   submitting an extremely low order quantity. We find that bounded
   rationality plays an important role in driving a higher effort rate
   under the target contract than the sharing contract. We introduce a new
   formulation of the fairness concerns, which is referred to as by-state
   fairness, where individuals, rather than considering whether the
   expected profits received are fair, consider the fairness in the
   potential realized outcomes. This new formulation explains why managers
   are more likely to order very little to punish the firm under the target
   contract. In addition, we conduct validation experiments to verify our
   behavioral explanation.

AB We consider the problem faced by a firm that receives highly
   differentiated products in an online fashion. The firm needs to price
   these products to sell them to its customer base. Products are described
   by vectors of features and the market value of each product is linear in
   the values of the features. The firm does not initially know the values
   of the different features, but can learn the values of the features
   based on whether products were sold at the posted prices in the past.
   This model is motivated by applications such as online marketplaces,
   online flash sales, and loan pricing. We first consider a
   multidimensional version of binary search over polyhedral sets and show
   that it has a worst-case regret which is exponential in the dimension of
   the feature space. We then propose a modification of the prior algorithm
   where uncertainty sets are replaced by their Lowner-John ellipsoids. We
   show that this algorithm has a worst-case regret which is quadratic in
   the dimension of the feature space and logarithmic in the time horizon.
   We also show how to adapt our algorithm to the case where valuations are
   noisy. Finally, we present computational experiments to illustrate the
   performance of our algorithm.

AB What can be done to combat political misinformation? One prominent
   intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories
   that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we
   demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a
   warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to
   get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate.
   With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can
   lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers),
   we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in
   perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition
   (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed
   the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused
   untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In
   Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of
   decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We
   also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines-which
   removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been
   checked or have been verified-eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses,
   the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of
   motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the
   policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation-a challenge that is
   particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce
   misinformation than it is to debunk it.

   the extent of competition among senders, whether receivers are wary of
   senders collecting personalized data, and whether firms are able to
   personalize prices. We show how both senders and receivers can benefit
   from selective disclosure. Privacy laws requiring senders to obtain
   consent to acquire personal information that enables such selective
   disclosure increases receiver welfare if and only if there is little or
   asymmetric competition among senders, if receivers are unwary, and if

AB Lacking credible rule-enforcement mechanisms to punish misconduct,
   existing reward-based crowdfunding platforms can leave backers exposed
   to two risks: entrepreneurs may run away with backers' money (funds
   misappropriation), and product specifications may be misrepresented
   (performance opacity). We show that each of these risks can materially
   impact crowdfunding efficiency, and, when jointly present, they interact
   with each other in ways that can dampen or, more worryingly, amplify
   their individual adverse effects. To mitigate these risks, we propose
   two mechanisms based on deferred payments. The first involves stopping
   the campaign once the funding goal is reached and servicing any unmet
   demand in the aftermarket. The second involves escrowing any funds
   raised in excess of the goal, as insurance for backers. We show that
   early stopping dominates escrow and boosts platform revenues. Pairing
   these deferred payment designs with (costly) performance verification
   contingencies can bring additional gains, but doing so can flip their
   relative performance, with escrow coming out on top. Overall, by
   accounting for different timing (pre- versus post-campaign) and
   enforcement rules (mandatory versus optional) of the verification
   contingencies, we analyze a total of 10 different designs and show that
   two of them dominate: the early stopping design and the escrow design
   with mandatory ex-post verification. We conclude by providing
   recommendations for which design works best under different conditions
   and exploring the potential of crowdsourced performance checks.

AB We study how three matching institutions, differing in how relationships
   are dissolved, affect cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma and
   how cooperation rates are affected by the presence of a reputation
   mechanism. Although cooperation is theoretically sustainable under all
   institutions, we show experimentally that cooperation rates are lowest
   under random matching, highest under fixed matching, and intermediate in
   a flexible matching institution, where subjects have the option to
   dissolve relationships. Our results also suggest important interactions
   between the matching institution and reputation mechanism. Under both
   the random matching and flexible matching institutions, both subjective
   (based on subjects' ratings) and objective (based on subjects' actions)
   reputation mechanisms lead to substantial increases in cooperative
   behavior. However, under fixed matching, only the subjective reputation
   mechanism leads to higher cooperation. We argue that these differences
   are due to different reputation mechanisms being more forgiving of early
   deviations from cooperation under certain matching institutions, which
   gives subjects the ability to learn the value of cooperation rather than
   getting stuck with a bad reputation and, consequently, uncooperative
   relationships.

AB We study the role of ad networks in the online advertising market. Our
   baseline model considers two publishers that can outsource the sale of
   their ad inventories to an ad network, in a market where consumers and
   advertisers multi-home. The ad network increases total advertising
   revenue by tracking consumers across outlets and reduces competition
   between publishers by centralizing the sale of ads. Consequently,
   outsourcing to the ad network benefits the publishers, but may penalize
   the advertisers. We show that the ad network's ability to track
   consumers may either expand or reduce the provision of ads, depending on
   consumers' preferences for the publishers and how advertisers use
   tracking information. Specifically, tracking is more likely to expand
   (respectively, reduce) the provision of ads when consumers' preferences
   for the publishers are positively (respectively, negatively) correlated.
   Tracking is also more likely to expand (respectively, reduce) the
   provision of ads when advertisers use tracking information to cap the
   frequency of impressions (respectively, target specific consumers).
   Furthermore, we study the implications of consumers' choice to block
   tracking. Generally, blocking negatively impacts the advertising
   industry by making ad allocation less effective. Blocking also entails
   an externality on consumers, which is negative when tracking reduces the
   provision of ads. Given these conditions, regulatory restrictions on
   tracking may reduce consumer surplus as well as advertising revenue.
   These findings contrast with the presumption that regulation should make
   it easier for consumers to avoid tracking. We propose further
   extensions, including competing ad networks, more than two publishers,
   and networks that do not sell ads, but only tracking information to the
   advertisers.

AB In this paper, we provide an axiomatic foundation for the value-based
   version of the drift diffusion model (DDM) of Ratcliff, a successful
   model that describes two-alternative speeded decisions between consumer
   goods. Our axioms present a test for model misspecification and connect
   the externally observable properties of choice with an important
   neurophysiologic account of how choice is internally implemented. We
   then extend our axiomatic analysis to multialternative choice under time
   pressure. In a nutshell, we show that binary DDM comparisons of the
   alternatives, paired with Markovian exploration of the consideration
   set, approximately lead to softmaximization.

AB We propose a model for word-of-mouth (WoM) management where a firm has
   two tools at hand: offering referral rewards and offering a free
   contract. Current customers' incentives to engage in WoM can affect the
   contracting problem of a firm in the presence of positive externalities
   of users. Formally, we consider a classic Maskin-Riley contracting
   problem for the receiver of WoM where the firm can pay the senders
   referral rewards and a sender experiences positive externalities if the
   receiver adopts. A free contract can incentivize WoM because the higher
   adoption probability increases the expected externalities that the
   sender receives. We characterize the optimal incentive scheme and show
   when the two tools serve as substitutes and complements to each other
   depending on whether the market is niche and whether the product is
   social. We show that offering a free contract is optimal only if the
   fraction of premium users in the population is small, which is
   consistent with the observation that companies that successfully offer
   "freemium" contracts oftentimes have a high percentage of free users.

AB We consider an inventory control problem with multiple products and
   stockout substitution. The firm knows neither the primary demand
   distribution for each product nor the customers' substitution
   probabilities between products a priori, and it needs to learn such
   information from sales data on the fly. One challenge in this problem is
   that the firm cannot distinguish between primary demand and substitution
   (overflow) demand from the sales data of any product, and lost sales are
   not observable. To circumvent these difficulties, we construct learning
   stages with each stage consisting of a cyclic exploration scheme and a
   benchmark exploration interval. The benchmark interval allows us to
   isolate the primary demand information from the sales data, and then
   this information is used against the sales data from the cyclic
   exploration intervals to estimate substitution probabilities. Because
   raising the inventory level helps obtain primary demand information but
   hinders substitution demand information, inventory decisions have to be
   carefully balanced to learn them together. We show that our learning
   algorithm admits a worst-case regret rate that (almost) matches the
   theoretical lower bound, and numerical experiments demonstrate that the
   algorithm performs very well.

   the number of entrants is disclosed between the stages. Theory predicts
   more entry for lower omega and the levels of entry and aggregate
   investment to be independent of disclosure in all cases. We find

   we find no effect of disclosure when omega is low but a strong positive
   effect of disclosure when omega is high. The difference is driven by
   substantial overinvestment in contests with a small, publicly known
   number of players contrasted by more restrained investment in contests
   in which the number of players is uncertain and may be small. The
   behavior under disclosure is explained by a combination of joy of

AB Providing patients with timely care from the appropriate unit involves
   both correct clinical evaluation of patient needs and making admission
   decisions to effectively manage a unit with limited capacity in the face
   of stochastic patient arrivals and lengths of stay. We study human
   decision behavior in the latter operations management task. Using
   behavioral models and controlled experiments in which physicians and
   MTurk workers manage a simulated hospital unit, we identify cognitive
   and environmental factors that drive systematic admission decision bias.
   We report on two main findings. First, seemingly innocuous "occupancy
   information hurdles" (e.g., having to type a password to view current
   occupancy) can cause a chain of events that leads physicians to maintain
   systematically lower unit utilization. Specifically, these hurdles cause
   physicians to make most admission decisions without checking the current
   unit occupancy. Then-between the times that they do check-physicians
   underestimate the number of available beds when occupancy increases from
   admissions are more salient than occupancy decreases from discharges.
   Second, decision-related random error or "noise" leads to higher- or
   lowerthan-optimal utilization of hospital units in predictable patterns,
   depending on the system parameters. We provide evidence that these
   patterns are due to some settings providing more opportunity for
   physicians to mistakenly admit patients and other settings that provide
   more opportunity to mistakenly reject patients. These findings help
   identify when and why clinicians are likely to make inefficient
   decisions because of human cognitive limitations and suggest mitigation
   strategies to help hospital units improve their capacity management.

AB Although significant research has examined how technology can intensify
   racial and other outgroup biases, limited work has investigated the role
   information systems can play in abating them. Racial biases are
   particularly worrisome in healthcare, where underrepresented minorities
   suffer disparities in access to care, quality of care, and clinical
   outcomes. In this paper, we examine the role clinical decision support
   systems (CDSS) play in attenuating systematic biases among black
   patients, relative to white patients, in rates of amputation and
   revascularization stemming from diabetes mellitus. Using a panel of
   inpatient data and a difference-in-difference approach, results suggest
   that CDSS adoption significantly shrinks disparities in amputation rates
   across white and black patients-with no evidence that this change is
   simply delaying eventual amputations. Results suggest that this effect
   is driven by changes in treatment care protocols that match patients to
   appropriate specialists, rather than altering within physician decision
   making. These findings highlight the role information systems and
   digitized patient care can play in promoting unbiased decision making by
   structuring and standardizing care procedures.

AB We examine a model of Cournot competition with congestion motivated by
   recent policy to allow commercial sharing of wireless spectrum that is
   assigned to other users such as government agencies. A key feature of
   such spectrum is that it is intermittently available because of the
   incumbent user's activity. In our model, wireless service providers
   (SPs) compete for a common pool of customers using their own proprietary
   (exclusively licensed) bands of spectrum along with access to an
   additional intermittent band. When the intermittent band is unavailable,
   any traffic carried on that band must be shifted to the proprietary
   bands. Customers are sensitive to both the price they pay and the
   average congestion they experience across the bands of spectrum from
   which they receive service. We compare two different access policies for
   this intermittent band: one in which it is open to all SPs and one in
   which it is licensed to a single SP. We also allow the band to be
   divided into multiple subbands where each subband is either open or
   licensed. We characterize trade-offs between social welfare and consumer
   welfare that depend on the choice of different access policies and
   assignments of subbands to SPs. These can involve subtle issues related
   to the ability of a larger SP to make more efficient use of intermittent
   spectrum and the increase in competition by assigning more spectrum to
   smaller SPs.

   decisions and their incentives to help or collaborate with each other.
   We then characterize the firm's optimal sales force compensation scheme

   results show that the work environment-which includes such aspects as
   demand uncertainty, correlation across sales territories, and the
   possibility of help/collaboration-plays a significant role in the firm's
   compensation and wage transparency decisions. In particular, wage
   transparency is more likely to benefit the firm when demand uncertainty
   is low, sales outcomes are positively correlated across different sales
   territories, and sales agents can collaborate at low cost. We find that,
   contrary to conventional wisdom, social comparisons need not reduce

AB Prospect Theory's value function suggests that investors would be risk
   averse in the gain domain and risk seeking in the loss domain-that is,
   the reflection effect. However, most of the experimental evidence relies
   on choice tasks in the gain domain between prospects marked in dollar
   amounts and considering non-mixed lotteries. There is not much work that
   examines environments with properties typical in investment decisions
   where the task is fund allocation involving mixed lotteries with
   outcomes being rate of return. The recent negative deposit rates in
   Europe demonstrate the importance of this question and, in particular,
   understanding investment decisions in the loss domain. This paper fills
   this gap by using a series of laboratory experiments mimicking these
   properties of investment decisions with a range of investment amounts
   and with the money to invest either being earned and literally on the
   table or not. Yet, no matter the settings, we find no evidence for the
   reflection effect in investment, and behavior is most consistent with
   maximizing expected return. This holds regardless of the language used
   (abstract or not), whether we use a two- or a three-state lottery,
   whether the task is continuous rather than discrete, or the risky
   portfolio is a mixed lottery.

AB In the school choice market, where scarce public school seats are
   assigned to students, a key operational issue is how to reassign seats
   that are vacated after an initial round of centralized assignment.
   Practical solutions to the reassignment problem must be simple to
   implement, truthful, and efficient while also alleviating costly student
   movement between schools. We propose and axiomatically justify a class
   of reassignment mechanisms, the permuted lottery deferred acceptance
   (PLDA) mechanisms. Our mechanisms generalize the commonly used deferred
   acceptance (DA) school choice mechanism to a two-round setting and
   retain its desirable incentive and efficiency properties. School choice
   systems typically run DA with a lottery number assigned to each student
   to break ties in school priorities. We show that under natural
   conditions on demand, the second-round tiebreaking lottery can be
   correlated arbitrarily with that of the first round without affecting
   allocative welfare and that reversing the lottery order between rounds
   minimizes reassignment among all PLDA mechanisms. Empirical
   investigations based on data from New York City high school admissions
   support our theoretical findings.

   offer the first evidence that cruise demand becomes more sensitive to
   price during the advance sales period, unlike extant findings in other
   settings. The results also show that demand is greatest late in the
   advance sales period, providing the first finding that a late-season
   high-demand period coincides with a late-season increase in aggregate
   price sensitivity. The high-demand effect more than offsets the
   high-price-responsiveness pattern, leading the firm to increase prices
   throughout the advance sales period. Although the data do not
   disentangle multiple competing explanations for the main findings, they
   are large enough to appear in simple data visualizations and robust

   problems with general structure and integrality constraints are well
   known to be difficult to solve, and we provide new insight into these

   primal-dual analyses and linear programming (LP) rounding. First, we
   relax the one-period ATO problem using a natural newsvendor
   decomposition and use the dual solution for the relaxation to derive a
   lower bound on optimal cost, providing a tight approximation guarantee
   that grows with the maximum product size in the system. Then, we present
   an LP rounding algorithm that achieves both asymptotic optimality as
   demand grows large, and a 1.8 approximation factor for any problem
   instance. In addition to theoretical guarantees, we perform
   comprehensive numerical simulations and find that our rounding algorithm
   outperforms existing techniques and is close to optimal. Finally, we
   demonstrate that our one-period LP rounding results can be used to
   develop an asymptotically optimal integral policy for dynamic ATO

   is increasingly the case that the information used by the firm to gauge

   now also observable to the consumers and may influence their purchase
   decisions. In this paper, we consider a newsvendor model where a product
   of ex ante unknown value is sold in an environment where learning is
   "two-sided" in that both the firm and the consumers learn the product's
   value over time by observing the same information. The analysis
   establishes a consequential insight: When learning is two-sided, the
   value of information is often negative for the firm; as a result, the
   firm' optimal stocking quantity is often lower than that under one-sided
   learning. Moreover, under certain conditions that we identify, we show
   that the optimal stocking quantity can be even lower than the critical
   fractile policy, in stark contrast to the recurring prescription found
   in existing literature of "stocking more" in the presence of learning.
   Additional results and numerical experiments suggest that the loss for
   the firm from failing to account for the two-sidedness of the learning
   process can be significant.

AB We investigate the relation between corporate performance and overall
   economic growth in the United States. In particular, we focus on the
   impact of the U.S. corporate tax regime on this relation. Exploiting
   time-series variation and a tax shock, we document that the relatively
   higher corporate income tax rate and the tax treatment of foreign
   earnings of U.S. corporations have contributed to a disconnect between
   the performance of the corporate sector and the overall economy.
   Specifically, the growth of domestic (national) corporate profits, on
   average, has outpaced the growth of the domestic (national) economy, and
   this disconnect increases as the difference between the U.S. corporate
   income tax rate and the average tax rate of the other Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development countries increases. The
   underlying mechanism is fewer corporate profits being channeled into
   subsequent domestic investments when the U. S. tax rate is relatively
   higher, leading to lower economic growth. Our findings have implications
   for policy setters.

   acquiring information to evaluate a potential project, then reporting
   his or her assessment of the project to the board, and finally
   implementing the project if it is adopted. We demonstrate that the CEO
   receives higher compensation when the board agrees with the CEO on the

   investment decisions and helps motivate the CEO's evaluation effort;
   however, it may induce underreporting and reduce the CEO's incentives to
   properly implement the project. Consequently, if motivating the CEO to
   evaluate projects is the major concern (e.g., innovative industries),
   board expertise exhibits an overall positive effect on firmvalue;

AB Interfirm contracts are plagued by opportunism arising from exchange
   hazards that increase the seller's gains from holdup in fixed price
   contracts. These exchange hazards are higher when the seller can engage
   in unverifiable deliberate obfuscation. Although cost-plus contracts
   reduce holdup losses, they suffer from cost inefficiency. Past research
   has underscored the importance of trust as a control instrument to
   mitigate losses from exchange hazards, especially social relational
   trust that develops from past experiences. However, trust can also be
   calculative when it develops from the expectation of future economic
   gains to the buyer-seller dyad. We identify two dyadic mechanisms that
   generate calculative trust and curtail the likelihood of
   cost-inefficient behavior in cost-plus contracts. These mechanisms
   include future potential and bilateral reputation capital for cost
   containment. Analysis using probit estimations on 149 information
   technology outsourcing contracts for the period 1998 to 2005 suggests
   that calculative trust increases the likelihood of cost-plus contracts.
   Thus, calculative trust can mitigate inefficiencies in interfirm
   contracts.

   experiment on a massive open online course to study the role of forum
   size (number of people in a forum) in the contribution of content per

   The number of questions and other help-seeking threads posted per person
   was unchanged by forum size, but replies and other more conversational
   posts increased sharply. Most of the positive effect of size was in a
   subset of socially responsive subjects. The implication of social
   responsiveness driving our results is that the unequal distribution of
   contribution in online platforms is unlikely to be easily changed: if
   more contributions are elicited from infrequent contributors, the

AB A major result in the study of two-sided platforms is the strategic
   interdependence between the two sides of the same platform, leading to
   the implication that a platform can maximize its total profits by
   subsidizing one of its sides. We show that this result largely depends
   on assuming that at least one side of the market single-homes. As
   technology makes joining multiple platforms easier, we increasingly
   observe that participants on both sides of two-sided platforms
   multihome. The case of multihoming on both sides is mostly ignored in
   the literature on competition between two-sided platforms. We help to
   fill this gap by developing a model for platform competition in a
   differentiated setting (a Hotelling line), which is similar to other
   models in the literature but focuses on the case where at least some
   agents on each side multihome. We show that when both sides in a
   platform market multihome, the strategic interdependence between the two
   sides of the same platform will diminish or even disappear. Our analysis
   suggests that the common strategic advice to subsidize one side in order
   to maximize total profits may be limited or even incorrect when both
   sides multihome, which is an important caveat given the increasing
   prevalence of multihoming in platform markets.

AB Models in which current utility depends solely on current consumption
   (a.k.a. time-separable preferences) are widely acknowledged to be
   unrealistic, especially when attempting to describe preferences over
   consumption rates. Alternatively, one may stipulate that instant utility
   also depends on a state, for example, some stock of past consumption.
   Escaping the gravitational pull of time separability, however, is
   difficult because (1) the behavioral axioms that characterize the state
   and the instant utility are not known, (2) how to elicit the preference
   parameters-most notably the initial level of the state and the decay
   rate-is not known, and (3) managerial applications where state dependent
   preferences produce interesting insights and solutions are scarce. This
   paper makes advances on these three fronts by proposing a novel set of
   axioms that characterize the satiation model, a proof of concept on how
   to elicit all preference parameters using consumption rates, and a
   mixed-integer linear formulation to solve the optimal design of
   experiential services under satiation. Our preferences introduce a
   de-satiation motive, absent in separable preferences, and we explore how
   to optimally manage this motive.

AB We explore marketplace design in the context of a business-to-business
   platform specializing in liquidation auctions. Even when the platform's
   aggregate levels of supply and demand remain fixed, we establish that
   the platform's ability to use its design levers to manage the
   availability of supply over time yields significant value. We study two
   such levers, each using the platform's availability of supply as a means
   to incentivize participation from buyers who decide strategically
   when/how often to participate. First, the platform's listing policy sets
   the ending times of incoming auctions (hence, the frequency of market
   clearing). Exploiting a natural experiment, we illustrate that
   consolidating auctions' ending times to certain weekdays increases the
   platform's revenues by 7.3% mainly by inducing a higher level of bidder
   participation. The second lever is a recommendation system that can be
   used to reveal information about real-time market thickness to potential
   bidders. The optimization of these levers highlights a novel trade-off.
   Namely, when the platform consolidates auctions' ending times, more
   bidders may participate in the marketplace (demand-side competition);
   but ultimately auctions for substitutable goods cannibalize one another
   (supply-side competition). To optimize these design decisions, we
   estimate a structural model that endogenizes bidders' dynamic behavior,
   that is, their decisions on whether/how often to participate in the
   marketplace and how much to bid. We find that appropriately designing a
   recommendation system yields an additional revenue increase (on top of
   the benefits obtained by optimizing the platform's listing policy) by
   reducing supply-side cannibalization and altering the composition of
   participating bidders.

PD DEC 2020
PY 2020
AB Combining forecasts is an established approach for improving forecast
   accuracy. So-called optimal weights (OWs) estimate combination weights
   by minimizing errors on past forecasts. Yet the most successful and
   common approach ignores all training data and assigns equal weights
   (EWs) to forecasts. We analyze this phenomenon by relating forecast
   combination to statistical learning theory, which decomposes forecast
   errors into three components: bias, variance, and irreducible error. In
   this framework, EWs minimize the variance component (errors resulting
   from estimation uncertainty) but ignore the bias component (errors from
   under-sensitivity to training data). OWs, in contrast, minimize the bias
   and ignore the variance component. Reducing one component in general
   increases the other. To address this trade-off between bias and
   variance, we first derive the expected squared error of a combination
   using weights between EWs and OWs (technically, OWs shrunk toward EWs)
   and decompose it into the three error components. We then use the
   components to derive the shrinkage factor between EWs and OWs that
   minimizes the expected error. We evaluate the approach on forecasts from
   the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's Survey of Professional
   Forecasters. For these forecasts, we first show that assumptions
   regarding the error distribution that are commonly used in theoretical
   analyses are likely to be violated in practice. We then demonstrate that
   our approach improves over EWs and OWs if the assumptions are met, for
   instance, as the result of using a standardization procedure for the
   training data.

AB Current regulations on e-cigarettes are minimal compared with cigarette
   regulations, despite their growing popularity globally. Advocates of
   e-cigarettes claim that they aid in ceasing smoking habits. However,
   leaving e-cigarettes unregulated has raised growing health concerns.
   Policymakers in several countries, including the United States and those
   in Europe, are considering and experimenting with policy interventions.
   To evaluate current policies and implement potential regulations on
   e-cigarettes, policy makers must understand the impact of e-cigarettes
   on consumers' smoking behaviors. To address this issue, we construct a
   dynamic structural model that incorporates consumers' purchases and
   consumption behaviors of both cigarettes and e-cigarettes. The results
   from our proposed model indicate that consumption of e-cigarettes
   promotes, rather than counteracts, smoking. This is because the less
   costly e-cigarettes incentivize consumers to build their addiction to
   nicotine, which, in return, increases future consumption of both
   cigarettes and e-cigarettes. This finding calls for regulations on
   e-cigarettes. We then conduct counterfactual analyses to evaluate two
   policy regulations on e-cigarettes: (1) e-cigarette taxes and (2) price
   regulation. Because both of these policies have been discussed
   extensively in both the United States and many countries in the European
   Union, results of our policy simulations address these policy debates.
   We find that both are effective in reducing overall consumption of
   cigarettes and e-cigarettes. We also examine the role of consumers'
   heterogeneity on the simulation results as well as the policy
   implications. We conclude with future research directions, such as
   inclusion of social influence and cross-selling marketing.

   average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them
   holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span
   a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and
   trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we
   find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these
   nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business
   interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to
   investigate the extent to which the executives' trust beliefs toward a
   relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their "network
   trust") impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business
   interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions
   pertaining to the executives' professional experiences that strengthen
   or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives' trust behaviors
   in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse
   professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust
   behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences
   rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that
   improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain
   in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply
   chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can
   better leverage executives' knowledge about how much to rely on network

AB We develop a conceptually grounded approach, based on the International
   Accounting Standards Board's conceptual framework, to the accounting for
   the rights and obligations embodied in a cap-and-trade program. Under
   this approach, firms recognize allowances as intangible assets,
   initially measured at fair value with a credit to cash for purchased
   allowances and to a current period gain for allocated allowances; firms
   recognize current period expense and accrue liabilities, at fair value,
   as they emit; both asset and liability are remeasured at fair value at
   every reporting date. We apply our treatment and three alternative
   treatments, based on current practice and proposals considered by
   standard setters, to transaction-level data from the U.S. sulfur dioxide
   cap-and-trade program to calculate as-if financial statement outcomes
   using actual data. The alternative treatments result in noncomparable
   accounting for otherwise similar arrangements. To provide ex ante
   evidence on the effects of noncomparable accounting, we analyze
   reporting outcomes and show that alternative accounting treatments of
   the same arrangement result in meaningful differences in reported assets
   and liabilities, income volatility, and commonly used performance and
   leverage metrics. Because the financial reporting effects of
   noncomparable accounting are exacerbated by business combinations and
   plant-level purchases of allocated allowances that may have been
   initially recorded at zero, our analysis explicitly accounts for the
   effects of these transactions. Finally, we find that among the four
   accounting treatments we consider, reporting outcomes under our proposed
   approach are most aligned with investor perceptions, as indicated by the
   associations between the market value of equity and assets, liabilities,

AB How does market competition affect pay inequality between and within
   firms? Using division managers as a pool of similar workers and the
   Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, we find that greater competition
   increases overall pay inequality between, but not within, firms. This
   null effect within firms is not driven by a lack of statistical power.
   Instead, we find that it arises primarily within subsamples of firms
   with higher predicted levels of social comparison. Increased competition
   leads to greater pay-performance sensitivity among the higher-paid
   managers within firms, while it leads to greater overpayment among the
   other managers. These patterns are consistent with firm principals
   offering higher-powered incentives to their best managers and overpaying
   the rest. Altogether, this study suggests that, while competition leads
   to greater pay inequality overall, principals aim to maintain equality
   within firms and do so through the differential provision of incentives
   among employees.

   purchasing stocks from momentum oriented hedge and mutual fund managers.
   Superior contrarian hedge fund performance exhibits persistence and
   stems from stock-picking ability rather than liquidity provision.
   Aggregate short sales further support these conclusions about the style
   and skill of various fund manager types.

AB Collusion is widely condemned for its negative effects on consumer
   welfare and market efficiency. In this paper, I show that collusion may
   also in some cases facilitate the creation of unexpected new sources of
   value. I bring this possibility into focus through the lens of a
   historical episode from the 19th century, when colluding railroads in
   the U.S. South converted 13,000 miles of railroad track to standard
   gauge over the course of two days in 1886, integrating the South into
   the national transportation network. Route-level freight traffic data
   reveal that the gauge change caused a large shift in market share from
   steamships to railroads, but did not affect total shipments or prices on
   these routes. Guided by these results, I develop a model of
   compatibility choice in a collusive market and argue that collusion may
   have enabled the gauge change to take place as it did, while also
   tempering the effects on prices and total shipments.

PY 2020
AB Frequently, policy makers seek to roll out an intervention previously
   proven effective in a research study, perhaps subject to resource
   constraints. However, because different subpopulations may respond
   differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that
   the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it
   was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to
   maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust
   optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a
   published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for
   realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough
   to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We
   compare our approach with current practice by proving performance
   guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural
   differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in
   terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic
   distribution between targeted individuals and the study population.
   Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set,
   we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from
   the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using
   real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to
   common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency
   department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management. We
   find that our approach can offer significant benefits over common
   practice, particularly when the heterogeneity in patient response to the
   treatment is large.

PD DEC 2020
PY 2020
AB We study supply chains where multiple suppliers sell to multiple
   retailers through a wholesale market. In practice, we often observe that
   both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market
   price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of
   supply chain competition do not capture retailers' influence on the
   wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price
   and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of
   retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model
   based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is
   determined based on both suppliers' and retailers' decisions. When
   taking into account retailers' buyer power, we obtain the result that is
   consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers
   increases, each retailer's buyer power decreases, and each retailer is
   willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In
   this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or
   suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain
   efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering
   buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply
   chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain
   is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains,
   integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented
   supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

AB This paper provides evidence of ratings shopping in the corporate bond
   market. By estimating systematic differences in agencies' biases about
   any given firm's bonds, I show that new bonds are more likely to be
   rated by agencies that are positively biased toward the firm-a pattern
   that is strongest among bonds that have only one rating. The paper also
   shows that issuers often delay less favorable ratings until after a bond
   is sold. Consistent with theoretical models of ratings shopping, these
   effects are strongest among more complex bonds that are more difficult
   to rate. Bonds with upward-biased ratings are more likely to be
   downgraded and default, but investors account for this bias and demand
   higher yields when buying these bonds.

AB This paper provides evidence on the determinants and economic outcomes
   of updates of accounting systems (AS) over a 24-year timespan in a large
   sample of U.S. hospitals. We provide evidence that hospitals update
   their AS in response to three types of pressures: economic pressures,
   such as increases in the quality of accounting information driven by
   vendor rollouts of improved AS; coercive pressures imposed by regulators
   mandating certain practices, such as internal control practices imposed
   by Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404; and mimetic pressures for hospitals to
   conform their AS to those of their peers, such as local county and
   prominent "celebrity" peers. We find that only economically driven
   updates lead to economic benefits in the form of lower operating
   expenses and higher revenues. In contrast, we find some evidence that AS
   updates prompted by coercive regulatory pressures actually impose
   economic costs in the form of higher operating expenses.

   applications filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office between 2001
   and 2012 and examiner leniency as a source of exogenous variation in
   patent protection, we find that one additional patent granted decreases
   the likelihood of changing employers, on average, by 23%. This decrease
   is stronger when the employee has fewer coinventors, works outside the
   core of the firm, and produces more basic-research innovations. These
   findings are consistent with the idea that patents turn

AB We study the pricing and return policy decisions of an omnichannel
   retailer serving customers who differ in how they realize their
   uncertain valuation for a product-by inspecting in store before purchase
   or by purchasing online and possibly returning misfit products.
   Customers may return misfit products either to stores for a full refund
   or online as per the firm's return policy. We model prices to be
   identical across channels, allow crosschannel returns, and endogenize
   customers' purchase and return decisions, capturing typical features of
   an omnichannel setting. Our analysis helps explain why some omnichannel
   firms choose full refunds, whereas others charge a fee for online
   returns. We find that omnichannel firms with good salvage partners for
   online returns (e.g., Nordstrom) as well as those with more store-based
   customers (e.g., Macy's) should offer full refunds. Similarly, firms are
   incentivized to offer full refunds for products that customers are more
   likely to inspect in store (e.g., Express for footwear). In contrast,
   firms with a significant store network and better in-store salvage
   opportunities (e.g., J.C. Penney) might be better off charging a fee for
   online returns in order to nudge customers to return in store. Finally,
   an omnichannel firm should be cautious both in making the return process
   more convenient and in improving accessibility to its stores, because
   these seemingly beneficial policies, if combined with a partial-refund
   policy, could undermine the firm's overall profit.

AB The decomposition of dynamic risks a company faces into components

   aggregate economic risks, or industry-specific risk drivers, is of
   significant relevance in view of risk management and product design,
   particularly in (life) insurance. Nevertheless, although several
   decomposition approaches have been proposed, no systematic analysis is
   available. This paper closes this gap in literature by introducing
   properties for meaningful risk decompositions and demonstrating that
   proposed approaches violate at least one of these properties. As an
   alternative, we propose a novel martingale representation theorem (MRT)
   decomposition that relies on martingale representation and show that it
   satisfies all of the properties. We discuss its calculation and present
   detailed examples illustrating its applicability.

AB In this article, we examine whether consumers may "accidentally"
   endanger a product they own when a new version of the product is
   introduced. We propose that owners endanger their product when they want
   to upgrade to a new version but have difficulty justifying the upgrade
   and that owners find justification more difficult when a new version
   offers an improved design but does not offer a significant technological
   improvement. Owners endanger their product hoping that it will be
   fortuitously damaged. Product damage provides owners with a good reason
   to upgrade. Focusing on iPhone as a case study, field data and
   experiments provide evidence for product endangering, and they support
   the role of justification in three ways. First, as hypothesized,
   endangering occurs when the new product offers an improved design but
   does not offer a significant technological improvement. Second, owners
   are less likely to endanger a product that is under warranty; therefore,
   damage to it will not enable upgrading. Third, owners are more likely to
   endanger their product when their justification concerns are heightened.

   information externality induces an encouragement effect: a positive
   effect of first player exploration on the optimality of the second
   player exploring as well. When agents have other-regarding preferences
   and imperfectly optimize, the encouragement effect is strongest. The
   explorative nature of the game raises the expected surplus compared with
   a payoff equivalent public goods game. We empirically confirm our main
   theoretical predictions using a novel experimental paradigm. Our
   findings are relevant for motivating and managing groups and teams

AB Using volatile and correlated liquidity shocks to investors as a source

   volatility pressure leads to a 2.6%-4.0% decline in return on assets and
   a $22.6 million loss in cash flow in the subsequent two years. Noise in
   stock prices does not affect product market demand, but it reduces
   firms' total factor productivity, profit margin, and performance in
   research and development and acquisitions. Further evidence suggests
   that noise in stock prices impedes real efficiency through three

AB Extant theories of intertemporal choice entangle two aspects of time
   preference: impatience and time inconsistency. Impatient people focus on
   present consumption without worrying too much about the future; they may
   spend freely and avoid exercise. An outsider might question their
   choices, but impatient people do not experience conflict over those
   choices. By contrast, people who are time-inconsistent intend to save
   and exercise, but they fail to do so when temptation is proximate. Such
   individuals are conflicted; their preferences today differ from their
   preferences tomorrow. I characterize the interaction between impatience
   and time inconsistency in three leading models of temporal discounting
   that go beyond the exponential model, which does not predict time
   inconsistency at any level of impatience. The quasi-hyperbolic model
   predicts that time inconsistency increases with patience, whereas the
   hyperbolic model makes the opposite prediction. The constant-sensitivity
   model predicts that time inconsistency peaks at a moderate level of
   impatience. The results of an experiment using real monetary
   consequences with delays of up to one year align most closely with the
   prediction of the constant-sensitivity model.

PD DEC 2020
PY 2020
AB Consumers are often uncertain about their valuations for product quality
   when choosing among different products and will learn their valuations
   only after buying and using a product. Some consumers may thus
   experience overpurchase or underpurchase regret, depending on whether
   they have purchased a higheror lower-quality level than what they would
   have chosen had they known their true valuations. When consumers
   anticipate their potential postpurchase regret, their purchase decisions
   may be affected. Our analysis shows that overpurchase regret lowers the
   firm's profit, but underpurchase regret can benefit the firm if
   consumers' overpurchase regret is not strong. When the firm optimally
   designs its product line, the quality difference between its offerings
   will be larger (smaller) if consumers' anticipated regret increases
   (reduces) its profit. Surprisingly, although anticipated regret tends to
   reduce consumers' utility, in equilibrium, the presence of anticipated
   regret can increase consumers' expected surplus. We further examine when
   the firm should allow consumers to return their products by paying a
   restocking fee and how the optimal restocking fee will change with
   consumers' propensities for the two types of regret. We also
   experimentally show that consumers' propensities of underpurchase and
   overpurchase regret are different and can be influenced by the firm's
   messages.
