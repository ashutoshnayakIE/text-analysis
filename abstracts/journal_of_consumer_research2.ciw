AB Although technological products are unavoidable in contemporary life,
   studies focusing on them in the consumer behavior field have been few
   and narrow. In this article, we investigate consumers' perspectives,
   meanings, and experiences in relation to a range of technological
   products, emphasizing lengthy and repeated interviews with 29
   households, including a set of first-time owners. We draw on literatures
   spanning from technology, paradox, and postmodernism to clinical and
   social psychology, and combine them with data collection and analysis in
   the spirit of grounded theory. The outcome is a new conceptual framework
   on the paradoxes of technological products and their influences on
   emotional reactions and behavioral coping strategies. We discuss the
   findings in terms of implications for theories of technology, innovation
   diffusion, and human coping, and an expanded role for the paradox
   construct in consumer research.

AB It has been suggested that evaluations may be based on a
   "How-do-I-feel-about-it?" heuristic, which involves holding a
   representation of the target in mind and inspecting feelings that this
   representation may elicit. Previous studies have shown that reliance on
   such feelings depends on whether or not they are believed to be
   representative of the target. This article argues that reliance on
   feelings also depends on whether feelings toward the target are regarded
   as relevant. Consistent with this thesis, findings from three
   experiments indicate that reliance on the "How-do-I-feel-about-it?"
   heuristic is more likely when the decision maker has consummatory as
   opposed to instrumental motives. Results also suggest that subtle
   feelings toward the target are indeed instantiated in the process, and
   that the process may be more likely among individuals with a propensity
   to process information in a visual and sensory manner.

AB Research suggests that individuals mentally track the costs and benefits
   of a consumer transaction for the purpose of reconciling those costs and
   benefits on completion of the transaction (Prelec and Loewenstein 1998;
   Thaler 1980, 1985). In transactions where costs precede benefits, this
   can lead to a systematic and economically irrational attention to sunk
   costs (Arkes and Blumer 1985; Thaler 1880). in this article, we consider
   economic exchanges in which costs significantly precede benefits, as
   with many prepayment types of consumer transactions. We predict a
   consumer will gradually adapt to a historic cost with the passage of
   time, thereby decreasing its sunk-cost impact on the consumption of a
   pending benefit. We label this process of gradual adaptation to costs
   "payment depreciation." In a series of experiments, we find evidence of
   payment depreciation across a range of consumer transactions and offer
   insight into the behavioral implications of temporally separating costs
   from benefits.

AB Consumer decision making has been a focal interest in consumer research,
   and consideration of current marketplace trends (e.g., technological
   change, an information explosion) indicates that this topic will
   continue to be critically important. We argue that consumer choice is
   inherently constructive. Due to limited processing capacity, consumers
   often do not have well-defined existing preferences, but construct them
   using a variety of strategies contingent on task demands. After
   describing constructive choice, consumer decision tasks, and decision
   strategies, we provide an integrative framework for understanding
   constructive choice, review evidence for constructive consumer choice in
   light of that framework, and identify knowledge gaps that suggest
   opportunities for additional research.

   American West. In the process, they become part of a transient

   we develop a historically contextualized understanding of this

   two experiments demonstrate that ego-focused (e.g., pride, happiness)
   Versus other-focused (e.g., empathy, peacefulness) emotional appeals
   lead to more favorable attitudes for members of a collectivist culture,
   while other-focused Versus ego-focused emotional appeals lead to more
   favorable attitudes for members of an individualist culture. Experiment
   2 was conducted to examine the psychological mechanism underlying these
   effects. The results indicated that the generation of and elaboration on
   a relatively novel type of thought (individual thoughts for members of a

   experience increases valuation, and the increase appears to be related
   to the duration of ownership before loss. In addition, the perceived

AB Past research suggests that marketing communications create expectations

   experiences. Since postexperience information can also be important and
   is widespread for established goods and services, it is appropriate to
   ask about the cognitive effects of these efforts. The postexperience
   advertising situation is conceptualized here as an instant
   source-forgetting problem where the language and imagery from the
   recently presented advertising become confused with consumers' own
   experiential memories. It is suggested that, through a reconstructive
   memory process, this advertising information affects how and what
   consumers remember. Consumers may come to believe that their past
   product experience had been as suggested by the advertising. Over time
   this postexperience advertising information can become incorporated into
   the brand schema and influence future product decisions.

AB Preference formation involves comparing brands on specific attributes
   (attribute-based processing) or in terms of overall evaluations
   (attitude-based processing). When consumers engage in an attribute-based
   comparison process, the unique attributes of the focal subject brand are
   weighed heavily, whereas the unique attributes of the less focal
   referent brand are neglected. This is because the attributes of the
   subject are mapped onto the attributes of the referent, rather than vice
   versa. This direction-of-comparison effect is reduced when consumers
   engage in attitude-based processing or when high involvement increases
   motivation to process accessible attributes more thoroughly and
   systematically. The present research investigates a personality
   variable, need for cognition, that increases the likelihood of
   attribute-based (i.e., high need for cognition individuals) versus
   attitude-based processing (i.e., low need for cognition individuals) and
   therefore, also affects the magnitude of the direction-of-comparison
   effect. The direction-of-comparison effect is observed only when
   attribute-based processing is likely (i.e., when need for cognition is
   high) and when thorough and systematic processing is unlikely (i.e.,
   when involvement is low). Mediational analyses involving attribute
   recall and a useful new measure of analytic versus intuitive processing
   support this dual-process model.

AB It is well accepted in the behavioral pricing literature that a
   consumer's perception of the attractiveness of a market price depends on
   a comparison of the market price to an internal reference price. The
   rationale underlying this dynamic has its roots in Adaptation-Level
   Theory. However, consistent with Range Theory, we postulate that a
   consumer's assessment of the attractiveness of a market price may also
   depend on a comparison of the market price to the endpoints of the
   evoked price range. Four experiments provide evidence that variance in
   the width of the evoked price range affects price-attractiveness
   judgments in the absence of any variance in the internal reference
   price. Of theoretical importance, findings from the present article
   suggest that pricing theory is in need of augmentation in order to
   account for this effect. Of managerial relevance, these findings suggest
   that changes in context can bring about changes in the evoked price
   range and perceptions of the attractiveness of a market price.

AB This article investigates the effect of time pressure on choice
   deferral. Recent research suggests that the likelihood of deferral is
   contingent on the ease of making the selection decision (which option to
   choose) as well as the overall attractiveness of the selected
   alternative. We focus on how time pressure systematically impacts choice
   deferral by increasing the use of noncompensatory decision rules in the
   selection decision and by increasing the relative emphasis placed on the
   unique features in the deferral decision (whether to choose). Consistent
   with the hypotheses, we find over a series of five studies that time
   pressure (1) decreases choice deferral when choice involves high
   conflict but not when conflict is low:, (2) reduces the impact of shared
   features on choice deferral, and (3) decreases choice deferral for sets
   with common bad and unique good features (approach-approach conflict)
   but not for sets with common good and unique bad features
   (avoidance-avoidance conflict). We further show that greater attention
   to the unique features is not a general property of decision making
   under time pressure but rather a consequence of the primacy of the
   selection decision over the deferral decision. Consistent with this
   premise, time pressure did not decrease the relative attention paid to
   common features when the task was described as purely a deferral
   decision. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are
   discussed.

AB Four studies were conducted to determine the level of processing that
   occurs during incidental ad exposure and the extent to which effects of
   such processing are driven by unconscious influences. Studies I and 2
   indicate that the addition of semantically related product information
   in an ad facilitates activation of the product concept in memory. As a
   result, the advertised product is more likely to be included in a
   stimulus-based consideration set even when the perceptual features of
   the product under consideration do not match the features of the product
   depiction in the ad. These results are consistent with conceptual
   fluency arising from a semantic analysis that occurs during incidental
   ad exposure. Studies 3 and 4 indicate that when an ad is devoid of other
   product-related information (i.e., when it simply depicts a product by
   itself), processing is limited to a simple feature analysis. The effect
   of this analysis on consideration set judgment is found when the shape
   of the advertised product is unfamiliar, and the perceptual features of
   the product under consideration match those of the product depiction in
   the ad. These results are consistent with the concept of perceptual
   fluency. Further, all four studies provide strong evidence that the
   response bias caused by incidental ad exposure is clue to unconscious
   influences-advertised products were more likely to be included in a
   consideration set even when subjects were explicitly trying to avoid
   choosing products that were depicted in the ads.

   Interviews confirmed that several of the meanings generated by

   diminished or disappeared for the visual tropes (metaphor and pun) in

AB Through three studies we demonstrate that contextually detailed ads are
   facilitative in enhancing brand attitudes and intentions under
   anticipatory self-referencing, whereas ads stripped of contextual detail
   are facilitative in enhancing brand attitudes and intentions under
   retrospective self-referencing. We find that when minimal ad information
   is provided, self-related thoughts about the past contain more
   contextual information than self-related thoughts about the future. In
   study 1, we find that when consumers engage in retrospective
   self-referencing, providing more contextual information in the ad
   increases the incidence of self-related thoughts that are discordant
   with the advertised brand (hereafter, "self-brand discordant thoughts"),
   decreases self-related thoughts that are concordant with the advertised
   brand (hereafter, "self-brand concordant thoughts"), and decreases brand
   attitudes and behavioral intentions. Conversely, when consumers engage
   in anticipatory self-referencing, providing more contextual information
   in the ad increases the incidence of contextually detailed thoughts,
   increases the ability to form consumption visions, increases the
   incidence of self-brand concordant thoughts without affecting self-brand
   discordant thoughts, and increases ad and brand attitudes and behavioral
   intentions. Mediation tests suggest that the effects on brand
   evaluations are mediated both by the extent to which consumers form
   brand-related consumption visions and by the extent to which they can
   link themselves to the advertised brand through concordant thoughts. In
   study 2 we show that the demonstrated differences between retrospection

AB When consumers are presented with negative information about a brand
   that they have evaluated positively earlier, the extent to which they
   change their initial evaluation may depend on the formats in which
   information is presented (noncomparative vs. comparative) at the two
   stages. In four experiments, we manipulate the format in which
   information is presented at an initial and at a challenge stage and
   investigate their effects on the degree of revision in evaluative
   judgments. The results of the four experiments suggest that when
   consumers receive initial information in a noncomparative format, a
   comparative challenge causes a greater degree of revision in the
   evaluative judgments than does a noncomparative challenge. However, when
   the initial information is presented in a comparative format, this
   pattern reverses, and a greater degree of revision occurs under a
   noncomparative challenge than under a comparative challenge. We
   demonstrate that sensitivity to missing information in either of the two
   stages is the process by which these effects obtain. In a fifth
   experiment we examine a boundary condition for these effects.

AB The intensity of price discounting by retailers and manufacturers raises
   important questions about consumer price judgments. In the extreme,
   discounting can take the form of frequent but shallow discounts or deep
   but infrequent discounts. The research reported here explores the
   effects of these strategies on consumer estimation of price levels for
   competing stores and brands. In an initial experiment in which subjects
   made brand choices over time, a depth effect was observed that
   contrasted with the frequency effect found in previous research.
   Subsequent experiments identified the conditions under which depth (vs.
   frequency) characteristics of price data dominate consumers'
   price-estimation judgments. Frequency information is more influential
   when sets of interstore or interbrand comparative prices exhibit complex
   and overlapping distributions (hence creating processing difficulty); in
   contrast, a depth bias occurs when prices have a simpler, dichotomous
   distribution. These results place pragmatically meaningful limitations
   on the influence of frequency information and illustrate the importance
   of context in determining consumer price judgments in a promotional
   environment.

   names in relation to a neutral mood. Respondents' clustering of the

   relational elaboration by prompting the classification of brands on the

   cue for brand name retrieval. Results also suggest that mood can affect
   the rehearsal of the specific brand names. These findings add to the
   growing evidence that mood affects the strategies used to process
   information and demonstrate for the first time that mood affects brand

   regarding the effects that internal reference points for product
   category attractiveness are likely to have on the decision to buy in a
   product category on a store visit. The authors hypothesize that the
   difference between a shopper's reference point for category
   attractiveness and the current level of category attractiveness will
   affect the purchase decision. In particular, the extent of purchase
   postponement caused by a loss (i.e., a negative discrepancy) should

   Reference effects on the category purchase decision are also
   hypothesized to interact with the shopper's familiarity with the store
   visited on a given trip. In particular, the impact of losses is
   predicted to be higher in unfamiliar than in familiar stores. The

AB Cultural commentators addressing the differences between high art and
   mere entertainment have suggested that the standards of popular appeal
   governing the tastes of ordinary consumers differ from the criteria for
   excellence employed by professional critics in rendering expert
   judgments. These concerns appear in discussions of the cultural
   hierarchy (distinguishing among levels of tastes) and in claims that
   commercialism tends to degrade cultural objects (by catering to tastes
   that represent the lowest common denominator). However, such attacks
   make assumptions that are generally left untested and that raise at
   least two key research questions: (RQ1) Do the determinants of popular
   appeal versus expert judgments suggest differing or common standards of
   evaluation for consumers versus critics? (RQ2) Do discrepant (shared)
   tastes produce a negative (positive) correlation between popular appeal
   and expert judgments? The present study addresses these research
   questions for the case of motion pictures. The findings suggest that, at
   least in the case of films, ordinary consumers and professional critics
   do emphasize different criteria in the formation of their tastes but
   that we have reason to question critiques based on the implicit
   assumption of a negative correlation between popular appeal and expert
   judgments.

AB Two studies examining the effects of expectancy, relevancy, and humor on
   attitude formation are presented. Following previous research,
   expectancy refers to the degree to which an item or a piece of
   information falls into some predetermined pattern or structure evoked by
   an ad. Relevancy refers to the degree to which an item or a piece of
   information contributes to the identification of the primary message
   communicated by the ad. Across two studies that examined immediate
   response, we found that information expectancy and relevancy interact to
   produce different levels of attitude favorability, Although ads with
   unexpected-relevant information elicited more favorable attitudes than
   did ads with expected-relevant information, ads with
   unexpected-irrelevant information yielded less favorable attitudes that
   did ads with expected-relevant information. Furthermore, humor and
   relevancy interact where a humorous execution was found to have a
   favorable effect in ads with unexpected-irrelevant information but not
   in ads with unexpected-relevant information. In addition, the second
   study further examined delayed responses in which the findings revealed
   a different pattern. Particularly noteworthy is a sleeper effect for ads
   with unexpected-irrelevant information where attitudes for both the ad
   and the brand improved over time. We conclude with implications and
   suggestions for future research.

AB This article presents a theoretical model that suggests that linguistic
   differences between Chinese and English have a qualitative effect on the
   processing of verbal information. A higher degree of phonological
   processing of English words was hypothesized to result in a superior
   encoding of temporal information. In contrast, a higher degree of
   contextual and visual-semantic processing of Chinese words was
   hypothesized to result in a superior encoding of interitem associative
   information. These effects were hypothesized to be absent for pictorial
   information. Two experiments found support for the hypotheses. In a
   sorting task, native English speakers demonstrated superior temporal
   memory for English words compared with native Chinese speakers for
   Chinese words. In a free recall task, native English speakers
   demonstrated a greater reliance on temporal order in the retrieval of
   English words, whereas native Chinese speakers demonstrated a greater
   reliance on semantic associations in the retrieval of Chinese words. In
   both experiments, cross-cultural differences were absent for
   semantically equivalent pictorial information. The implications of these
   memory findings are discussed with respect to the formation of
   memory-based judgments and the encoding of thematic information in

AB Cosmopolitanism is often heralded as a cultural orientation ideally
   suited to the sociocultural and economic complexities emanating from the
   accelerating pace of globalization. In this study, we analyze the
   consumption stories of expatriate professionals who are trying to enact
   a cosmopolitan identity. For these participants, trying to be
   cosmopolitan precipitates a nexus of salient experiential tensions and
   conflicts that are negotiated through their consumption and leisure
   practices. Although these expatriates identify with dominant
   cosmopolitan ideals of nomadic mobility and cultural adaptability, their
   consumer stories reveal a host of countervailing tensions deriving from
   emotional and Interpersonal ties to home, desires for communal
   affiliations, and enduring preferences for familiar goads and places. We
   trace the history of colonial and patriarchal meanings that form the
   ideological underpinnings to these tensions. We propose that these
   ideological complexities and contradictions foster a paradoxical
   effacement of the conventional boundaries between work and leisure and
   between touristic practices and everyday consumer experiences. We
   discuss the implications of our analysis for theoretical conceptions of
   postmodern consumption and for consumer research on consumption goals.

   directly related to the testing event, as the effects are not replicated

   also show that a false-positive result increases planned compliance if

AB Consumers frequently compare alternatives to make similarity and
   preference judgments. Recent research suggests that the construction of
   both similarity and preference judgments can be captured by a
   feature-matching model that allows for shifts in the relative weights
   assigned to the various features of the alternatives being compared. An
   implication of this model is that engaging in one comparative process
   (e.g., similarity) can influence the relative weight assigned to the
   features that are considered in a second comparative judgment (e.g.,
   preference). Our main proposition that the type and direction of the
   initial comparison process has a systematic effect on subsequent
   preference judgments and choice was tested in a series of studies. One
   study, which focused on alternatives about which consumers have
   information in memory. shows that the direction of an initial comparison
   task that elicits differences between two options systematically alters
   their relative attractiveness in a subsequent preference task. In two
   subsequent studies, the effect of engaging in an initial comparison task
   on subsequent preference judgments was tested for stimulus-based choice
   sets. The results on choice deferral and choice satisfaction were
   consistent with the notion that engaging in similarity/dissimilarity
   comparisons altered the relative weight assigned to common and unique
   features for the two alternatives. Mouselab was used to support the
   decision mechanisms underlying the effect of the initial
   similarity/dissimilarity judgments. An additional study examined how the
   effect of adding common features on subsequent preference was also
   contingent on the initial comparison task. We conclude with a study
   involving real consequences and a discussion of the theoretical and
   practical goals of our findings.

   associations embedded in persuasion appeals better account for the
   attitudinal differences found in the culture and persuasion literature.
   Experiment 1 replicates basic findings showing that high
   culture-distinct associations lead to more favorable attitudes for
   individuals in the target culture relative to a nontarget culture, while
   low culture-distinct associations lead to more attitudinal similarities
   across cultural boundaries. Experiments 2 and 3 explore two potential
   explanations for these effects. Convergent evidence, provided through
   within-culture and across-culture mediation analysis, is more supportive
   of the differential accessibility explanation. That is, high
   culture-distinct associations may be valued in the nontarget culture but
   are relatively inaccessible in memory at an individual level. The
   results of these experiments help to reconcile conflicting findings in
   the consumer psychology literature, shed insight on why cultural
   differences might occur, and add to the growing body of research that
   identifies conditions under which cultural similarities in persuasion

AB Consumers sometimes treat trivial attributes as though they were
   critically important in the sense that they have a significant impact on
   choice. We propose a reasons-based account to explain the valuation of
   trivial attributes and in particular why valuation is in some cases
   positive and in others negative. We suggest that consumers treat trivial
   attributes as though they had value when such valuation is instrumental,
   that is, helps accomplish a task goal. The valence of the effect can
   depend on whether a positive or negative reason provides a clearer
   justification for preferring a single brand over its competitors. Thus
   the same trivial attribute can generate a positive or negative valuation
   depending on the choice setting. Such valuation is not always driven by
   inferences about the attribute itself but can reflect transitory
   reasoning about the brand as a whole, based on the way it is
   differentiated from its competitors. Results from two experiments
   support the reasons-based model and help resolve some apparently
   conflicting effects previously reported for trivial attributes.

AB The current research examines how positive mood influences consumer
   evaluations of brand extensions. As a means of addressing this issue, we
   integrate findings from prior research on brand extensions with those
   concerning the effect of mood on similarity and evaluative judgments.
   Our results indicate that positive mood primarily enhances evaluations
   of extensions viewed as moderately similar (as opposed to very similar
   or dissimilar) to a favorably evaluated core brand. This pattern of
   effects prevailed in separate studies using two different types of mood
   manipulations. The evidence supports a mood process in which the
   influence of positive mood on extension evaluations is mediated by its
   effects on perceptions of the similarity between the core brand and the
   extension as well as the perceived competency of the marketer in
   producing the extension. Implications of these findings for marketing
   managers are presented along with suggestions for further research.

AB The article develops a model of regret and tests it via four studies.
   Study 1 develops a multi-item measure of regret and distinguishes it
   from satisfaction. It also shows that, while satisfaction directly
   influences both repurchase and complaint intentions, regret directly
   influences only repurchase intentions, and its effect on complaint
   intentions is fully mediated via satisfaction. Study 2 examines the
   antecedents and moderators of regret. It shows that regret is
   experienced even in the absence of information on a better-forgone
   outcome. Furthermore, the moderating effect of three situation-specific
   characteristics (outcome valence, status quo preservation, and
   reversibility of the outcome) is examined. Studies 3 and 4 examine the
   cognitive process underlying the experiencing of regret in the absence
   of information on a better-forgone outcome. Generation of
   counterfactuals is identified as the cognitive mechanism that engenders
   regret. Results show that counterfactuals are most likely to be
   generated when the chosen outcome is negative and not the status quo.

AB Vigorous consumption is the sign of a prosperous and confident society.
   Some critics, however, find a high level of consumption morally
   objectionable. To see what is valid in these objections, one needs to
   understand the connection between consumption and the characteristic
   pattern of technology that is highlighted by the device paradigm and
   gives rise to paradigmatic consumption. Such consumption induces
   disengagement from reality and a decline of excellence. The response to
   these debilities is to accept paradigmatic consumption in some areas of
   life and to make room for focal things and practices in others. Research
   is needed to determine the social reality, and to probe the common
   awareness, of paradigmatic consumption and focal practices.

   support the proposition that these possessions establish a semiotic
   linkage, which enables consumers to verify self-selected moments from

AB This research investigates the interaction between a very common task,
   explaining decisions, and an individual difference, need for uniqueness
   (NFU), on buyer decision making. We propose that explaining (or
   providing reasons for) decisions shifts the focus from the choice of
   options to the choice of reasons. Furthermore, buyers who explain their
   decisions and have high NFU tend to select unconventional reasons and
   are, consequently, more likely to make unconventional choices. These
   predictions were supported in a series of studies involving choices
   between conventional and less-conventional options, such as whether to
   switch to a brand on sale, whether to select a compromise option, and
   whether to accept a gamble with a possible loss. The findings also
   indicate that the effects of providing reasons are not due to attempts
   to act rationally or to concerns about being evaluated. Three boundary
   conditions on the generalization that high NFU consumers who provide
   reasons tend to make unconventional choices were examined, all involving
   forces that promote conformity over uniqueness. They include evaluation
   by others, explicit information about the preferences of others, and
   negative feedback on previous decision performance. We discuss the
   implications of this research with respect to the roles of explanations,
   NFU, and accountability in buyer decision making.

AB This article examines conditions that influence consumers' use of
   persuasion knowledge in evaluating an influence agent, such as a
   salesperson. We propose that persuasion knowledge is used when consumers
   draw an inference that a persuasion motive may underlie a salesperson's
   behavior. These motive inferences then affect perceptions of the
   salesperson. We propose that two factors, the accessibility of
   persuasion motives and the cognitive capacity of the consumer, affect
   whether consumers use persuasion knowledge. When an ulterior persuasion
   motive is highly accessible, both cognitively busy targets and unbusy
   observers use persuasion knowledge to evaluate the salesperson. When an
   ulterior motive is less accessible, cognitively busy targets are less
   likely to use persuasion knowledge, evaluating the salesperson as more
   sincere than are cognitively unbusy observers. Several experiments find
   support for the predictions.

   gift-giving such a torturous endeavor for so many people? What
   conditions coincide with the anxious moments that givers often
   experience? What factors drive this anxiety? These questions are
   explored in this article, which develops a model based on a
   self-presentational theory and two sets of qualitative data. The results
   show that givers become anxious when they are highly motivated to elicit
   desired reactions from their recipients but are pessimistic about their
   prospects of success. This article identifies characteristics of
   recipients, givers, and gift situations that appear to precipitate these

AB Two experiments examined the factors that influence and the

   Subjects received attribute information that was either condensed in a
   single product or dispersed across several products manufactured in a
   country with relatively unfavorable associations. When consumers use
   country of origin as a basis for judgment under low motivation, or when
   the processing goal is to evaluate the country of origin, they focus on
   the country-of-origin information. Under such conditions, relevant
   evidence about the country of origin provided by dispersed information
   is likely to affect country-of-origin evaluations. In contrast, if
   consumers do not focus on the country of origin, such as under high
   motivation, or if their processing goal directs their attention away
   from country-of-origin information, any evidence about the country of
   origin is less likely to be utilized in their judgments. Findings from
   two experiments are consistent with this theorizing and highlight the
   central role of motivational intensity and direction in moderating the
   effect of information type on country-of-origin evaluations.

AB Ours is an age of consumerism, and the study of persuasion is a central
   topic of consumer research. Over time our knowledge of most persuasive
   topics has grown, but on a few topics knowledge has been lost. One lost
   topic is the persuasion effect of using figurative language (tropes,
   rhetorical figures) in communications, which had been a popular issue in
   earlier ages of persuasion but in our own era has been largely ignored.
   This neglect can be corrected by our "standing on the shoulders of
   ancients" and exploiting the progress made during earlier rhetorical
   ages in identifying and classifying tropes and hypothesizing how
   inclusion of such rhetorical figures affects perceptions and impacts of
   communications. A program of research on the effects of figurative
   language is described as an example of how giving greater consideration
   to ancient wisdom can enhance our understanding of persuasive
   communication and consumer behavior, especially in the creative

AB We argue that a way culture influences decisions is through the reasons
   that individuals recruit when required to explain their choices.
   Specifically, we propose that cultures endow individuals with different
   rules or principles that provide guidance for making decisions, and a
   need to provide reasons activates such cultural knowledge. This
   proposition, representing a dynamic rather than dispositional view of
   cultural influence, is investigated in studies of consumer decisions
   that involve a trade-off between diverging attributes, such as low price
   and high quality. Principles enjoining compromise are more salient in
   East Asian cultures than in North American culture, and accordingly, we
   predict that cultural differences in the tendency to choose compromise
   options will be greater when the decision task requires that
   participants provide reasons. In study 1, a difference between Hong Kong
   Chinese and North American participants in the tendency to select
   compromise products emerged only when they were asked to explain their
   decisions, with Hong Kong decision makers more likely and Americans less
   likely to compromise. Content analysis of participants' reasons
   confirmed that cultural differences in the frequency of generating
   particular types of reasons mediated the difference in choices. Studies
   2 and 3 replicate the interactive effect of culture and the need to
   provide reasons in a comparison of North American versus Japanese
   participants and in a comparison of European-American and Asian-American
   participants, respectively. Studies 4 and 5 found that Hong Kong Chinese
   participants, compared with Americans, evaluate proverbs and the reasons
   of others more positively when these favor compromise. We discuss the
   value of conceptualizing cultural influences in terms of dynamic
   strategies rather than as dispositional tendencies.

AB This article explores precipitating events, emotions, and decisions
   associated with older consumers' disposition of special possessions.
   Findings are based on analyses of semistructured interviews with 80
   older consumers, complemented by depth interviews with seven informants.
   Cherished possessions and their disposition play a significant role in
   older consumers' reminiscence and life review. Concerns about
   disposition of special possessions involve strong and ambivalent
   emotions. Older consumers voice concern over avoiding intrafamilial
   conflict, reducing uncertainty, and exercising control over the future
   life of special possessions. We emphasize the storied nature of the
   meanings consumers attach to their cherished possessions and the way in
   which these storied meanings are bundled with life review and
   disposition concerns. Many older consumers attempt to control meanings
   transferred with cherished possessions. They seek to pass on personal
   and familial legacies, achieve symbolic immortality, insure a good home
   for special objects, and/or influence the future lives of others. We
   show that there is a porous boundary between ownership and disposition
   of cherished possessions. And to our knowledge this is the first
   research to identify tactics and heuristics employed to select
   recipients for special possessions, time transfers, and effect these
   transfers. We suggest that future research could explore individual
   differences in disposition behaviors, the use of possessions by older
   consumers as external mnemonic props, disposition decision theory,
   cultural differences in disposition behaviors, or the role of special
   possessions in the creation of familial legacies.

AB How do preferences change when consumers focus on the anticipated
   satisfaction with a purchase rather than choice? In a series of three
   studies, we show that preferences, both expressed and revealed. change
   depending on the degree to which anticipated satisfaction is evoked.
   These shifts in preferences arise because, compared to choice,
   anticipated satisfaction elicits a mental-imaging processing strategy
   that is both more effort intensive and qualitatively different. By
   providing direct evidence from thought protocols and by presenting
   evidence suggesting that these shifts in preferences vanish when mental
   imagery is discouraged or made more difficult, we show that the effect
   arises out of a processing strategy that requires effortful mental
   imagery of one or more of the options in the decisionmaking task.
   Finally, we demonstrate the uniqueness of the effect by showing that it
   cannot be generated with heightened processing or by an orientation that
   is directed toward the extent to which the options are liked.

AB One of the main objectives facing marketers is to present consumers with
   information on which to base their decisions. In doing so, marketers
   have to select the type of information system they want to utilize in
   order to deliver the most appropriate information to their consumers.
   One of the most interesting and distinguishing dimensions of such
   information systems is the level of control the consumer has over the
   information system. The current work presents and tests a general model
   for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of information
   control on consumers' decision quality, memory, knowledge, and
   confidence. The results show that controlling the information flow can
   help consumers better match their preferences, have better memory and
   knowledge about the domain they are examining, and be more confident in
   their judgments. However, it is also shown that controlling the
   information flow creates demands on processing resources and therefore
   under some circumstances can have detrimental effects on consumers'
   ability to utilize information. The article concludes with a summary of
   the findings, discussion of their application for electronic commerce,
   and suggestions for future research avenues.

AB Consumer responses to stockouts, both in terms of consumer satisfaction
   with the decision process and in terms of subsequent store choice
   behavior, are explored. Four laboratory experiments involving stockouts
   in a consumer choice context are run. The results suggest that consumer
   response to stockouts is driven in large part by two factors: the effect
   of a stockout on the difficulty of making a choice from the set and the
   degree of personal commitment to the out-of-stock alternative. The
   results show that personal commitment to an out-of-stock choice option
   is a function of preference for the option, whether the option is
   included in the consumer's consideration set, and the degree to which
   the stockout announcement is personally directed. As personal commitment
   to the out-of-stock option increases, consumers react substantially and
   negatively to the stockout-they report lower satisfaction with the
   decision process and show a higher likelihood of switching stores on
   subsequent shopping trips. However, under conditions in which personal
   commitment to the out-of-stock option is low and the stockout leads to a
   decrease in the difficulty of making a product selection, consumer
   response to the stockout can actually be positive.

AB Consuming is defined as behavior whereby entropy is increased in
   exchange for existential or experiential rewards. Existential rewards
   are well known-for example, the satisfaction of Maslowian needs. But
   experiential rewards are perhaps just as important: these refer to the
   temporary improvement in positive mood people experience when they are
   acting in goal-directed, purposeful ways. Consuming is one way for
   obtaining such experiences, it is suggested that in order to evaluate
   the impact of consuming it is necessary to measure the entropy costs of
   the behavior balanced against the psychic benefits it provides.

AB Three modes of resistance to persuasion (biased assimilation, relative
   weighting of attributes, and minimization of impact) were examined in
   the context of a longitudinal field study of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair
   and a lab experiment in the consumer setting. Only two of these modes
   (biased assimilation and relative weighting) were found to be sensitive
   to the refutability of the persuasive communication; the effectiveness
   of the remaining one (minimization of impact) was not influenced by this
   factor. Specifically, committed individuals demonstrated biased
   assimilation in the face of easy to refute negative information, but
   this mode of resistance decreased in its effectiveness when the
   information became difficult to refute. The relative-weighting mode of
   resistance (decreasing the weight given to attributes influenced by the
   negative information and increasing the weight given to favorably
   evaluated attributes), in contrast, emerged only in the face of
   difficult to refute information, apparently when biased assimilation
   decreased in its effectiveness. TI-le impact mode of resistance was
   fairly effective in the face of both easy and difficult to refute
   information. That is, committed respondents attempted to isolate the
   impact of the negative information to the target attribute, minimizing
   its spillover to the other attributes in the attitudinal representation
   in response to both easy and difficult to refute messages.

AB Many individual decisions take place in a group context wherein group
   members voice their choices sequentially. In this article we examine the
   impact of this dynamic decision process on individuals' choices and
   satisfaction with their outcomes. We propose that choices reflect a
   balancing of two classes of goals: goals that are strictly individual
   and goals that are triggered by the existence of the group. The tatter
   sometimes results in choices that undermine personal satisfaction and
   increase regret. We find support for goal balancing in three studies in
   which we tracked consumers' orders of dishes and drinks. In the Lunch
   study we found that real groups (tables) choose more Varied dishes than
   would be expected by random sampling of the population of all individual
   choices across all tables. The Beer study demonstrates that this
   group-level variety seeking is attributable to the interaction-implicit
   or explicit-among group members, and can be dissipated when the group is
   forced to "disband" and its members make strictly individual choices.
   Finally, the Wine study demonstrated that individual choices in a group
   context are also aimed at satisfying goals of information gathering and
   self-presentation in the form of uniqueness.

AB Studies of grocery sales show that consumers of store brands switch to
   (price) discounted national brands more than consumers of national
   brands switch to discounted store brands. Such asymmetric price
   competition can be explained with numerous mechanisms proposed here and
   elsewhere. We report a choice experiment that replicates asymmetric
   price competition favoring higher-quality competitors and demonstrates
   asymmetric quality competition favoring lower-quality competitors. Also
   demonstrated are multiple mechanisms contributing to competitive
   asymmetries, where dominance involving the otherwise preferred brand is
   particularly potent (e.g., when a higher-quality, competitor matches the
   price of an otherwise preferred lower-quality brand). The findings
   implicate modifications to (1) theories of decision making when extended
   to repeat choice, (2) empirical models of secondary purchase data, and
   (3) strategies for positioning and attacking brands. Whereas improving
   competitive disadvantages often attracts consumers from competitors more
   than does improving competitive advantages. this benefit must be weighed
   against the differentiation sacrificed by improving competitive
   disadvantages (improving competitive advantages,,in contrast, increases
   differentiation).

AB Prior research has examined the composition of memory-based
   consideration sets in usage situations in terms of the specific products
   included in them. To shed more light on how much effort it would take
   consumers to choose from a memory-set and how difficult it would be for
   a product to enter or remain in that set, this research examines the
   composition of memory-sets in terms of their descriptive
   characteristics: stability, or how consistent the set is across similar
   situations; size, or how large the set is; variety, or how distinct the
   products within the set are; and preference dispersion, or how equal the
   preferences are toward the set products. To pinpoint the specific
   elements of usage situations that influence these properties and to
   address the limitation of inconsistent operationalizations of usage
   situations both within and across prior studies, this research
   operationalized usage situations in terms of two key elements: usage
   occasion and usage location. Results of two studies using 32 situations
   that varied on occasion and location familiarities in two replicate
   product classes revealed that memory-sets of more familiar occasions had
   lower stability, larger size, and marginally greater variety. Similarly,
   sets of more familiar locations portrayed lower stability than those of
   less familiar locations, as well as set variety equal to those of less
   familiar locations. Finally, the underlying explanation of tie above
   results, the process of forming memory-sets-direct retrieval of items
   from memory in more familiar situations and use of situation goals in
   less familiar situations - was also confirmed.

AB Behavioral researchers use analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of
   differences between treatment means or chi-square tests of differences
   between proportions to provide support for empirical hypotheses about
   consumer behavior. These tests are typically conducted on data from
   "between-subjects" experiments in which participants were randomly
   assigned to conditions. We show that, despite using internally valid
   experimental designs such as this, aggregation biases can arise in which
   the theoretically critical pattern holds in the aggregate even though it
   holds for no (or few) individuals. First, we show that crossover
   interactions-often taken as strong evidence of moderating variables-can
   arise from the aggregation of two or more segments that do not exhibit
   such interactions when considered separately. Second, we show that
   certain context effects that have been reported for choice problems can
   result from the aggregation of two (or more) segments that do not
   exhibit these effects when considered separately. Given these threats to
   the conclusions drawn from experimental results, we describe the
   conditions under which unobserved heterogeneity can be ruled out as an
   alternative explanation based an one or more of the following: a priori
   considerations, derived properties, diagnostic statistics, and the
   results of latent class modeling. When these tests cannot rule out
   explanations based on unobserved heterogeneity, this is a serious
   problem for theorists who assume implicitly that the same theoretical
   principle works equally for everyone, but for random error. The
   empirical data patterns revealed by our diagnostics can expose the
   weakness in the theory but not fix it. It remains for the researcher to
   do further work to understand the underlying constructs that drive
   heterogeneity effects and to revise theory accordingly.

   Furthermore, information that seemed to preserve the good mood but

AB We propose that buying- and selling-price estimates reflect a focus on
   what the consumer forgoes in the potential exchange and that this nation
   offers insight into the well-known difference between those two types of
   value assessment. Buyers and sellers differ not simply in their
   valuation of the same item but also in how they assess the value. Buyers
   tend to focus on their sentiment toward what they forgo (typically, the
   expenditure), and buying prices are thus heavily influenced by Variables
   such as salient reference prices. By the same token, sellers tend to
   focus on their sentiment toward surrendering the item. and selling
   prices are hence more heavily influenced by variables such as benefits
   of possessing the item. Four studies examining buying- and selling-price
   estimates of tickets for National Collegiate Athletic Association
   basketball games offer consistent support for these ideas. The studies
   show that naturally occurring differences among respondents in attitudes
   relating to the tickets that sellers forgo (e.g., significance of the
   game) corresponded more closely to Variation in selling prices than in
   buying prices. conversely, measures relating to the expenditure (e.g.,
   respondents' concern with money) corresponded more closely to buying
   prices than to selling prices. Using controlled manipulations we then
   showed that changes in aspects relating to the game (e.g., expected
   climate in the stadium) affected selling prices more than buying prices,
   but changes relating to the expenditure (e.g., list price of the ticket)
   influenced buying prices more than selling prices. We also showed that
   drawing attention to the benefits of possessing a ticket before asking
   for the price estimates influenced buying prices more than selling
   prices, supporting our claim that otherwise these benefits are naturally
   more salient to sellers than buyers. Similarly, drawing attention to
   alternative uses of money before asking for price estimates influenced
   selling prices more than buying prices.

AB When a consumer who already owns a durable-type product in a category
   faces the opportunity to upgrade to a new, higher-quality product, the
   replacement purchase decision is driven by both normative economic
   factors and psychological factors. As a normative decision maker, s/he
   considers the purchase price of the new alternative, but s/he
   additionally considers the mental cost of retiring the old product
   before s/he has gotten his/her money's worth out of it. During ownership
   of a product, a consumer mentally depreciates the initial purchase
   price, thus creating a "mental book value" for the product. The
   write-off of this mental book value is felt as the mental cost of a
   replacement purchase. Based on the principles of mental accounting and
   mental depreciation, I provide a theoretical explanation for this mental
   cost and why an individual's replacement purchase decision may be more
   sensitive to the mental cost than the marginal cost. When applied
   appropriately, mental accounting can serve a useful purpose to the
   utility-maximizing consumer in the long run, but when misapplied, it
   results in a misallocation of resources that does not add any value from
   the perspective of utility maximization. Through three experiments, I
   measure the negative effect of the write-off on a replacement purchase
   decision and demonstrate ways in which it can be mitigated. Trade-ins
   are examined as one way in which a consumer can be guided to make
   replacement purchase decisions that are more aligned with normative
   choice.

AB When deciding when to make a purchase, people often compare their
   outcomes to those that would have occurred had they purchased earlier or
   later. In this article, we examine how pre- and postpurchase comparisons
   affect regret and satisfaction, and whether consumers learn to avoid
   decisions that result in regret. In the first two experiments, we show
   that information learned after the purchase has a greater impact on
   satisfaction than information learned before the purchase. In addition,
   negative price comparisons have a greater impact on satisfaction than
   positive comparisons. These results imply that if consumers who receive
   postpurchase information wish to avoid future feelings of regret, they
   should defer their purchases longer. Our second two experiments
   demonstrate this phenomenon: Subjects who were exposed to postchoice
   information set higher decision thresholds, consistent with the
   minimization of future regret. Paradoxically, providing subjects with
   additional postchoice information resulted in decreased average
   earnings, suggesting that consumers may try to avoid future regret even
   when doing so conflicts with expected value maximization.

   article shows that the use of different payment mechanisms influences
   both these factors and hence moderates the effects of past payments on
   future spending. Specifically, past payments strongly reduce purchase
   intention when the payment mechanism requires the consumer to write down
   the amount paid (rehearsal) and when the consumer's wealth is depleted

   attractive and unattractive common features on consumer preferences.
   Building on the existing research on confirmatory information processing
   and the motivated reasoning framework, I propose that consumers evaluate
   common features in a way that supports their already established
   preferences. In a series of three studies, I show that the impact of
   common features is moderated by their attractiveness and the strength of
   individuals' already established preferences. In the context of a choice
   task, only attractive features were found to enhance individuals'
   already established preferences, and this effect was more pronounced for
   consumers with already established brand preferences compared to
   consumers who were indifferent to the options. The effect of attractive
   and unattractive features was reversed in the context of a rejection
   rather than a selection task. These findings are interpreted in the
   context of consumers confirmatory reasoning aimed at reaching a
   consistent and readily justifiable decision.

AB To understand really new products, consumers face the challenge of
   constructing new knowledge structures rather simply changing existing
   ones. Recent research in categorization suggests that one strategy for
   creating representations for these new products is to use information
   already contained in familiar product categories. While knowledge from
   multiple existing categories may be relevant, little research has
   examined how (and if) consumers process information drawn from more than
   one domain. We use two experiments to demonstrate how consumers use cues
   from multiple categories to develop expectations about and preferences
   for new products. Our findings suggest that the first plausible category
   label provided to the consumer significantly influences their
   categorizations, expectations, and preferences. Only when advertisers
   place limits on the type of information to transfer from each existing
   category can consumers use information from multiple categories
   effectively.

AB This article outlines a consumer-focused approach for the study of
   consumer behavior. I argue that much of the existing literature, by
   developing knowledge that focuses on the determinants of consumer
   purchasing, is implicitly biased toward a marketing perspective of
   consumer behavior. In contrast, I propose the need for a
   consumer-focused approach that would advance knowledge aimed at helping
   consumers make wiser purchases. This approach should address the most
   important and challenging consumer decisions, describe consumer behavior
   in a manner that leads to prescriptions, consider the actions of other
   parties in the marketplace, and identify biases unique to or exacerbated
   by the consumer context. This article then illustrates what such a
   consumer-focused approach would imply for consumer research in three
   areas: negotiations, financial services, and auctions.

   which information that is similar in valence (i.e., evaluatively
   consistent) with a person's mood is weighted more heavily in product
   judgments. Specifically, the affect that participants experience as a
   result of a transitory mood state may appear to either confirm or
   disconfirm their reactions to product information, leading them to give
   this information more or less weight when evaluating the product as a
   whole. This affective confirmation typically occurs when hedonic
   criteria are considered more important in evaluation than utilitarian
   criteria. Four experiments confirmed implications of this
   conceptualization.

AB It is generally accepted that repeated exposure to an advertisement can
   influence liking for an advertisement and for the brand names and
   product packages included in the advertisement. Although it has often
   been assumed that repeated exposure leads to a direct affective
   response, more recent evidence suggests that prior exposure leads to
   processing fluency at the time of judgment. It is a misattribution about
   the source of this processing fluency that results in preference for the
   stimulus. To date, the majority of research on the processing
   fluency/attribution hypothesis has focused on when people will make
   fluency-based attributions, while assuming the amount of the processing
   fluency is a direct function of exposure. In this article, we propose
   that stimulus characteristics and presentation factors will interact
   with repetition to determine the amount of processing fluency associated
   with a stimulus at various levels of exposure. Four studies are used to
   test whether two-factor theory or dual-process theory provides a better
   account of the source of the processing fluency. Implications for logo
   design are discussed.

AB In four experiments, we show that goals associated with approach and
   avoidance needs influence persuasion and that the accessibility of
   distinct self-views moderates these effects. Specifically, individuals
   with an accessible independent self-view are more persuaded by
   promotion-focused information that is consistent with an approach goal.
   In contrast, individuals whose interdependent self-view is more
   accessible are more persuaded by prevention focused information that is
   consistent with an avoidance goal. When the persuasive appeal is
   compatible with self-regulatory focus, individuals demonstrate greater
   recall of the message content and are more discerning regarding argument
   strength. These findings provide convergent evidence that central
   processing under goal compatible conditions underlies the persuasion
   effects.

AB Consumers acquire and display material possessions for the purpose of
   feeling differentiated from other people and, thus, are targeted with a
   variety of marketing stimuli that attempt to enhance self-perceptions of
   uniqueness. Because the pursuit of differentness (or counterconformity
   motivation) varies across individuals to influence consumer responses,
   we develop and validate a trait measure of consumers' need for
   uniqueness. Consumers' need for uniqueness is defined as an individual's
   pursuit of differentness relative to others that is achieved through the
   acquisition, utilization, and disposition of consumer goods for the
   purpose of developing and enhancing one's personal and social identity.
   Following assessments of the scale's latent structure, a series of
   validation studies examines the scale's validity. The presentation of
   empirical work is followed by a discussion of how consumers' need for
   uniqueness could be used in better understanding consumer behavior and

   media images and objects. Field notes and artifacts from 20 months of
   fieldwork at Star Trek fan clubs, at conventions, and in Internet

   Treks subculture of consumption is found to be constructed as a powerful

   shape the diverse subcultures' consumption meanings and practices.
   Legitimizing articulations of Star Trek as a religion or myth underscore
   fans' heavy investment of self in the text. These sacralizing
   articulations are used to distance the text from its superficial status
   as a commercial product. The findings emphasize and describe how
   consumption often fulfills the contemporary hunger for a conceptual
   space in which to construct a sense of self and what matters in life.
   They also reveal broader cultural tensions between the affective
   investments people make in consumption objects and the encroachment of

AB This research investigates the conditions under which persistent
   preferences for product attributes occur and the processes that lead to
   these effects. Our theoretical framework suggests that ambiguity in the
   context in which the initial choices are made determines the level of
   certainty in the initial preference. Certainty in the initial preference
   combines with uninformative additional experience to create a shift in
   the relevance of the attributes and biased information gathering in
   subsequent choices. These tendencies in turn lead to persistent
   preferences for the attributes of a previously chosen brand. In
   experiments 1A, 1B, and 1C, we varied the levels of ambiguity in the
   initial choice context and additional experience with a chosen brand and
   studied their effect on preference persistence. The findings offer
   support to the processes we propose. In experiment 2, we found that
   additional experience caused persistent preferences even for an
   irrelevant attribute as long as it was a differentiating attribute in
   the initial choice. Experiments 3 and 4 found that (a) the relative
   attractiveness of the chosen brand in the initial choice context and (b)
   a deliberation that compared the competing attributes in terms of their
   ability to render certain benefits attenuated the effects found in
   experiments 1A and 1B.

AB The variety seeking theoretical paradigm offers little guidance
   regarding the attributes of a stimulus that are most likely to drive the
   desire to switch. We review 25 years of research in physiobehavior,
   arguing that it can be extended in a natural way to predict that
   consumers are more likely to switch between sensory attributes (e.g.,
   flavor) than nonsensory attributes (e.g., brand). Specifically, we
   examine the work on sensory-specific satiety, a term used to describe
   the phenomenon whereby the pleasantness of a food just eaten drops
   significantly while the pleasantness of uneaten foods remains unchanged.
   These findings lead to the thesis explored in this research that
   consumers are more likely to seek variety on sensory attributes, which
   is then tested across three studies comparing flavor switching to brand
   switching. Study 1 uses ACNielsen wand panel data for purchases of
   tortilla chips and cake mixes from almost 2,000 consumers over a
   three-year period. Study 2 examines actual consumption behavior using a
   six-week consumption diary panel from over 850 consumers in two cities.
   Heterogeneity across the samples in terms of the observed effects is
   examined in both studies. Study 3 employs a survey methodology to
   ascertain whether the differential role of flavor-based versus
   brand-based variety seeking is mediated by factors other than
   sensory-specific satiety. The findings strongly support the relevance of
   sensory-specific satiety to attribute-level variety seeking. Across the
   three studies, consumers switched more intensively on flavor than brand
   in 14 of the 15 categories examined and other factors such as preference
   heterogeneity and perceived risk fail to explain this difference.

   emotional contagion occurred among "receivers" who "caught" a happy

   between the emotion experienced by senders and receivers was found to be
   mediated by receivers mimicking smiling on the part of senders. Exposing
   receivers to happy senders they liked also resulted in receivers having
   a positive attitudinal bias toward a product. The happiness experienced
   by receivers via contagion was found to mediate the effects of sender
   emotion and receiver liking of the sender on receiver product attitudes.
   The second experiment replicated the first while demonstrating that
   observation of the facial expressions of senders by receivers, thus
   allowing mimicking of smiling, was a necessary condition for emotional
   contagion to occur. The relevance of emotional contagion for

AB Four studies show that consumers have not one but two distinct learning
   processes that allow them to use brand names and other product features
   to predict consumption benefits. The first learning process is a
   relatively unfocused process in which all stimulus elements get
   cross-referenced for later retrieval. This process is backward looking
   and consistent with human associative memory (HAM) models. The second
   learning process requires that a benefit be the focus of prediction
   during learning. It assumes feature-benefit associations change only to
   the extent that the expected performance of the product does not match
   the experienced performance of the product. This process is forward
   looking and consistent with adaptive network models. The importance of
   this two-process theory is most apparent when a product has multiple
   features. During HAM learning, each feature-benefit association will
   develop independently. During adaptive learning, features will compete
   to predict benefits and, thus, feature-benefit associations will develop
   interdependently. We find adaptive learning of feature-benefit
   associations when consumers are motivated to learn to predict a benefit
   (e.g., because it is perceived to have hedonic relevance) but find HAM
   learning when consumers attend to an associate of lesser motivational
   significance.

AB This article explores gift-giving practices using data collected through
   interviews in Hong Kong. I argue that Chinese culture promotes the
   familial over the private self and that the attainment of
   family-oriented goals represents an important measure of
   self-realization and self-fulfillment. Although each individual also has
   a private or inner self (chi), it is also subject to the collective
   will. This idea is in keeping with Confucian ideals that encourage the
   individual to focus on developing internal moral constraints and
   conquering selfishness in the pursuit of social propriety. Furthermore,
   the boundaries of the familial self are permeable and may include
   others, such as important romantic partners and, occasionally, close
   friends who become "like family." In family and like-family contexts,
   reciprocity is discouraged, and there is no need to build relationships
   through gift giving. Our research also suggests, however, that there are
   various gradations of intimacy in gift relationships against the
   backdrop of important cultural rules such as reciprocity, sentiment, and
   face. Using the categories provided by our participants, the gift
   continuum includes "close friends," "good friends," "just
   friends"/"hi-bye friends," and the "romantic other."

AB Four experiments were conducted to examine the persuasive impact of new
   product appeals containing an analogy. An analogy highlights the
   similarity in the benefits offered by a familiar base product and an
   unfamiliar target product. This device is found to be persuasive when
   (a) message recipients have the ability to map attribute relations from
   some base category to understand the benefits of a target product, and
   (b) they allocate the substantial resources needed to complete this
   mapping. In the absence of either of these conditions, the persuasive
   impact of an analogy is more limited. A variety of devices, including
   expertise with the base product, training in how to process base
   information, and a positive mood, are shown to improve the comprehension
   of an analogy and to enhance its persuasiveness.

   conditions that are most conducive to aggregate customization. The

   customization results in better estimates of individual parameters and

AB This article examines a psycholinguistic model of bilingual concept
   organization and extends it to the processing of advertisements by
   bilingual consumers. The model suggests that second-language (L2)
   messages result in inferior memory as compared with first-language (L1)
   stimuli. These language asymmetries in memory are thought to occur
   because processing an L2 message at a conceptual level is less likely
   than processing an L1 message conceptually. Applying this notion to
   advertisements, this research examines picture-text congruity as a
   potential moderator of language effects in memory. The results suggest
   that a high level of congruity between picture and text facilitates
   conceptual processing of L2 messages, increasing memory for
   second-language ads and thereby reducing the impact of language
   asymmetries on memory.

AB Although price-matching refund policies are common in many retail
   environments, the impact of such policies on consumers has largely been
   ignored. This article reports the results of three studies that examine
   price-matching policies from a consumer perspective. Study 1 shows that
   consumers perceive price-matching policies as signals of low store
   prices and that the presence of a refund increases the likelihood of
   discontinuing price search. Contrary to the predictions based on
   signaling theory in information economics, studies 2 and 3 show that
   when search costs are low, the number of stores searched increases in
   the presence versus absence of a price-matching policy. When search
   costs are high, consumers appear to accept the price-matching signal at
   face value and search less in the presence of a refund. The article
   concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of the findings and
   suggesting directions for future research.

   to conclude that Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) was not as diverse
   in its references as Journal of Marketing (JM) and Journal of Marketing
   Research (JMR). We reexamine the Tellis et al. conclusions with a
   reference analysis comparison of JCR, JM, and JMR from 1976 to 1995
   using an expanded set of reference diversity indicators at the article
   level of analysis. Our reexamination reveals small or nonsignificant
   differences among the journals in discipline and journal variety. The
   results also indicate that JCR articles are more likely to rely on
   sources that are more conceptually distant from marketing and business
   than are articles in JM or JMR, regardless of time period. Trends over
   time reveal that whereas reference diversity among JCR articles has
   remained relatively stable, reference diversity among JM and JMR
   articles has increased and decreased, respectively, for two out of three
   diversity factors. We also extend the findings of Tellis et al. (1999)
   with a test of the assumption of a positive relationship between
   reference diversity and subsequent article influence using all 228
   articles appearing in JCR from 1991 to 1995. Interestingly, we find that
   reference diversity has both positive and negative effects on article
   influence.

AB Reference price effects on consumer price perceptions are often
   explained by Helson's adaptation-level theory, in which the cognitive
   representation of reference price is the prototype of the relevant
   category. However, recent conceptualizations and empirical evidence
   suggest the possibility of an exemplar model, which may be specified
   using Volkmann's range theory or Parducci's range-frequency theory. In
   two experiments, these three contextual models of reference price
   effects are pitted against one another. Based on the MANOVA and model
   fitting, range-frequency theory accounted for reference price effects
   that the other theories could not, suggesting that consumers compare the
   target price against specific members of the category rather than the
   category prototype. A third experiment demonstrated that range and
   frequency effects are moderated by the stimulus presentation condition,
   suggesting that consumers place greater weight on extreme prices
   anchoring the range for internal reference prices than for external
   reference prices.

AB Consumers often browse through many products (a product context) before
   evaluating a particular target product. We examine the influence of four
   product context characteristics on happiness with a target product:
   pleasantness, sequence, domain match with target (i.e., whether products
   in the context set belong to the same category as the target), and
   context set size. When context and target match, pleasant and improving
   (compared to less pleasant and worsening) contexts induce less happiness
   with the target product. When there is domain mismatch, however, the
   results are reversed. Furthermore, the assimilation effects are
   significantly influenced by set size, but the contrast effects are not.
   While the contrast effects appear to occur by default and appear to be
   driven by a process of comparison, the assimilation effects appear to be
   driven by mood. These effects hold even when perception of domain match
   is manipulated via instructional framing.

AB This article draws on social dilemma theory and reference group theory
   to understand the individual boycott decision and tests the predictions
   stemming from this conceptualization in two experiments. Consistent with
   our predictions, consumers' likelihood of participating in both economic
   and social-issue boycotts is jointly determined by their perceptions of
   the boycott's likelihood of success, their susceptibility to normative
   social influences, and the costs they incur in boycotting. Consumers'
   success perceptions are, in turn, determined by their expectations of
   overall participation and efficacy, as well as the message frame
   inherent in pro-boycott communications. Two key determinants of
   consumers' boycotting costs are their preference for the boycotted
   product and their access to its substitutes. More specifically,
   consumers who are more susceptible to the normative influence exerted by
   the reference group of potential boycotters are more influenced by
   expected overall participation rates in their boycott likelihood.

AB Ironically, when consumers turn to an information source to assist in
   decision making, they are faced with the added responsibility of having
   to make a decision about the information source itself. A normative
   model is presented that shows that consumer assessment of an information
   source should include both the task for which an information source is
   sought and the appropriate probability of success for the task. A key
   distinction between tasks is whether or not the consumer knows the
   agents' (or prospective agents') ratings of the alternative in question
   at the time of his or her assessment of the information source. A series
   of experiments is presented that examines consumer assessment of the
   diagnosticity of one type of information source, consumer agents (e.g.,
   movie critics and stock analysts) across the three common tasks of
   seeking recommendations, seeking evaluations, and choosing between
   agents who have provided conflicting advice. Results show that consumers
   frequently select inferior agents for providing recommendations and
   choose product alternatives that should be avoided because of a failure
   to recognize when a task calls for a conditional rather than overall
   assessment of agent prior performance. A final study attempts to isolate
   the reasons for these shortcomings by examining the process underlying
   consumer diagnosticity assessment of information sources. Implications
   and future research to address and improve consumer assessment of
   information sources across tasks are discussed.

AB Research supports the existence of a "moderate incongruity effect" such
   that an option that is moderately inconsistent with an evoked product
   category schema is sometimes preferred to a congruent option. We propose
   that perceived risk is an important situational factor that moderates
   the impact of congruity on evaluations. Three studies show that the
   positive evaluation of moderately incongruent products, relative to
   congruent ones, does not appear when there is risk associated with
   product selection. When consumers perceive high risk associated with a
   purchase, the moderate incongruity effect is reversed such that the
   congruent is preferred to the moderately incongruent product. Only in
   conditions where subjects perceived no real risk did the positive effect
   of moderate incongruity appear. The limiting effect of perceived risk
   appears to be due to consumers' "preferences for the norm" under
   high-risk conditions. The set of findings are discussed as they relate
   to and extend current thinking about the effects of moderate incongruity

AB Many technological innovations introduce attributes that are novel or
   completely unknown to a large number of consumers. For example, recently
   introduced attributes such as GPS in cars or I-Link in computers are
   likely to have been novel to many consumers. Past research suggests that
   the addition of novel attributes is likely to improve product evaluation
   and sales, since consumers interpret these attributes as additional
   benefits provided by the manufacturer. However, this article
   demonstrates that the positive effect of novel attributes holds only in
   the case of low-complexity products. In the case of high-complexity
   products, the addition of novel attributes can actually reduce product
   evaluation because of negative learning-cost inferences about these
   attributes. Further, the positive and negative effects of novel
   attributes on product evaluation are accentuated by external search for
   information when the information discovered through search is ambiguous
   in nature. Finally, it is shown that the negative effect of novel
   attributes on the evaluation of high-complexity products can persist
   even after consumers are given explicit information about the benefits
   of novel attributes. A key marketing implication of these findings is
   that novel attributes may contribute to technophobia, or consumer
   resistance toward technological innovation.

AB Two field studies investigate the importance of social presence (real
   and imagined) and familiarity with the purchase act in producing
   embarrassment in the context of an embarrassing product purchase. The
   results indicate that awareness of a social presence during purchase
   selection and commitment, whether real or imagined, is a motivating
   factor in creating embarrassment for the consumer. Further, our results
   show that the more familiar consumers are with an embarrassing product
   purchase, the less embarrassed they are likely to feel. Familiarity with
   an embarrassing product purchase is also shown to have implications for
   the effect of social presence. That is, familiarity with purchase acts
   as a moderator for the relationship of real social presence and
   embarrassment by reducing the influence of the social presence. In the
   context of an imagined social presence, purchase familiarity is shown to
   reduce the likelihood of imagining. These findings are integrated into a
   discussion of the theoretical implications and the potential avenues for
   future research in the area.

   implications of these processing differences within a single language,
   Korean, where words can be written in the alphabetic Hangul or in the
   logographic Hancha. These experiments examine contextual interference
   from auditory and visual stimuli, relational memory between brand names
   and auditory and visual brand identifiers, and two qualitative
   processing outcomes, serial-order memory and spatial-relational memory.

   choice experience during which the consumer finds the object of choice
   to be a perfect fit or to fit like a glove. The article seeks to expand
   consumer research's repertoire of choice models to grasp more
   effectively such choices. Practice theory, which emphasizes the
   sociohistorical and embodied qualities of everyday experience, is used
   to develop the Fits-Like-a-Glove (FLAG) framework of choice. Overall,
   the data suggest that FLAG choice entails an embodied, holistic
   experience of perfect fit arising during a consumer's in situ encounter
   with an object of choice. FLAG choice is explained by highlighting the
   sociohistorical shaping of this encounter. By comparing and contrasting
   it with dominant models of choice in consumer research, the implications
   of the FLAG framework of choice are brought into relief.

AB One of the greatest challenges in advertising health-related information
   is overcoming the target audiences' self-positivity bias (i.e., the
   tendency for people to believe that they are invulnerable to disease).
   In this article, we show that the self-positivity bias hinders message
   processing, and we demonstrate that message cues can reduce this bias
   and engage people in more precautionary thinking and behavior. We
   identify the process by which risk-behavior cues provided in the message
   affect people's estimates of their vulnerability (self-risk estimates),
   depth of message processing, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. We
   test and find support for our theory in three studies that specify the
   types of risk behaviors that make the contraction of a disease seem easy
   versus difficult (study 1), that examine their interactive effects with
   the number of risk behaviors that are enumerated (study 2), and that
   delineate the underlying process by which these effects manifest (study
   3). We demonstrate that the self-positivity bias acts as an a priori
   hypothesis on the basis of which people process and test incoming
   risk-behavior information, as would be predicted by confirmatory
   hypothesis testing theory. Our findings affect the theoretical
   understanding of how memory- and message-based factors work in opposing
   ways and suggest a more comprehensive framework for understanding
   memory- versus message-based judgments. Our results also have
   implications for media strategy and public health policy by
   differentiating between commonly used risk-behavior messages that are
   beneficial to the communicator's goals (e. g., increase compliance) and
   those that are detrimental to the communicator's goals (e. g., decrease
   compliance).

AB This article extends postmodern theories of consumption-oriented
   microcultures by analyzing the natural health value system and the
   microcultural meanings through which it is constructed. We first compare
   our theoretical approach to the conventional, Rokeachian view of the
   consumer value system. Drawing from a range of cultural and postmodern
   theories, we argue that the Rokeachian view is not sufficiently attuned
   to the meaning-based aspects of consumer value systems. Furthermore, it
   largely ignores the intracultural diversity among consumer value systems
   that arises from the fragmentation of postmodern consumer culture into
   diverse consumption microcultures. Our analysis focuses on the
   narratives that natural health consumers use to articulate the values
   manifest in their wellness-oriented consumption outlooks and practices.
   These narratives reveal the meaning-based linkages between these
   articulated values and the consumption goals being pursued through
   natural health practices. We further contextualize the natural health
   value system by highlighting four higher-order postmodern orientations
   that are inflected in this microculture. We discuss the implications of
   our analysis for conceptualizations of the fragmented postmodern
   marketplace, means-end analyses of consumer values, and generative
   theories of consumer goal formation.

AB Previous research demonstrates that rhetorical figures differentially
   affect the extent of ad processing. Specifically, tropes (a type of
   figure) deviate more from expected language use than schemes, with the
   greater deviation yielding more extensive ad processing. We extend
   previous research in two ways by focusing on the incongruity differences
   that exist between schemes and tropes. Study 1 uses syndicated data
   (Starch readership scores) to test how figures combine to affect the
   extent of processing. Results show that when figures leverage unique
   mechanisms (i.e., schemes and tropes), their combination yields
   incremental processing gains. Alternatively, when figures leverage
   redundant mechanisms (e. g., multiple tropes), their combination yields
   no incremental processing. Study 2 is an experiment that tests how
   figures separate in affecting the focus of ad processing. Results show
   that schemes generate a generalized focus on the entire ad, including
   both ad-stylistic and message-related aspects, while tropes generate a
   more selective focus on message-related aspects.

AB Sensory attributes, such as sound quality ascertained by listening to a
   stereo, are often ambiguous and therefore difficult to encode and
   retrieve. Despite this, consumers often place more weight on these
   attributes compared to verbally described market information when making
   brand choice decisions. Results from two studies demonstrate that
   providing criteria to evaluate the sound quality of competing brands of
   stereos facilitates the encoding, retrieval, and alignment of the
   sensory attribute in a brand choice task. Study 1 shows that without
   criteria to evaluate sound quality during trial, memory for this
   attribute is poor. Further, perceptions of sound quality assimilate to
   conflicting market information, which adversely affects decision
   performance. The reverse is true when evaluative criteria and a scheme
   to rate the criteria are provided: memory for sound quality improves,
   perceptions of sound quality contrast with conflicting market
   information, more weight is placed on sound quality when decision
   making, and better choices are made. Study 2 shows that providing
   evaluative criteria during product trial enhances performance through
   improvement in the encoding process.

AB When consumers try to assess the performance of a product on a key

   information and irrelevant information. Although one would expect
   irrelevant information to have little impact on predictions of product
   performance, we present evidence that the irrelevant information
   systematically weakens consumers' beliefs that the product will provide
   the benefit. We show that this dilution effect persists after subjects
   have acknowledged the irrelevance of the additional information but that
   it does depend on whether the product information is processed with the
   desired benefit in mind. We conclude that consumers are selectively
   looking for information that suggests the product will deliver the
   desired benefit and that they categorize any additional evidence, be it
   irrelevant or disconfirming, as not confirming. As a consequence,
   irrelevant information weakens consumers' beliefs in the product's
   ability to deliver the benefit.

AB This research sheds insight on the psychological impact of mixed
   emotions on attitudes. In three experiments, we show that persuasion
   appeals that highlight conflicting emotions (e.g., both happiness and
   sadness) lead to less favorable attitudes for individuals with a lower
   propensity to accept duality (e.g., Anglo Americans, younger adults)
   relative to those with a higher propensity (e.g., Asian Americans, older
   adults). The effect appears to be due to increased levels of felt
   discomfort that arise for those with a lower, but not higher, propensity
   to accept duality when exposed to mixed emotional appeals. Theoretical
   implications regarding boundary conditions of emotional dissonance and
   distinctions between emotional and cognitive dissonance are discussed.

AB Solomon (1983) proposed that products, as social stimuli, influence
   reflected appraisals. Appraisals, in turn, influence self-definition.
   Kleine, Kleine, and Kernan (1993, study 2) empirically supported
   Solomon's hypothesis. Appraisals were found to completely mediate the
   relationship between possessions and self-definition. Appraisals are
   thus an essential link between possession sets and individuals'
   self-definitions. The current study extends the Kleine et al. (1993)
   model in two important ways. First, we combined insights from identity
   theory, appraisal theory, and the sociology of emotions literatures to
   offer a more precise and comprehensive conceptualization of the
   appraisal process that includes both cognitive and emotional components.
   The conceptualization distinguishes appraisals of possessions from
   appraisals of performance and reflected versus self-appraisals. Second,
   symbolic interactionist theory suggests that social interactions and
   media are social communication discourses that, like possessions,
   influence self-definitions via appraisals. The extended model
   incorporates these possibilities. Data collected from individuals with
   an identity based on one of two freely chosen athletic activities
   provides encouraging support for the extended model. The result pattern
   provides insights into how appraisals mediate the relationship between
   social communication discourses and self-definition.

AB Self-control is a promising concept for consumer research, and
   self-control failure may be an important cause of impulsive purchasing.
   Three causes of self-control failure are described. First, conflicting
   goals and standards undermine control, such as when the goal of feeling
   better immediately conflicts with the goal of saving money. Second,
   failure to keep track of (monitor) one's own behavior renders control
   difficult. Third, self-control depends on a resource that operates like
   strength or energy, and depletion of this resource makes self-control
   less effective. Trait differences in self-control predict many
   behaviors. Implications for theory and research in consumer behavior are
   discussed.

AB Brands are today under attack by an emerging countercultural movement.
   This study builds a dialectical theory of consumer culture and branding
   that explains the rise of this movement and its potential effects.
   Results of an interpretive study challenge existing theories of consumer
   resistance. To develop an alternative model, I first trace the rise of
   the modern cultural engineering paradigm of branding, premised upon a
   consumer culture that granted marketers cultural authority. Intrinsic
   contradictions erased its efficacy. Next I describe the current
   postmodern consumer culture, which is premised upon the pursuit of
   personal sovereignty through brands, I detail five postmodern branding
   techniques that are premised upon the principle that brands are
   authentic cultural resources, Postmodern branding is now giving rise to
   new contradictions that have inflamed the antibranding sentiment
   sweeping Western countries, I detail these contradictions and project
   that they will give rise to a new post-postmodern branding paradigm
   premised upon brands as citizen-artists.

AB In multidimensional unfolding multidimensional scaling (MDS) procedures,
   the predicted utility of a brand for a consumer is inversely related to
   the distance between that consumer's ideal point and the brand position
   in the derived space. Most MDS models treat all brands the same
   regardless of their respective market share. In many product categories,
   however, consumer preferences are heavily influenced by the size of the
   existing market share (i.e., the brand mass). This article presents two
   versions of a new spatial methodology that incorporates the effects of
   brand as well as consumer mass via a spatial gravity model of consumer
   utility; that is, the attraction of a brand for a consumer depends not
   only on the distance of the brand from a consumer's ideal point but also
   on the current market size of the brand, as well as the consumer
   purchase pattern and volume. One version of the proposed model estimates
   brand positions and individual ideal points with two-way or three-way
   pick any/N binary choice data. The second version we develop provides
   the same spatial decomposition for two-way or three-way metric
   preference/dominance data. We also develop a series of nested MDS models
   to estimate, test, and compare four different model structures with
   respect to any common data set. We illustrate the proposed methodology
   using an actual commercial application involving physician prescription
   behavior and examine competing model fits.

AB This research examines one aspect of the common but relatively
   understudied consumer behavior context of group interaction. We argue
   and demonstrate that the mere anticipation of group discussion can
   influence people's product attitudes. This occurs because anticipating
   discussion shifts people's focus toward the criteria dominating what
   they are mentally rehearsing to discuss. Such a shift is important
   because people commonly refer primarily to less important information
   when they explain or prepare to discuss their attitudes. Three studies
   demonstrate that when people are forming an attitude toward a product
   while anticipating discussion, this focus on less important information
   substantially affects people's attitudes toward the product. As a
   result, depending on the evaluative implications of what is rehearsed,
   anticipating group discussion can lead to attitudes that are more
   extreme, more moderate, or similar to those of people not anticipating
   discussion. Moreover, when the criteria predominantly rehearsed for
   discussion do not represent how consumers typically evaluate the
   products, attitudes affected by the group-anticipation context do not
   correspond to product judgments made outside of the group-anticipation
   context.

AB The decision-making literature has consistently reported that decisions
   to maintain the status quo tend to be regretted less than decisions to
   change it. We examine the consequences of repeat purchasing (maintaining
   the status quo) versus switching in the context of information regarding
   the reason for the decision (e.g,, prior consumption episode, brand
   history), and we argue that there are situations in which repeat
   purchasing may cause as much or even more regret than switching, We
   contend that this effect depends on whether or not there is a
   justifiable basis for the decision. In a series of four studies we show
   that if there is sufficient motivation to warrant a switch, consumers
   bill feel less regret in the face of a subsequent negative outcome
   realized via a switch than in one realized via a repeat purchase. Our
   results imply that feelings of regret are mitigated when the consumer
   reflects and concludes that the decision was appropriate under the
   circumstances.

AB We present a conceptual as well as empirical analysis showing that
   11-12-year-old children, relative to adults, evaluate brand extensions
   by relying more on surface cues (e.g., brand name characteristics used
   to launch the extension) and less on deep cues (e.g., category
   similarity between the parent brand and the extension category). In
   experiment 1, children gave equivalent evaluations of brand extensions
   regardless of category similarity (e.g., Coca-Cola extending to iced tea
   vs. toffee), whereas adults rated near extensions (e.g., iced tea) more
   favorably than far extensions (e.g., toffee). In experiment 2, children
   evaluated near extensions more favorably than far extensions when they
   were cued to make similarity judgments prior to evaluation but rated
   near and far extensions equivalently when they were not cued prior to
   evaluation. In experiment 3, children based their evaluations on the
   extension name's linguistic characteristics regardless of category
   similarity, whereas adults based their evaluations on category
   similarity regardless of name characteristics. Children rated extensions
   with a rhyming name (e.g., "Coca-Cola Gola" iced tea; "Wrigley's Higley"
   toffee) more positively than extensions with a nonrhyming name (e.g.,
   "Coca-Cola Higley" iced tea; 'Wrigley's Gola" toffee), whereas adults
   rated them similarly. Theoretical implications on branding and
   categorization research as well as managerial implications are

   proposition-probability model( PPM) of argument structure and message
   acceptance in which verbal arguments are decomposed into arrays of three
   types of propositions: (a) product claims, (b) data supporting those
   claims, and (c) conditional rules specifying the relationship between
   the data and the claims. The propositions making up a given argument can
   be stated, entailed, presupposed, conversationally implicated, and/or
   linguistically signaled. Message acceptance is based on the formation
   and/or modification of beliefs corresponding to the propositions in a
   given argument. For purposes of making precise predictions regarding the
   effectiveness of various argument structures, these beliefs are
   represented in terms of probabilities associated with each proposition.
   Several postulates are derived from the PPM, and directions for future

AB Prior research has examined consumers' use of self-control to avoid
   hedonic (myopic) temptations, such as overspending and smoking. In this
   research we investigate the opposite form of self-control, whereby
   consumers force themselves to indulge and avoid default forms of
   spending on utilitarian necessities and/or savings. In particular,
   consumers who have difficulty choosing items that are perceived as
   indulgences or luxuries (e. g., a cruise) over necessities (e. g.,
   saving for college education) and cash in everyday decisions may use
   precommitments to indulgence, especially when the psychological cost of
   such commitments is less concrete. These propositions were tested in a
   series of studies involving real and hypothetical choices as well as
   process measures. The results indicate that a substantial segment of
   consumers choose hedonic luxury rewards over cash of equal or greater
   value; consumers typically explain such choices based on the need to
   precommit to indulgence, to make sure that the award does not end up in
   the pool of money used for necessities. In addition, consistent with our
   analysis, the likelihood of precommitting to indulgence is enhanced when
   (a) the consequences of the decision will be realized farther in the
   future, (b) the odds of winning the reward are lower, and (c) consumers
   anticipate how they will use each possible award. We also show that
   awards representing indulgence are more effective than cash as
   incentives for participation in a (real) lottery. The theoretical and
   practical implications of the results are discussed.

   subculture, members of subcultures are posited to possess knowledge of

   expected to be similar to those of members of the dominant culture.
   However, because members of the dominant culture are not as familiar
   with the subculture, their reactions to cues contained in
   subculture-targeted ads will differ from those of members of the

   cues activate highly internalized dominant cultural models for all

   However, subculture source and nonsource cues interact to activate
   subcultural knowledge, induce self-referencing, and enhance ad attitudes

   been extensively documented under conditions of moderate to high
   processing involvement in the literature, its robustness in consumer
   environments may be overstated. Specifically, there are important
   differences between the experimental settings in which this effect has
   typically been obtained and marketplace conditions. For instance,
   subjects in past studies have typically evaluated unknown or
   hypothetical targets with the goal of forming an accurate impression. In
   the marketplace, consumers may be familiar with brands and likely to
   process brand-related information with a variety of other processing
   goals, such as impression and defense motivation. Using two experiments,
   this re-inquiry delineates conditions under which the negativity effect

   experiments, increased choice of a particular option (e.g., lower price,
   brand name, or compromise option) was associated with relatively
   decreased choice of that same (generic) option on occasions that
   followed. Results indicate that this inherent rule variability is not an
   effect of background contrast but instead relates to consumers'
   favorable valuation of decision change itself. This research implies
   that the idea of contingent decision making applies not only to decision
   outcomes but also to decision processes.

   experimental approach called the theater methodology. Results show that
   the modality of presentation (visual and auditory) of the placements and
   the degree of connection between a brand and the plot of the show
   interact to influence memory and attitude change. Memory improves when
   modality and plot connection are incongruent but persuasion is enhanced
   by congruency. While congruous placements appear natural, incongruent
   placements adversely affect brand attitudes because they seem out of
   place and are discounted.

AB This article examines systematic differences in people's spending
   behavior when using foreign currencies. Rather than overspend or
   underspend in general, we show that individuals' valuation of a product
   in an unfamiliar foreign currency is biased toward its nominal value-its
   face value-with inadequate adjustment for the exchange rate. This leads
   to underspending when the face value of a foreign currency is a multiple
   of an equivalent unit of a home currency ( e. g., 4 Malaysian ringgits =
   1 U. S. dollar) and overspending when it is a fraction (e.g., .4
   Bahraini U. S. dollar). Four studies demonstrate the robustness of the
   face value dinar = 1 effect across different currencies, exchange rate
   frames, and with samples from two countries, and two studies show that
   ability-related factors such as time pressure and experience moderate
   the face value effect. The article concludes by discussing the
   theoretical implications of the findings.

AB Over the past decade, materialism has emerged as an important research
   topic. Materialism is generally viewed as the value placed on the
   acquisition of material objects. Previous research finds that high
   levels of material values are negatively associated with subjective
   well-being. However, relatively little is known about the relationship
   between materialism and well-being within the broader context of an
   individual's value system. In this article, we examine the relationship
   between material values and other important life values. In addition, we
   draw on values theory to examine a novel conceptualization of why
   materialism is antithetical to well-being. Specifically, our theory
   proposes that the individual orientation of material values conflicts
   with collective-oriented values, such as family values and religious
   values. This state of values conflict creates psychological tension, and
   this tension is associated with a reduced sense of well-being. Using
   both a survey sample of 373 adults from across the United States and an
   experimental study of 120 college students, we find considerable support
   for this conflicting values perspective.

   dictates the effect of repeated feature exposure on their judgments.
   When repeated exposures to features are processed in a shallower

   critically reconsidered through examining and interpreting ethnographic
   fieldwork and the consumer accounts of 44 gay men interviewed during a
   study of a gay urban community. Original insights are developed in
   relation to consuming in a subcultural context. The findings include
   consideration of the following key aspects of subcultural consumption:
   (1) contested meanings of gay subcultural consumption, (2) consuming and
   constructing subcultural boundaries, and (3) negotiating individual
   distinction with consumption practices. Overall, findings indicate that
   the oppositional character of subcultural consumption is captured well
   by the proposed theoretical framework that takes into account contested
   meaning clusters; fluid subcultural boundaries; flexible subcultural,
   interpretive frameworks for consuming; and negotiation of individual
   tastes through subcultural consumption.

AB Calling consumers' attention to their cultural identity can make them
   aware of their membership in a group and, therefore, can induce a group
   mind-set. This mind-set, in turn, leads them to make decisions that
   minimize the risk of negative outcomes to both themselves and others.
   The effects of this mind-set generalize over both group and individual
   choice situations. These possibilities were confirmed in a series of six
   experiments. Results showed that making people feel part of an ad hoc
   group increased not only their use of equality as a basis for allocating
   resources to themselves and others, but also their tendency to
   compromise in individual consumer choice situations. Moreover, calling
   Asian and Western participants' attention to their cultural identity
   also induced feelings of being part of a group and, as a result, had
   analogous effects on decisions in both group and consumer choice

   constituting). The second assumes that the consumer is imprisoned by the
   signs and codes of the historical moment (i.e., the consumer is
   constituted). The dialectical and discursive tension between these two
   perspectives is used as an orienting framework in the hermeneutic
   analyses of 14 phenomenological interviews. Thompson and Haytko's (1997)
   findings/claims remain pertinent in a professional, middle-class
   context. In addition, this research contributes to their lived hegemony
   premise by emphasizing the dominating tendencies of marketing systems.

   experience is viewed as nonpartisan, devoid of the didacticism of formal
   education and the self-serving interests of advertisers. Third, much of
   experience is ambiguous, but not recognized as such. Experience supports
   a pseudodiagnosticity that draws the consumer in as a willing partner in

   be perceived as subjectively more valuable as the need for it
   intensifies. For example, the more active the need to eat, the more
   valuable food will become. This outcome could be called a valuation
   effect. In this article, we suggest a second basic influence of needs on
   evaluations: that activating a focal need (e.g., to eat) makes objects
   unrelated to that need (e.g., shampoo) less valuable, an outcome we
   refer to as the devaluation effect. Two existing studies support the
   existence of a devaluation effect using manipulations of the need to eat
   and to smoke and measuring attractiveness of consumer products and
   willingness to purchase raffle tickets. Furthermore, the evidence
   suggests that consumers are not aware of the devaluation effect and its
   influence on their preferences.

AB Queues are a ubiquitous phenomenon. This research investigates
   consumers' affective experiences in a queue and their decisions to leave
   the queue after having spent some time in it (reneging). In particular,
   we find in our first two studies that, as the number of people behind
   increases, the consumer is in a relatively more positive affective state
   and the likelihood of reneging is lower. While a number of explanations
   may account for this effect, we focus on the role of social comparisons.
   In particular, we expect consumers in a queue to make downward
   comparisons with the less fortunate others behind them. We propose that
   three types of factors influence the degree of social comparisons made
   and thus moderate the effect of the number behind: (a) queue factors
   that influence the ease with which social comparisons can be made, (b)
   individual factors that determine the personal tendency to make social
   comparisons, and (c) situational factors that influence the degree of
   social comparisons through the generation of counterfactuals. Across
   three studies, we find support for each moderating effect. We conclude
   with a discussion on theoretical implications and limitations, and we
   propose avenues for future research.

AB This re-inquiry examines the robustness of research showing that
   rhetorical figures such as rhyme and metaphor can have a positive impact
   on consumer response to advertising. Prior empirical research explicitly
   directed subjects to process the ads and generally examined either
   visual or verbal rhetoric, but not both. We embedded ads containing
   visual and verbal figures in a 32-page magazine designed to be
   interesting to subjects and manipulated directed processing or
   incidental exposure to the ads. Ads with figures were recalled more
   often and liked better. Visual figures were more effective regardless of
   processing condition, whereas verbal figures performed better only when
   subjects were directed to process the ads.

AB Self-reports are a key source of information in consumer research.
   Unfortunately, self-reports are highly context dependent, and this
   problem is compounded when comparisons across cohorts or cultures are of
   interest. Age-related changes in cognitive functioning and cultural
   differences in cognition and communication influence the response
   process, resulting in differential context effects that may reverse the
   ordinal placement of cohorts or cultures on the measure of interest. Any
   observed difference between age groups or cultures may therefore reflect
   a meaningful difference in attitudes or behaviors, a difference in the
   response process, or an unknown mix of both.

AB The increased priority placed on branding by marketers in recent years
   offers an opportunity for consumer researchers to provide valuable
   insights and guidance. In particular, in highly competitive
   marketplaces, marketers often must link their brands to other entities,
   for example, people, places, things, or other brands, as a means to
   improve their brand equity. Understanding this leveraging process
   requires understanding consumer brand knowledge and how it changes from
   such associations. In this essay, I identify some promising and
   productive current research on this topic, and I suggest some important
   issues for future research. I conclude that adopting broader, more
   holistic perspectives that synthesize the multidimensionality of brand
   knowledge is critical to advance branding theory and practice, both in
   general and with brand leveraging in particular.

   it can be traded for a desired outcome. Experiments demonstrate that,
   when people are faced with options entailing different outcomes, the
   presence of a medium can alter what option they choose. This effect
   occurs because the medium presents an illusion of advantage to an
   otherwise not so advantageous option, an illusion of certainty to an
   otherwise uncertain option, or an illusion of linearity to an otherwise

AB Common sense suggests that consumers make more satisfying decisions as
   they consider their options more closely. Yet we argue that such close
   consideration can have undesirable consequences because it may induce
   attachment to the options-a sense of prefactual ownership of the choice
   options. When consumers then select one option, they effectively lose
   this prefactual possession of the other, nonchosen options. This yields
   a feeling of discomfort ("choosing feels like losing") and an increase
   in the attractiveness of the forgone option, compared to its appeal
   before the choice. A series of nine experiments provides evidence of
   this phenomenon and support for our explanation.

AB Recent consumer research suggests that lowering search costs for quality
   information reduces consumer price sensitivity by creating greater
   perceived differentiation among brands (e.g., Kaul and Wittink 1995;
   Lynch and Ariely 2000). We argue that lowering quality search costs by
   smart agents can have the opposite effect on differentiation and price
   sensitivity. Smart agents screen through a universe of alternatives,
   recommending only a handful well-matched to the customer's quality
   preferences. In this research, we ask and answer the following
   questions: In markets in which price and quality are uncorrelated, will
   the use of screening agents increase or decrease prices paid compared to
   searching from an unordered list of options? Will increasing the size of
   the store's underlying assortment increase or decrease prices paid when
   options have been screened on quality? In markets where higher priced
   goods have higher quality, will the use of screening agents increase or
   decrease prices paid and quality selected? Experiments 1 and 2 test the
   effect of quality screening when price and quality are uncorrelated. We
   then present an analytic model for markets in which price and quality
   are correlated. We deduce that ordering can cause price and quality to
   increase or decrease depending on the slope of the price-quality
   relationship in comparison with the relative importance of price in the
   utility function. We find support for this model in experiment 3.

AB Most measures of consumer behavior have been developed and employed in
   the United States. Thus, relatively little is known about the
   cross-cultural applicability of these measures. Using Richins and
   Dawson's (1992) Material Values Scale (MVS) as an exemplar, this article
   focuses on the problems researchers are likely to encounter when
   employing domestic mixed-worded scales (i.e., scales that contain both
   positive- and reverse-worded items) in cross-cultural applications.
   Through an initial study among over 800 adults from the United States,
   Singapore, Thailand, Japan, and Korea, we show that the cross-cultural
   measurement equivalence and construct validity of the MVS is challenged
   by its mixed-worded Likert format. Through a second study among
   approximately 400 Americans and East Asians, we find that other
   mixed-worded scales produce similar problems and that the cross-cultural
   applicability of such scales may be enhanced by replacing items posed as
   statements with items framed as questions.

   of quality and monetary sacrifice exhibit different response patterns

   Several factors, including advertising, word-of-mouth, market growth,

   are consistent with the predictions of two enhanced processing
   explanations of learning-the retrieval hypothesis and the reconstruction
   hypothesis. These two hypotheses predict that an effective repetition
   strategy should encourage incidental processing during one presentation
   of the material and intentional processing during the other presentation
   of the material, but the hypotheses differ about the optimal order of
   these two types of processing. Thus, the most effective repetition

   congruency between users' goals and the delivery of product information
   will influence discursive processing and thus attitudes. However, what
   is most effective for creating favorable product attitudes is not
   necessarily most effective in raising purchase intentions. This is
   because imagery processing should play a more prominent role in
   affecting purchase intentions because, when estimating their own

   trade-offs between benefits (i. e., to be compensatory), the consumer
   often delays making a decision about which benefits are preferable, and
   the consideration set tends to contain a more diverse set of
   alternatives. We document several factors that influence the relative
   importance of one or the other motive in consideration set formation and
   discuss implications for brand managers.

AB This article focuses on somatic experience-not just the process of
   thinking bodily but how the body informs the logic of thinking about
   art. We examine the links between embodiment, movement, and multisensory
   experience insofar as they help to elucidate the contours of art
   appreciation in a museum. We argue that embodiment can be identified at
   two levels: the phenomenological and the cognitive unconscious. At the
   first level, individuals are conscious of their feelings and actions
   while, at the second level, sensorimotor and other bodily oriented
   inference mechanisms inform their processes of abstract thought and
   reasoning. We analyze the consumption stories of 30 museum goers in
   order to understand how people move through museum spaces and feel,
   touch, hear, smell, and taste art. Further, through an analysis of
   metaphors and the use of conceptual blending, we tap into the
   participants' unconscious minds, gleaning important embodiment processes
   that shape their reasoning.

AB A crucial communication task for unknown brands is to build the

   communication effectiveness may depend on prior familiarity of the
   advertised brand. The findings of two experiments using television ads
   and computer Internet ads revealed that brand familiarity influenced
   repetition effectiveness. In particular, repetition of advertising
   attributed to an unfamiliar brand showed decreased effectiveness; when
   the same advertising was attributed to a known, familiar brand,
   repetition wearout was postponed. Negative thoughts about tactic
   inappropriateness were seen to arise with repetition, particularly for
   an ad for an unfamiliar brand, driving, in part, the decreases in
   repetition effectiveness.

   level of reference values used to evaluate attribute information. When
   the range of reference values is narrower for a positive frame than a

   the positively framed information and attribute values below expected

AB Desire is the motivating force behind much of contemporary consumption.
   Yet consumer research has devoted little specific attention to
   passionate and fanciful consumer desire. This article is grounded in
   consumers' everyday experiences of longing for and fantasizing about
   particular goods. Based on journals, interviews, projective data, and
   inquiries into daily discourses in three cultures ( the United States,
   Turkey, and Denmark), we develop a phenomenological account of desire.
   We find that desire is regarded as a powerful cyclic emotion that is
   both discomforting and pleasurable. Desire is an embodied passion
   involving a quest for otherness, sociality, danger, and inaccessibility.
   Underlying and driving the pursuit of desire, we find self- seduction,
   longing, desire for desire, fear of being without desire, hopefulness,
   and tensions between seduction and morality. We discuss theoretical
   implications of these processes for consumer research.

   sources of variation in consumer trial probability: ( 1) within new
   products, across consumers; ( 2) within new products, over time; and (
   3) across new products. Hypotheses are developed for the different
   variables concerning their likely effect on trial probability. The
   hypotheses are tested on weekly household- panel scanner data on the
   occurrence and timing of first purchases for 239 new consumer packaged
   goods over a 52-week period after introduction for a sample of over
   3,500 consumers. We combine these household panel purchase data with
   consumer questionnaire data, retail scanner data, data on advertising
   expenditure, and expert ratings. We find support for most hypotheses.
   One of our main findings is that the effects of the consumers' personal
   makeup on the probability that they will try the new product are
   systematically moderated by elements of the marketing strategy
   associated with the new product and by category characteristics. The
   extensive data set provides a strong context for the generalizability of
   the findings.

AB This article examines how dynamic changes in information cost structure
   and time preferences affect consumers' search and switching behavior
   over time and lead to lock- in. The information cost structure is
   conceptualized as a trade- off of initial setup costs and ongoing usage
   costs. Lock- in is defined as consumers' decreased propensity to search
   and switch after an initial investment, which is determined both by a
   preference to minimize immediate costs and by an inability to anticipate
   the impact of future switching costs. The results of three experiments
   support the proposed mechanism. Experiment 1 shows that a small initial
   investment is sufficient to produce lock- in. Experiment 2 shows that
   the results of a prior investment on lock- in are not due to
   psychological commitment but to a shift in relative costs of incumbent
   and new options. Experiment 3 shows that respondents fail to anticipate
   how their prior investment will lock them in.

   knowledge ( how long it takes to get there) is both more accessible from
   memory and more accurate than their corresponding driving distance
   knowledge. In memory- based judgments, chronically more accessible time
   knowledge had a dominant influence on distance judgments. Given a map,
   consumers still relied on their time knowledge to infer trip distance.
   Moreover, consumers' estimated time and distance judgments showed
   inflated correlations regardless of underlying actual correlations,

   affects which brands are retrieved when consumers are provided with a
   usage situation. A spreading activation network model of memory is used
   to predict the results of an experiment where the usage situations were
   varied at encoding and repeated recall sessions. The results of the
   study indicate that lower knowledge consumers tend to learn only the
   brand information that is appropriate for a usage situation at encoding
   and do not organize brands by subcategory in memory. Consequently, lower
   knowledge consumers tend to retrieve the same set of brands regardless
   of the usage situation at retrieval. Alternatively, higher knowledge
   consumers learn brand information appropriate for different usage
   situations and organize this information by product subcategories. This
   allows higher knowledge consumers to retrieve the brands appropriate for

   brands as the usage situation changes.

   compared to those given a tall, slender glass, but they perceive the

   designed to increase primary demand, or the "size of the pie," without

   to the contrary - generic advertising increases the consumer's
   sensitivity to changes in price and systematically alters brand
   preferences. These effects of generic advertising can be attributed to
   the tendency of generic ads to change the relative importance of the

AB Most gift-giving research focuses on how aspects of the giver,
   recipient, or their relationship impact gift exchange. This longitudinal
   study of the Christmas giving of five informants demonstrates that
   givers strategically incorporate, or allow themselves to be influenced
   by, third parties when selecting gifts for recipients. Moreover, givers'
   motivations for incorporating these influences can change over time.
   Thus, seemingly personal gifts to recipients actually reflect givers'
   relationships with others in the social network. Our taxonomy of 10
   social influences on givers' behavior, as well as givers' motivations
   and the relational processes associated with each, broadens the scope of
   current gift-giving research and begins exploring how social
   relationships impact gift exchange.

   patterns differed, whereby relationships with sincere brands deepened
   over time in line with friendship templates, and relationships with

   flings. These patterns held only when the relationship proceeded without
   a transgression. Relationships with sincere brands suffered in the wake
   of transgressions, whereas relationships with exciting brands
   surprisingly showed signs of reinvigoration after such transgressions.
   Inferences concerning the brand's partner quality mediated the results.
   Findings suggest a dynamic construal of brand personality, greater

   direct attention on the message source (high salience of the rhetorical

   this article, we propose that in addition to the positive effects, goals
   may also have a counterproductive effect. Specifically, we propose that
   violating one's goal may cause a deterioration of subsequent performance
   as compared to individuals who have no goals. When the violation of
   one's goal is coded as a failure, it can result in demotivation,
   negative emotion, and consequently a poorer performance. We report two
   experiments that demonstrate the counterproductive effects of goals and
   discuss potential moderators of this effect along with several possible

AB Consumers often face emotion-laden choices involving conflicting goals
   of personal importance (e.g., safety). Research suggests that consumers
   cope with the negative emotion associated with these choices by avoiding
   certain behaviors, in particular attribute trade-off making. This
   research investigates a factor that moderates these coping effects. Four
   experiments show that simple cognitive load can make consumers less
   averse to making attribute trade-offs. This research demonstrates,
   counterintuitively, that a reduction of cognitive resources through
   increased load can result in more normative decision behavior. Load
   apparently disinhibits trade-off making by disrupting consumers'
   abilities to consider relevant self goal information and the negative
   emotional consequences of trading off something of personal importance,
   thereby reducing consumers' need to cope.

   similarity in the recent behavioral genetics and developmental
   psychology literature, set competing hypotheses about sibling influence
   on innovativeness and innovative behavior. Using a model tested with

AB When a choice set consists of a distribution of alternatives with

   preferences-they prefer an alternative having moderate costs and
   benefits. Theories disagree about how adding additional lower
   benefit/lower cost or higher benefit/higher cost alternatives to this
   choice set will affect relative preferences for the initial set of
   alternatives. Prototype theory predicts that adding alternatives should
   produce assimilation, whereas multiattribute range-frequency theory
   predicts that it creates contrast. We reconcile these two theories by
   assuming that single-peaked preferences reflect a composition of
   underlying benefit and cost valuations. Moreover, we claim that the
   correlational structure of the benefit and cost dimensions in the
   contextual stimuli determines whether these stimuli will exert an
   assimilation or contrast effect. We show that when benefits and costs
   are correlated (uncorrelated), adding alternatives that extend the range
   of offerings produces assimilation (contrast) for preference judgments.
   We propose a cost-benefit trade-off model that incorporates elements of
   single-peaked preference theory and range-frequency theory to explain
   the complex fashion in which contextual stimuli affect consumer ideals.

   categories that vary in regard to potential uncertainty about attributes
   and associated information acquisition costs and perceived risks of
   consumption. We find that brand credibility increases probability of
   inclusion of a brand in the consideration set, as well as brand choice
   conditional on consideration. We also find that although credibility
   impacts brand choice and consideration set formation more and through
   more constructs in contexts with high uncertainty and sensitivity to
   such uncertainty, credibility effects are present in all categories.
   Finally, our results indicate that trustworthiness, rather than
   expertise, affects consumer choices and brand consideration more.

AB A robust finding in research on message framing is that negatively
   framed messages are more (less) effective than positively framed ones
   when the level of cognitive elaboration is high (low). However, recent
   research presents evidence that is contrary to previous findings:
   negative framing being less (more) effective than positive framing when
   the level of elaboration is high (low). In this article, we attempt to
   resolve the conflicting findings by highlighting the moderating roles of
   motivation and opportunity-related variables on the effectiveness of
   negative versus positive message frames. Results from two experiments
   suggest that under conditions of low processing motivation, negative
   framing is more ( less) effective than positive framing when the level
   of processing opportunity is low ( high). Under conditions of high
   processing motivation, negative framing is more effective than positive
   framing, irrespective of the level of processing opportunity.

   (MVS) developed by Richins and Dawson ( 1992) to examine materialism as
   a facet of consumer behavior. This research examines the MVS in light of
   the accumulated evidence concerning this measure. A review of published
   studies reporting information about the scale and analysis of 15 raw
   data sets that contain the MVS and other measures revealed that the MVS
   performs well in terms of reliability and empirical usefulness, but the
   dimensional structure proposed by Richins and Dawson is not always
   evident in the data. This article proposes a 15-item measure of the MVS
   that has better dimension properties than the original version. It also
   reports the development of a short version of the MVS. Scale lengths of
   nine, six, and three items were investigated. Results indicate that the
   nine-item version possesses acceptable psychometric properties when used
   to measure materialism at a general level. This article also describes a
   psychometric approach for developing shorter versions of extant

   This prediction is based on the assumptions of diminishing marginal

AB Consumers often make decisions based on the extremeness of choice
   alternatives. Prior research has argued that extremeness aversion is a
   function of the relational properties of choice alternatives and that
   the middle option, defined such that its attribute values are between
   the values of the other alternatives, is always viewed as the least
   extreme, compromise option. The attribute-balance hypothesis advanced in
   this article extends prior research, demonstrating that extremeness
   aversion is also a function of the dispersion of attribute values within
   each alternative. In particular, it is argued that an option with equal
   attribute ratings will be perceived as the compromise alternative even
   when it is not the middle option. Data from three studies support this
   prediction, offering converging evidence for the attribute-balance
   effect in different decision contexts. Theoretical implications of the
   findings are discussed in the context of the extant extremeness aversion
   research.

   the seller's value for the property but is still below the reserve.
   Rejoicing occurs when the reserve forces the winning bidder to pay a
   higher price. The impact of regret and rejoicing can be observed by
   examining sellers' learning over sequential auctions, particularly when
   they use a frequency heuristic. Results from an auction experiment with
   simulated bidders support the impact of anticipated regret and rejoicing

   The most successful extensions involve brands that are associated with

   brand extension success also depends on the accessibility of these
   benefit associations and that accessibility, in turn, depends on the
   amount of interference by competing brand associations ( e. g., category
   associations). One implication of this proposition is that broad brands
   (i.e., brands offering a portfolio of diverse products) will tend to
   have more accessible benefit associations than narrow brands (i.e.,
   brands offering a portfolio of similar products) and can therefore
   engage in more successful brand extensions than narrow brands, even when
   the narrow brands are more similar to the extension category. However,
   when benefit associations are equally accessible and diagnostic, the

AB We develop a model describing how certain American men, those men who
   have been described as emasculated by recent socioeconomic changes,
   construct themselves as masculine through their everyday consumption. We
   find that American mass culture idealizes the man-of-action hero - an
   idealized model of manhood that resolves the inherent weaknesses in two
   other prominent models ( the breadwinner and the rebel). The men we
   studied drew from this three-part discourse - what we call the ideology
   of heroic masculinity - to construct themselves in dramatic fashion as
   man-of-action heroes. In addition, we show that these men pursue heroic
   masculinity in very different ways, depending on their social class
   positions.

   ways brands are cocreated in a non-brand-focused community. Collective
   action frames - shared ways of interpreting meanings within social
   interaction - provide the connection between a community and its
   legitimate brands. Informants routinely inscribe some brands with the

   Building on the valence-expectancy framework, we find that
   disconfirmation and attributions impact satisfaction in a complex
   manner. Besides its main effect, responsibility moderates
   disconfirmation's effect on satisfaction, manifested as a two-way
   interaction between the two. Disconfirmation and responsibility jointly
   determine the valence component, and stability determines the expectancy
   component of the satisfaction evaluation. This is consistent with the
   three-way interaction among stability, responsibility, and

AB A consumer choosing a product must often wait before consuming it. In
   this article, we consider the consequences of waiting on consumption
   enjoyment. We propose that the effect of a delay on consumption
   enjoyment depends on both the negative utility of the wait itself and on
   the positive utility of anticipating a pleasant consumption experience.
   These factors exert different degrees of influence, depending on
   characteristics of the decision task. The results of three studies
   suggest that a delay increases consumption enjoyment for pleasurable
   products when actual consumption occurs, but decreases enjoyment for
   imagined consumption. Furthermore, the vividness of the awaited product
   moderates these effects.

   Beyond the specifics of this demographic group and setting, we suggest

AB A default option is the choice alternative a consumer receives if he/she

   defaults can invoke a consumer's "marketplace metacognition," his/her
   social intelligence about marketplace behavior. This metacognitive
   account of defaults leads to different predictions than accounts based
   on cognitive limitations or endowment: in particular, it predicts the
   possibility of negative or "backfire" default effects. In two
   experiments, we demonstrate that the size and direction of the default
   effect depend on whether this social intelligence is invoked and how it
   changes the interpretation of the default.

   concerned about avoiding negative impressions in public settings. They
   respond more favorably to protective messages than do their low SNI
   counterparts, but only when the messages pertain to conspicuous
   benefits. Study 2 suggests that SNI is inversely related to individuals'
   tendencies to exaggerate similarities to their "ought" selves and their
   willingness to portray themselves more favorably than others. Overall,
   these findings suggest that high SNI consumers are averse to calling

   the status quo and a course of action that is a departure from the
   status quo. This research demonstrates that preference for the status
   quo is a function of goal orientation and, in particular, that it tends
   to be more pronounced for prevention-focused than for promotion-focused
   consumers. The preference for the status quo was examined on two
   dimensions: preference for the status quo alternative and preference for
   inaction over action. In this context, it is shown that the impact of
   goal orientation on the preference for the status quo can occur
   independently of loss aversion-a finding consistent with the notion that
   goal orientation might impact choice by virtue of motivational factors
   such as self-regulation of anticipated regret.

   personnel. We conceptualize the consumer target as a goal-directed
   individual who attempts to manage a marketing interaction. Three
   qualitative data sets reveal 15 response strategies reflecting targets
   who are both goal seekers (i.e., attempting to utilize the agent to
   achieve own goals) and persuasion sentries (i.e., guarding against
   unwanted marketing persuasion). The target-agent relationship and the
   target's experience with persuasion emerge as factors that affect

AB The persuasive impact of a negation ("not difficult to use") is shown to

   substantial, a brand is evaluated more favorably when a negation is

   valenced ("not easy to use"). Under limited resources, a negation has no
   effect. Between these extremes in resource allocation, the brand is
   evaluated more favorably when the negation is negatively valenced than
   when it is positively valenced. Further, this outcome under moderate
   resources occurs even though respondents represent the negation
   accurately in memory. These findings provide evidence that the
   processing of a negation follows a specific sequence such that the

AB This article examines the subsequent impact of a temporary price
   discount on brand preference after the promotion is retracted.
   Theorizing that price salience has an impact on price sensitivity, we
   propose that the effects of retracting a discount depend on the promoted
   brand's regular price-quality positioning. In a first experiment in
   which we track consumer choices across a sequence of choice occasions,
   we show that retracting a discount posted by a higher quality, higher
   price brand is detrimental to that brand. In contrast, a discount posted
   by a lower quality, lower price brand is capable of enduringly diverting
   consumers away from high-end brands. A second experiment relies on
   process measures to provide evidence for the underlying price salience
   mechanism. A third experiment tests our hypotheses with real incentives
   and offers additional support for our price salience theory by testing
   its most peculiar behavioral implication.

AB Spectacular, themed environments have been theorized as places where
   play is limited and consumer agency is overpowered. In a
   multiperspectival ethnographic engagement with ESPN Zone Chicago, we
   find consumers resisting the rules, but only to a limited degree.
   Spectacular consumption possesses a do-it-yourself quality unrecognized
   in prior theory. Technology and screens are important to this form of
   play, which exhibits a transcendent character built of liminoid elements
   and consumer fantasy. Yet, even in ostensibly overpowering spectacular
   consumption environments, consumption still is negotiated dialectically;
   consumer and producer interests are embedded in one another in a process
   of "interagency."

AB This article demonstrates that subjective knowledge (i.e., perceived
   knowledge) can affect the quality of consumers' choices by altering
   where consumers search. We propose that subjective knowledge increases
   the likelihood that consumers will locate themselves proximate to
   stimuli consistent with their subjective knowledge. As such, subjective
   knowledge influences choice by affecting search selectivity between
   environments rather than search within the environment. We suggest that
   the need for self-consistency drives this effect of subjective knowledge
   on search. Two lab experiments and one field study find support for the
   effect of subjective knowledge on nutrition search selectivity and
   choice as well as for the role of self-consistency.

   The results of four studies suggest that, although circumstantial
   differences between buying and selling decisions can lead to systematic
   differences in susceptibility to anchoring effects, the principles
   governing the impact of anchoring on WTP and WTA judgments are
   essentially the same. In particular, robust anchoring effects are
   observed when the anchor relates to the focal source of uncertainty.
   Further, WTP and WTA judgments are most susceptible to anchoring ( and

   is proposed that consumers reaffirm their autonomy by choosing rewards
   that are congruent with the promoted consumption effort (choosing reward
   x over reward y, given effort x). Such congruity allows consumers to
   construe their behavior as intrinsically motivated rather than
   externally induced, because the effort is its own reward. Supporting
   this conceptualization, the results indicate that preferences for
   effort-congruent rewards are attenuated among consumers with lower

AB Building on a sociolinguistic framework, our research explores the

   Code-switching refers to mixing languages within a sentence, a common
   practice among bilingual consumers. We investigate how responses to
   different types of code-switched messages can provide insight into
   bilingual consumers' persuasion processes. A pilot study reveals a
   code-switching direction effect such that minority-language slogans
   switching to the majority language result in greater persuasion than
   majority-language slogans switching to the minority language. The effect
   is attributed to the salience of the code-switched word in the slogan.
   Study 1 explores this code-switching direction effect in more detail and
   shows that when associations toward the minority language are positive,
   the code-switching direction effect is reversed.

   We demonstrate, however, that amount of search moderates consumers'

   different orderings exposes consumers to sequences of options
   characterized by different key psychological moments (trend and end) as
   well as to different levels of average quality. Greater search can lead
   to more positive evaluations for improving versus declining orderings
   because consumers experience more positive moments on which to base

AB An annual survey of U. S. consumers' sentiment toward the institution of
   marketing has been conducted for the past two decades. This report
   describes the measuring instrument (which produces a summary index
   number for each year), the sample, and the longitudinal trend of survey
   results - the upshot of which is a pattern of slightly improving
   consumer sentiment toward marketing practice. When also incorporating
   the findings of similar research done prior to this study, a 30 yr.
   historical record emerges. Finally, examination of secondary data
   reveals that selected macroeconomic variables relate strongly to the
   consumer marketing sentiment index.

AB This article provides a synthesizing overview of the past 20 yr. of
   consumer research addressing the sociocultural, experiential, symbolic,
   and ideological aspects of consumption. Our aim is to provide a viable
   disciplinary brand for this research tradition that we call consumer
   culture theory (CCT). We propose that CCT has fulfilled recurrent calls
   for developing a distinctive body of theoretical knowledge about
   consumption and marketplace behaviors. In developing this argument, we
   redress three enduring misconceptions about the nature and analytic
   orientation of CCT. We then assess how CCT has contributed to consumer
   research by illuminating the cultural dimensions of the consumption
   cycle and by developing novel theorizations concerning four thematic
   domains of research interest.

AB Across a variety of domains, consumers often choose to act as the
   designer of their own solution, sourcing the necessary components and
   assembling the parts to meet their specific goals. While thinking
   creatively is an integral part in the daily life of every consumer,
   surprisingly little research in marketing has examined the factors
   influencing such processes. In our research, we examine how input and
   time constraints influence the way in which consumers process
   information during a creative task and how those processes, in turn,
   influence the creativity of the solution. Paradoxically, we find that
   input constraints encourage more creative processing, provided the
   individual is not under significant time constraints.

   depicted objects or the camera angle used. Yet little empirical research
   has explored if this is so, how readily or when such concepts are
   discerned, and/or whether these concepts can affect viewers'
   perceptions. In two studies we show that stylistic properties of ad
   pictures can communicate descriptive concepts that affect perceptions.
   However, this appears to occur only when viewers engage in ample
   processing of the ad and the accessibility of an appropriate descriptive
   concept is heightened, independent of the stylistic property.

AB This research explores a phenomenon that pervades many realms of
   consumer behavior - the various ways that consumers cope with stress and
   negative emotions. In study 1, I generate and test a multidimensional
   scale to measure the coping construct, revealing a more diverse set of
   strategies than accounted for in the consumer literature on coping. I
   test competing theories about the hierarchical structure of the coping
   construct. Study 2 validates these findings and begins to establish
   theoretical links between the coping dimensions and their antecedent
   relationships with discrete emotions. In contrast to extant research
   linking emotions and coping, which has only investigated main effect
   hypotheses, I conceptualize and find empirical evidence for a model in
   which emotions interact with appraisals jointly to enact coping
   strategies. This research contributes to the emerging consumer coping
   literature by enriching existing theoretical conceptualizations of
   consumer coping processes and by validating a scale that should prove
   useful in consumer research.

   nine-ending prices are perceived to be smaller than a price one cent
   higher. First, this occurs only when the leftmost digits of the prices
   differ (e.g., $ 2.99 vs. $3.00). Second, the left-digit effect also
   depends on the numerical and psychological distances between the target
   price and a competing product's price. The closer the two prices being

AB Building on Grice's ( 1975) theory of "conversational implicature," we
   propose that consumers will react favorably to unusual color or flavor
   names ( e. g., blue haze or Alpine snow) because they expect marketing
   messages to convey useful information. If the message is not informative
   or does not conform to expectations, consumers search for the reason for
   the deviation. This search results in additional ( positive)
   attributions about the product, and thus, a more favorable response. The
   results of a series of experiments provide empirical support for our
   proposal and rule out some alternative explanations for the success of
   ambiguous naming strategies.

   The goal of this qualitative study was to examine the intersection of

   strategies that low literate consumers employ. Those informants who
   could challenge the stigma of low literacy and employ a range of coping
   skills were better able to get their needs met. Thus, consumer literacy

   skills but also involves the ability to manage one's identity and
   leverage personal, situational, and social coping skills.

   brand that is considered mundane and blends into the household
   environment. Much as someone might purchase a brand for other reasons (
   e. g., family lineage, low price), people strive for brands that can be
   made invisible in their lives. A 16 mo. ethnography of households and
   their kitchen pantries yields insights into the process that shapes the
   invisible brand. The locus of meaning is in the process of brand
   storage, not in the consumer's identity or in a well-defined
   consumer-brand relationship. The data also suggest that the households
   use storage strategies that parallel camouflaging strategies in nature.

AB This article extends the notion of context effects beyond the relational
   properties of choice alternatives to include attribute balance as a
   reason for choice. The data reported in two experiments demonstrate that
   attribute balance has a significant impact on extremeness-aversion and
   trade-off-contrast effects reported in prior research. The proposition
   that consumers use attribute balance as a reason for choice is further
   supported by the finding that attribute balance moderates the impact of
   justification on the strength of extremeness aversion and trade-off
   contrast. These findings offer a new perspective on the decision
   processes underlying context effects in choice.

AB Gender markers provide syntactic structure and a categorization schema
   to language. Brand name gender is a function of both formal, structural
   aspects of the brand name and semantic properties of the brand's product
   class. In the formal gender system of Spanish, consistent formal gender
   marking enhances brand recall, whereas semantic product associations
   drive brand evaluation. In the semantic gender system of English, formal
   cues determine initial brand name gender, but congruent semantic
   associations between brand name and product category drive improved
   brand evaluations and brand recall. Three studies across two languages
   demonstrate that gender's role as a categorization tool underlies these
   effects.

   have reflexive doubts toward prevailing expert risk assessments and
   gravitate toward alternative models of risk reduction. This study
   explores how dissident health risk perceptions are culturally

   Self-presentational concerns appear to cause this negativity bias:

   In four experiments we found that (a) study-phase retrieval contributes

AB An experiment reveals that the relationship between celebrity attitude
   and attitude toward brands paired with the celebrity's voice is
   moderated by identification of the celebrity but only when attitude is
   measured explicitly. Using explicit measures, celebrity attitude was
   positively (negatively) related to brand attitude change when the
   evaluator could not (could) identify the celebrity. This finding is
   attributed to "resetting," a correction of the perceived influence from
   irrelevant cues. On implicit measures, a positive relationship between
   celebrity and brand attitude was observed regardless of celebrity
   identification. The disassociation between the explicit and implicit
   results suggests that resetting requires explicit evaluation.

   exchange relationships, in which a matched benefit is expected back from

   both a survey and an experiment suggest that television cultivates
   materialism through an online process in which television's influence is

   This finding stands in contrast to the cultivation of prevalence

   (such as watching sports competitions live on television) unfold in ways
   that are not decided ex ante. This makes them more exciting than
   equivalent determinate experiences (such as watching recorded

   independently of other differences between live and taped broadcasts,
   the indeterminacy of events made watching them live more exciting and

   dispositional explanations. Construal models account for the same

AB The Cohen and Reed model of attitudes provides a useful addition to the
   literature. This article relates their framework to a metacognitive
   model of attitudes suggesting that attitude objects are associated not
   only with positive and/or negative evaluative tags but also with
   validity tags. According to this model, an attitude can be described as
   univalent (either positive or negative associations exist), explicitly
   ambivalent (both positive and negative associations exist and are
   endorsed), or implicitly ambivalent (one evaluative association is
   endorsed, and the opposite exists but is rejected).

   accessibility-diagnosticity model, elaborated as an anchoring and
   adjustment model by Lynch, Marmorstein, and Weigold. Cohen and Reed's
   concept of representational sufficiency embraces both attitude coherence
   and retrieval fluency; these map to prior operationalizations of
   diagnosticity in past accessibility-diagnosticity research. Cohen and
   Reed's functional sufficiency maps closely to Lynch et al.'s notion of a
   comparison of cumulative diagnosticity to a diagnosticity threshold in
   an anchoring and adjustment process. I identify differences between the

AB The brand extension literature suggests that consumers will favorably
   evaluate a brand extension when (a) it has high fit with the brand and
   (b) the brand has positive evaluations. We suggest that when a brand
   operates in multiple product domains, extension evaluations are more
   complex than have been conceptualized, and favorable consumer responses
   may result even in the absence of the above two conditions. Our
   two-process contingency model proposes two dimensions of fit (brand
   prototype fit and product exemplar fit) and two evaluative processes
   (top-down and parallel attitude transfer) that drive extension
   evaluations in different ways, depending on the level of cognitive
   resources. Three empirical studies found consistent support for the

PD JUN 2006

AB This research examines an empirical paradox documented by prior
   research: when choosing among assortments, consumers opt for the variety
   offered by larger assortments; however, consumers often are less
   confident in choices made from larger rather than from smaller
   assortments. By implying that consumers cannot always accurately predict
   their need for variety, this preference inconsistency also raises the
   question of what factors influence consumers' tendency to overestimate
   their need for the flexibility offered by larger assortments. Building
   on the view of choice as a hierarchical decision process, this research
   posits that choice among assortments is a function of consumers'
   decision focus and, in particular, the degree to which the subsequent
   task of making a choice from the selected assortment is salient to
   consumers. The data from four experiments offer converging evidence for
   the moderating role of decision focus on choice among assortments.

   (advertising) by demonstrating how objects and symbols derive meaning
   from their histories. We do this by examining a single visual trope
   common in advertising, white space. The choice of white space was
   purposeful in that it is not a picture and its history is both
   accessible and traceable. Our sociohistorical theory is supported by
   showing how specific movements and social forces acted upon the meaning
   of this particular visual rhetorical device and how this meaning is
   today shared and understood by both producers of ads (ad agency creative
   directors) and the readers of ads (ordinary consumers). We conclude with

AB We examined the consequences of regulatory focus on exposure to two
   types of comparative advertising frames-a maximal claim ("brand A is
   superior to brand B") and a minimal claim("brand A is equivalent or
   similar to brand B")-in three experiments. In experiment 1, we
   manipulated these frames, basing the sponsor brand's claim on comparison
   with an existing brand. In experiment 2, we operationalized the frames
   using a comparison featuring a sponsor brand targeting an established
   standard (Food and Drug Administration guidelines). A third experiment
   provided convergent evidence for the process underlying these effects.
   Consistent with theoretical reasoning, we found that promotion-focused
   individuals were more persuaded by maximal comparisons while
   prevention-focused individuals were either equally persuaded by the two
   frames or more persuaded by minimal frames. For prevention-focused
   individuals, maximal frames represented either a "no loss" or a
   "deviation from the norm." The no loss representation led to maximal and
   minimal frames being equally persuasive. The deviation from the norm
   representation led to greater negative elaboration on maximal frames,
   making them less persuasive than minimal frames. For promotion-focused
   people, a maximal frame simply represented a gain over a minimal frame,
   and hence it induced more favorable elaboration and greater persuasion.

   options vary in price? This research examines the influence of
   parity-pricing and differentiation-pricing strategies on consumer choice
   and identifies conditions in which parity pricing facilitates choice, as
   well as conditions in which choice is facilitated by differential
   pricing. In a series of three experiments, the impact of assortment
   pricing on choice is shown to be a function of the uncertainty
   associated with consumers' preferences and the consistency of these
   preferences with options' prices.

AB Prior research has found differences in satisfaction for choosers and
   nonchoosers of the same outcome. Two studies show that differentiability
   of the choice-set options moderates this effect. When options are more
   differentiated, choice enhances consumers' satisfaction with positive
   and dissatisfaction with negative outcomes; when options are less
   differentiated, choosers experience the same level of satisfaction as
   nonchoosers, regardless of the option valence. We test the hypothesis
   that the effect of outcome differentiability is due to differences in
   perceived responsibility and subsequent self-credit and self-blame for
   the decision outcome. A third study separates the effects of
   differentiability from random choice.

   estimate their need for price-elicitation precision? This research
   addresses these questions by applying the notion of compatibility to the
   relationship between consumers' bidding price uncertainty and the
   precision implied by the price-elicitation task. Data from four
   experiments show that when consumers are uncertain about the optimal
   bidding price, decision tasks requiring elicitation of precise bids lead
   to lower decision confidence, and vice versa. It is further shown that
   consumers display stronger preference for high-precision auctions, even

   the time the loss or the gain is experienced. We suggest that mere
   salience of the norms of a communal relationship (based on concern for
   the partner) relative to those of an exchange relationship (based on
   quid pro quo) leads to a greater degree of loss aversion. A typical
   endowment effect study supports our overall thesis and shows that
   differences across relationship norms are stronger in selling prices
   (willingness to accept) than in buying prices (willingness to pay).

AB This article contrasts narrative self-referencing with analytical
   self-referencing. propose that narrative self-referencing persuades
   through transportation, where people become absorbed in a story - in
   this case, in their storylike thoughts (Green and Brock 2000). When ad
   viewers are transported by these narrative thoughts, persuasion is not
   negatively affected by weak ad arguments. Conversely, analytical
   self-referencing persuades via more traditional processing models,
   wherein cognitive elaboration is enhanced by relating incoming
   information to one's self or personal experiences, which results in a
   differential persuasive effect of strong versus weak arguments. I also
   propose that ad skepticism moderates the effect of narrative
   transportation. My assertions are tested in two experiments in the
   context of mental simulation as a form of narrative self-referencing.

   Systems 1 and 2 are conceptualized as distinct modes of thought, the

   Cognitive load impedes system 2, yielding greater reliance on system 1.
   In memory-based choice, consumers must maintain relevant options in
   working memory. Thus, memory-based choices are associated with greater
   cognitive load than stimulus-based choices. Indeed, we find that
   memory-based choices favor immediately compelling, affect-rich system 1

   noteworthy is the finding that the amount of bias induced by a subtle,

   agreement with an agent on previously loved alternatives is perceived as
   more diagnostic of the agent's suitability than agreement on previously

   arises from greater ambiguity about attribute ratings of hated versus

   effect is moderated by the number of attributes, the number of

   slogan, whereas others access only a single, immediately available
   meaning. A novel measure of automatic access to secondary meaning (the
   Secondary Meaning Access via the Automatic Route Test, or SMAART) is
   developed to capture this individual difference and show its
   consequences for consumer responses to polysemous slogans with
   unfavorable secondary meanings. The automatic- access account is further
   validated by employing the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee,

   large number of studies fail to find this repetition effect. This
   article investigates the influence of the advertising context in which

   the ad content and individual differences in expertise, are found to
   influence the type of elaboration (item-specific and relational
   elaboration) a message receives. Message repetition affects evaluation
   when the additional exposures facilitate the complementary generation of
   these two types of elaboration of the ad message. When either type of
   elaboration dominates or when the message recipient spontaneously
   generates the impoverished type of elaboration, the effect of ad
   repetition is not observed. These findings provide evidence for the

AB We introduce and test a theory of how the choices consumers make are
   influenced by skill-based habits of use-goal-activated automated
   behaviors that develop through the repeated consumption or use of a
   particular product. Such habits can explain how consumers become locked
   in to an incumbent product. The proposed theory characterizes how the
   amount of experience with the incumbent product, the occurrence of usage
   errors while learning to use that product, and the goal that is
   activated at the time a choice is made interrelate to influence consumer
   preference. The results of three experiments support the theory's
   predictions.

AB Much research has explained regulatory focus effects via the alternative
   psychological states (eagerness vs. vigilance) people experience when
   they adopt different regulatory foci. This article identifies for the
   first time the cognitive mechanism that underlies regulatory focus
   effects. We propose that promotion-focus individuals engage in
   relational elaboration, which entails identifying commonalities or
   abstract relationships among disparate items. In contrast,
   prevention-focus individuals engage in item-specific elaboration, which
   involves focusing on specific attributes of each item independent of
   others. Results support our theorizing by demonstrating that
   promotion-focus (prevention-focus) individuals exhibit enhanced
   performance on tasks that require relational (item-specific)
   elaboration.

AB This article investigates two competing explanations of the mere

   theory (PF/M) and the affect-based hedonic fluency model (HFM)-under
   incidental exposure conditions. In two studies, the classical mere
   exposure effect is replicated in the context of banner advertising. The
   findings rule out the cognition-based PF/M and suggest that the
   spontaneous affective reaction resulting from perceptual fluency is a
   crucial link between fluency and evaluation. The studies provide strong
   evidence that the spontaneous affect influences evaluative judgments
   through a more complex process, likely by coloring the interpretation of
   the fluency experience and the nature of resulting metacognitions
   relating fluency to liking. Theoretical and managerial implications of
   the findings are mentioned.

AB Consumers infer their best product choice from comparative information
   about themselves and products (Prelec, Wernerfelt, and Zettelmeyer).
   Though common, this "matching" process leads to unstable preferences
   when perceived product ranks change due to product array manipulations.
   This article proposes that another variable, task difficulty, also leads
   to inconsistent choices through the matching process. Accuracy resulting
   from matching is also assessed by exploring domains where comparative
   standing is based on measurable, objective skill. The present studies
   show that people rely heavily on their relative self-assessments in
   product choice, but these estimates are often inaccurate and thus lead
   to unintended and inconsistent choices.

   Consistent with this identity-signaling perspective, four studies
   illustrate that consumers are more likely to diverge from majorities, or
   members of other social groups, in product domains that are seen as
   symbolic of identity ( e. g., music or hairstyles, rather than
   back-packs or stereos). In identity domains, participants avoided
   options preferred by majorities and abandoned preferences shared with
   majorities. The social group associated with a product influenced choice
   more in identity domains and when a given product was framed as identity
   relevant. People diverge, in part, to avoid communicating undesired

   conceptualizes the commercial marketplace as an ideological force that
   assimilates the symbols and practices of a counterculture into dominant
   norms. Our alternative argument is that co-optation can generate a
   countervailing market response that actively promotes the oppositional
   aspects of a counterculture attenuated by the process of commercial
   mainstreaming. To develop this theoretical argument, we analyze
   community-supported agriculture, which has emerged in response to the

   may attribute greater value and increased purchase likelihood to

   concepts that, in turn, affect how consumers process information. We
   theorized that when reasonably salient, a high versus low ceiling can
   prime the concepts of freedom versus confinement, respectively. These
   concepts, in turn, can prompt consumers' use of predominately relational
   versus item-specific processing. Three studies found support for this
   theorizing. On a variety of measures, ceiling height-induced relational
   or item-specific processing was indicated by people's reliance on
   integrated and abstract versus discrete and concrete ideation. Hence,
   this research sheds light on when and how ceiling height can affect

   contrary to normative predictions, perceptual focus can increase the

   feel simultaneous mixtures of both positive and negative emotions in

   leading to differences in subsequent choices. In addition we show that

AB When evaluating the net impact of a series of percentage changes, we
   predict that consumers may employ a "whole number" computational
   strategy that yields a systematic error in their calculation. We report
   on three studies conducted to examine this issue. In the first study we
   identify the computational error and demonstrate its consequences. In a
   second study, we identify several theoretically driven boundary
   conditions for the observed phenomenon. Finally we demonstrate in a
   real-world retail setting that, consistent with our premise, sequential
   percentage discounts generate more purchasers, sales, revenue, and
   profit than the economically equivalent single percentage discount.

AB Studies of response to advertising images follow parallel streams: one
   treats visuals as sensory data; the other, operating under rhetorical
   theory, presumes that images are communicative artifacts. By revisiting
   a seminal article by Mitchell and Olson, we empirically demonstrate an
   alternative explanation for results under the sensory approach, while
   also establishing the basis for complex statements like tropes. We argue
   that consumers read product attributes from pictures based on an
   emergent writing system made possible by recent communication
   technologies. Our theory is consistent with the historical record of
   communication technology and with the trajectory of research in fields
   that study writing systems.

   people in consistent ways (i.e., acting stereotypically). In this
   article, we present two experiments that show that the same primed
   construct can have different effects on the subsequent choices of
   different groups of people. These differences in effects are
   attributable to the groups having different prime associations. These

AB Loss aversion states that "losses loom larger than gains." We consider
   two types of loss aversion defined by two interpretations of loss. A
   loss can be defined (1) in terms of valence or (2) in terms of
   possession. Correspondingly, valence loss aversion (VLA) entails greater
   sensitivity to negative (vs. positive) changes, and possession loss
   aversion (PLA) entails greater sensitivity to items leaving (vs.
   entering) one's possession. Both types of loss aversion imply an
   endowment effect for attractive items, but PLA implies a reversal of the
   endowment effect for unattractive items. Experimental results show
   endowment effect reversals consistent with PLA.

AB Markman and Brendl have demonstrated that individuals tend to regard as
   more valuable those objects that are able to satisfy an active desire.
   Building on their framework, we predicted that desire would enlarge the
   consideration set and, hence, affect variety-seeking tendencies in a
   product category. Our first study shows that hunger and visual food cues
   enhance variety seeking in food items. Further, by means of mediation
   analyses and a suppression manipulation( exposing participants to stale
   foods), we are able to show that this increase in variety-seeking
   results from an increased attractiveness in the food items. Our second
   study, where we generalize these findings by applying them to
   nonphysiological goals, produces evidence that the effect-the increase
   in variety seeking-is domain specific.

AB Many consumer decisions are influenced by social interactions with other
   consumers. This research proposes that negative group information
   induces asymmetric effects on individual attitudes toward a product,
   depending on anticipated group interaction as a moderating variable.
   More specifically, negative group information is expected to induce more
   attitude change on consumers who hold positive attitudes. However, an
   opposite pattern of results is predicted when consumers anticipate
   discussing their product attitude with a group. Namely, negative group
   information should stimulate more attitude change on consumers who hold
   negative attitudes. In two experiments, we show reliable support for
   this interaction between individual attitude valence, group attitude
   valence, and anticipated group interaction. We also provide evidence in
   support of the theoretically predicted mechanism responsible for these
   effects. Implications for the emerging consumer literatures on valence
   asymmetry and anticipated group interaction are discussed.

   and cognitive perspectives on consumer phenomena. Developing insights by
   examining experiences of informants pursuing parenthood using assisted

   model of goal striving to explore how cultural discourses inform
   consumers' cognitions. We analyze how both life-project framing
   discourses and culturally pervasive discourses affect consumers and
   demonstrate that a cultural perspective is a vital complement to

   Consistent with this possibility, consumers in four experiments

   more, when large resource accounts of money, calories, or time (e. g.,
   the money in their savings account) were made temporarily accessible

   Furthermore, consumers' perception of the product as human mediates the

AB This study explicates the coconstitutive relationships between
   commercial mythmaking and popular memory that arise through myth market
   competitions for identity value. We develop a genealogical analysis of
   the representational strategies and ideological rationales that two
   prominent New South mythmakers use to shape popular memories in relation
   to their competitive goals and to efface counter-memories that
   contradict their mythologized representations. We then derive a
   conceptual model that highlights competitive, historical, and
   ideological influences on commercial mythmaking and their transformative
   effects on popular memory, which have not been addressed by prior
   theorizations of the meaning transfer process.

AB Three studies investigate the influence of empathy and the level of
   fictionality of short stories on consumers' evaluations of emotional
   melodramatic entertainment. We find that high empathizers' evaluations
   are more favorable when the story is low in fictionality (i.e., real)
   versus high. In contrast, low empathizers' evaluations do not differ,
   regardless of the level of fictionality, except when these individuals
   (i.e., males) are provided with an excuse to become involved in the
   story; in this case a story that is high (i.e., make-believe) as opposed
   to low in fictionality is evaluated more favorably. Finally,
   transportation (i.e., absorption into a narrative) with the story is
   found to both moderate and mediate the effects.

AB People usually like experiences less as they repeat them: they satiate.
   This research finds that people satiate less if they categorize the
   consumption episodes at lower levels. For instance, as people ate more
   jelly beans, their enjoyment declined less quickly when the candy was
   categorized specifically (e.g., cherry, orange) rather than generally
   (e.g., jelly bean). Three studies demonstrate this "specificity effect"
   for people's ratings of enjoyment both during and immediately after
   consumption. Process evidence shows that subcategorization focuses
   people's attention on differentiating aspects, making the episodes seem
   less repetitive and consequently less satiating.

AB In negative service environments, waiting time can serve to facilitate
   consumer coping. Consequently, the very wait management strategies (such
   as providing duration information or shortening the wait) that mitigate
   wait-based stress for nonnegative services may interfere with consumers'
   efforts to cope with an upcoming negative event. We show that the
   effectiveness of wait management strategies is moderated by event
   valence and, further, by the individual's coping orientation. Shortened
   wait times lead to increased stress for those using approach-oriented
   strategies(compared to avoidance), and duration information leads to
   increased stress for those using avoidance-oriented strategies.

AB What types of products are preferred when the purchase is immediate

   question by examining the influence of temporal perspective on
   evaluations of regulatory-framed products. The results reveal that when
   a purchase is about to be made, consumers prefer prevention- (vs.
   promotion-) framed products - an effect that is driven by the pain
   anticipated from potentially failing one's looming purchasing goal. When
   a purchase is temporally distant, however, promotion- (vs. prevention-)
   framed products become more appealing - an effect that is driven by the
   anticipated pleasure from achieving one's distant purchasing goal.
   Implications for the psychology of self-regulation, anticipated affect,

   People experience regulatory fit when their strategy of goal pursuit

   provide support for the hypothesis that regulatory fit improves whereas
   regulatory nonfit impairs self-regulatory performance. These results
   were obtained across multiple self-regulatory tasks that included a
   handgrip exercise to test physical endurance (experiment 1), a choice
   between a healthy and a decadent snack to test willpower in the face of
   temptation (experiments 2 and 3), and a health-related compliance
   decision to demonstrate self-regulation (experiment 4). Intensified

   attractiveness judgment that is compatible with attractive alternatives
   but incompatible with unattractive alternatives. We test this thesis by
   reversing the compatibility using a reject task that requires judgment
   of unattractiveness. Two studies find that compatibility between

   difficulty, attribute recall, and effort, underscoring the role of the

   differential processing as a function of pioneer and follower evaluation
   scenarios. We posit that consumers rely on singular evaluative
   processing in pioneer contexts and comparative evaluation in follower
   contexts, producing unique moderating effects based on the existence of
   comparison brands. Experimental results indicate that follower brands
   can actually benefit from comparison with pioneering brands that have a

   intentions to engage in health-protective behaviors (i.e., a boomerang
   effect). The boomerang arises from two psychological mechanisms: (1)
   drugs reduce risk perceptions and perceived importance of, and
   motivation to engage in, complementary health-protective behaviors, and
   (2) drugs are associated with poor health that reduces self-efficacy and
   perceived ability to engage in complementary health-protective
   behaviors. A combined intervention accompanying a drug remedy that
   targets both motivation and ability mitigates the drug boomerang on a
