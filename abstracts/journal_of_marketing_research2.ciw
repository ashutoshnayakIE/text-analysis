TI HOW BUYERS PERCEIVE SAVINGS IN A BUNDLE PRICE - AN EXAMINATION OF A
   BUNDLES TRANSACTION VALUE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although bundling, the selling of two or more products and/or services at a single price, has a history of economic research, marketing-oriented investigations have appeared only recently. This paper examines buyers' perceptions of overall savings when they evaluate a bundle offer. Such perceptions of overall bundle savings may consist of two separate perceptions of savings, each with a different relative influence: (1) perceived savings on the individual items if purchased separately and (2) perceived additional savings on the bundle. Results of an experiment indicate that additional savings offered directly on the bundle have a greater relative impact on buyers' perceptions of transaction value than savings offered on the bundle's individual items. The effect of each saving is also influenced by the magnitude of the other saving.

TI A 2-FACTOR EXPLANATION OF ASSIMILATION AND CONTRAST EFFECTS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Associations to a contextual cue were contrasted with those of an advertised object when the cognitive resources devoted to message processing were substantial and when the categories to which the contextual cue and the advertised object belonged displayed low overlap.  The absence of either of these factors prompted assimilation. A two-factor theory is offered to explain these outcomes.

TI INFERRING MARKET-STRUCTURE WITH AGGREGATE DATA - A LATENT SEGMENT LOGIT
   APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this paper, the authors introduce a ''latent segment logit'' (LSL) model that allows the identification of latent market segments when only macro-level time-series data (e.g., market share or sales, not individual choices) are available. The proposed model provides a paramorphic representation of market structure, based on the notion that ''structure'' implies heterogeneity in preferences and/or response to marketing mix elements. It assumes that independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) holds within latent segments (i.e., segments are homogeneous) but allows for heterogeneity across segments. Estimates for segment characteristics (including size, brand preferences, and sensitivity to marketing mix variables) are obtained by applying the model to aggregated longitudinal panel data. Validation tests are conducted on both the aggregated and disaggregated panel data. Aggregate validation demonstrates that the model is superior to standard market share models in terms of calibration and predictive fit. Disaggregated validation demonstrates that the latent segments recovered by the model account for much of the variation across household purchase histories, even though these data were not utilized in the estimation.

TI SEMIPARAMETRIC VERSUS PARAMETRIC CLASSIFICATION MODELS - AN APPLICATION
   TO DIRECT MARKETING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this paper we are concerned with estimation of a classification model using semiparametric and parametric methods. Benefits and limitations of semiparametric models in general, and of Manski's maximum score method in particular, are discussed. The maximum score method yields consistent estimates under very weak distributional assumptions. The maximum score method can very easily be used in situations where it is mare serious to make one kind of classification error than another. In this paper, we use a so-called threshold-crossing model to discriminate between credit card holders and nonholders. The estimated parameters of the logit model differ significantly from the estimates of maximum score. Given an loss function, maximum score performs better than the logit model.

TI MARKETINGS LIMITED ROLE IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN ONE
   COMPUTER-SYSTEMS FIRM
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The marketing literature has traditionally assumed that people in marketing and sales play a central role in product development activities. Though recent work has recognized that marketing may be less central in high-tech firms, there has been little empirical examination of the role marketing does play in these situations. This article, based on nine months of participant observation in a computer systems firm, first provides an overview of the product development process and then describes impediments that prevent marketing groups from exerting greater control over product development decisions. The author then turns to ways in which marketing groups work within these constraints, exerting their influence through informal networks, coalition building to champion specific projects in engineering, and going to the external market to ''complete the product'' for their respective market segments. He concludes by assessing the implications for research in high-tech firms and considering managerial implications.

TI INFLUENCING CONSUMER JUDGMENTS USING AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORIES - A
   SELF-REFERENCING PERSPECTIVE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate the affective nature of autobiographical memories and the conditions and mechanisms leading to transfer of this affect to ad and brand judgments. They find that when ads encourage the retrieval of autobiographical memories there is a higher level of felt affect and reduced processing of product attributes. Furthermore, this generally positive affect is readily transferred to the ad, thus enhancing ad evaluations. However, the extent of transfer of autobiographical affect to the brand depends on forging a link in the ad between the brand and the personal memory, as Study 1 demonstrates. Study 2 shows that when autobiographical memories are encouraged, brand evaluations are no different given strong versus weak product arguments, further evidence that brand evaluations are not based on an analysis of product claims when such memories are evoked. Study 2 also provides evidence for the dominance of affective inputs into brand judgments when both autobiographical affect and product arguments are relatively accessible from memory.

TI EQUITY ESTIMATION AND ASSESSING MARKET RESPONSE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Equity estimation has been proposed as a possibly superior technique for estimating market response functions in the presence of high predictor-variable collinearity. The relative performance of equity, ridge, and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators is examined using simulation experiments. In part, findings are consistent with prior research and indicate that, under certain conditions, equity outperforms OLS and ridge on a number of important criteria, and equity yields coefficient estimates that assign more equal explanatory weight to correlated predictor variables than does OLS or ridge. As collinearity increases, this tendency becomes very pronounced, to the point where equity yields estimated standardized coefficients more equal in magnitude irrespective of other conditions, such as true coefficient values and model explanatory power.

TI HOW CONSUMERS ALLOCATE THEIR TIME WHEN SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors assume consumers maximize value subject to a constraint on their time. The value of positive information is the increase in the expected utility of the consideration set; the value of negative information is the utility of choosing on the basis of the information versus the utility of a potentially erroneous decision without information. They examine four rules consumers use to select the order in which to visit sources. They use a multimedia computer laboratory, which allows consumers free choice among showroom visits, word-of-mouth interviews, magazine articles, and advertising for a new automobile. They estimate source value, compare predictions of time allocations to actual allocations, examine the impact of time constraints on the use of negative information, and calculate the relative performance of the source-order decision rules. They close with suggestions for experiments.

TI MARKOR - A MEASURE OF MARKET ORIENTATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In recent years, academic and practitioner interest has focused on market orientation and factors that engender this orientation in organizations. However, much less attention has been devoted to developing a valid measure of market orientation. Here we define market orientation as the organizationwide generation of market intelligence pertaining to current and future needs of customers, dissemination of intelligence horizontally and vertically within the organization, and organizationwide action or responsiveness to market intelligence. The authors describe a procedure to develop a measure of the construct. Key features of the research methodology include several rounds of pretesting, a single-informant assessment, and a multi-informant (both marketing and nonmarketing executives) replication and extension. The multi-informant results indicate that the proposed 20-item market orientation scale (MARKOR) may be best represented by a factor structure that consists of one general market orientation factor, one factor for intelligence generation, one factor for dissemination and responsiveness, one marketing informant factor, and one nonmarketing informant factor. Taking into account the informant factors, the subsequent validation tests are moderately supportive of the market orientation construct. The authors discuss methodological, substantive, and application directions for future research in light of these findings.

TI EXCESS BEHAVIORAL LOYALTY FOR HIGH-SHARE BRANDS - DEVIATIONS FROM THE
   DIRICHLET MODEL FOR REPEAT PURCHASING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Small market-share brands are known to suffer from two specific disadvantages compared with high-shore brands: they tend to have fewer buyers than high-share brands, and they also tend to be bought less often (Ehrenberg, Goodhardt, and Barwise 1990). The authors consider a third important advantage for high-share brands: unusually high behavioral loyalty (e.g., degree of repeat purchasing). We show, across many product-markets in both Japan and the U.S., that high-share brands have significantly greater loyalty than the levels that would be expected on the basis of a popular consumer purchase model (the Dirichlet model). Several possible causes for this effect are examined, including four key assumptions that underlie the Dirichlet model. The most likely source appears to be the existence of distinct consumer segments, which may emerge through the distribution strategies pursued by both large brands and small retailers. The authors discuss other possible causes of this market-share premium as well as several of its managerial implications.

TI A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH TO PRICING A BUNDLE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors propose a probabilistic approach to optimally price a bundle of products or services that maximizes seller's profits. Their focus is on situations in which consumer decision making is on the basis of multiple criteria. For model development and empirical investigation they consider a season ticket bundle for a series of entertainment performances such as sports games and music/dance concerts. In this case, they assume consumer purchase decisions to be a function of two independent resource dimensions, namely, available time to attend performances and reservation price per performance. Using this information, the model suggests the optimal prices of the bundle and/or components (individual performances), and corresponding maximum profits under three alternative strategies: (a) pure components (each performance is priced and offered separately), (b) pure bundling (the performances are priced and offered only as a bundle), and (c) mixed bundling (both the bundle and the individual performances are priced and offered separately). They apply their model to price a planned series of music/dance performances. Results indicate that a mixed bundling strategy is more profitable than pure components or pure bundling strategies provided the relative prices of the bundle and components are carefully chosen. Limitations and possible extensions of the model are discussed.

TI MARKETING IN TURBULENT ENVIRONMENTS - DECISION-PROCESSES AND THE
   TIME-SENSITIVITY OF INFORMATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors study the relationship among information processing, marketing decisions, and performance in turbulent markets-i.e., markets in which the time-sensitivity of information is a major factor in decision making. Drawing on both organizational contingency theory and individual behavioral decision research, the authors suggest that successful performance depends on the congruence between the level of marketplace turbulence and the information-processing style and associated decisions adopted. They focus by way of example on the decision processes embodied in formal planning procedures. Using the results from an experiment conducted with a strategic marketing simulation game, they show that ''planning'' leads both to an underweighting of the time-sensitivity of marketplace information and toward a bias in favor of certain marketing decisions over others-decisions that, in this case, result in inferior performance in turbulent markets when compared with that of decision makers not engaged in formal planning. They discuss the implications of the findings for managerial behavior in turbulent markets.

TI RELIABILITY-MEASURES FOR QUALITATIVE DATA - THEORY AND IMPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Data based on qualitative judgments are prevalent in both academic research in marketing and applied marketing research. Reliability measurement of qualitative data is important to determine the stability and quality of the data obtained. The authors assume a decision theoretic loss function, formally model the loss to the researcher of using wrong judgments, and show how this produces a new, proportional reduction in loss (PRL) reliability measure that generalizes many existing quantitative and qualitative measures. Because the PRL measure is often cumbersome to compute directly, they provide reference tables that enable the researcher to apply their approach easily. They then use this new approach to explore several important practical issues in conducting marketing research with qualitative judgments. In particular, they address the issues of (1) how reliable qualitative data should be (extending directly from Nunnally's rule of thumb for Cronbach's alpha in quantitative measurement), (2) how many judges are necessary given a known proportion of agreement between judges, and (3) given a fixed number of judges, what proportion of agreement must be obtained to ensure adequate reliability.

TI PERCEPTUAL MAPPING BASED ON IDIOSYNCRATIC SETS OF ATTRIBUTES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors describe a compositional perceptual mapping procedure, unrestricted attribute-elicitation mapping (UAM), which allows consumers to describe and rate the brands in their own terminology and thus relaxes the restrictive assumptions of traditional compositional mapping techniques regarding the structure and interpretation of the set of attributes. They compare the performance of three estimation techniques for constructing a group space based on the idiosyncratic data, namely, INDSCAL, CANCOR, and generalized procrustes analysis (GPA). Their findings indicate that the three estimation techniques perform about equally well. UAM also is compared with traditional compositional mapping. They find that UAM is superior on fit of the solution, interpretability, and sample reliability. UAM probably holds an edge with respect to data collection. Traditional compositional mapping is superior on ease of data analysis. No major difference was found on predictive validity and structural reliability.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine switching and repeat purchase effects of advertising in mature, frequently purchased product categories. They draw on consumer behavior theories of framing and usage dominance to formulate a logit choice model for measuring these effects. They estimate the model using single-source scanner data. Their results suggest that advertising induces brand switching but does not affect the repeat purchase rates of consumers who have just purchased the brand, a result consistent with usage dominance rather than framing. They find the switching influence to be largely confined between the current and previous purchase occasions. They illustrate the magnitude of this effect and explore potential profitability.

The methodology is based on an integrated least squares procedure that uses regression analysis in Stage 1 to estimate the coefficients of the controllable and environmental variables in combination with a Stage 2 discounted least squares smoothing procedure that updates key parameters in response to changing market conditions. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by applying it to weekly sales data from a major retail chain.

TI A TALE OF 2 CITIES - DISTINCTIVENESS THEORY AND ADVERTISING
   EFFECTIVENESS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors conducted an empirical study to test McGuire's (1984) distinctiveness theory within an advertising context. First, following the distinctiveness theory postulate, they found that members of minority groups were more likely than majority groups to have their ethnicity salient. Furthermore, in applying distinctiveness theory to persuasion, they found that members of minority (versus majority) groups find an ad spokesperson from their own ethnic group to be more trustworthy and that increased trustworthiness led to more positive attitudes toward the brand being advertised. The authors draw implications for both advertising to ethnic/minority groups as well as for further research applications of distinctiveness theory.

TI BENCHMARKS FOR DISCRETE-CHOICE MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In assessing the performance of a choice model, we have to answer the question, ''Compared with what?'' Analyses of consumer brand choice data historically have measured fit by comparing a model's performance with that of a naive model that assumes a household's choice probability on each occasion equals the aggregate market share of each brand. The authors suggest that this benchmark could form an overly naive point of reference in assessing the fit of a choice model calibrated on scanner-panel data, or any repeated-measures analysis of choice. They propose that fairer benchmarks for discrete choice models in marketing should incorporate heterogeneity in consumer choice probabilities, evidence for which is by now well documented in the marketing literature. They use simulated data to compare the performance of parametric and nonparametric benchmark models, which allow for heterogeneity in consumer choice probabilities, with the performance of the aggregate share-based benchmark model, which assumes consumers are homogeneous in their choice probabilities. They also assess the performance of two previously published consumer behavior models against the proposed fairer benchmark models that allow for heterogeneity in consumer choice probabilities. They find that one provides a significantly better fit than their more conservative benchmark models and the other performs less favorably.

TI THE EFFECT OF DEAL KNOWLEDGE ON CONSUMER PURCHASE BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Research has shown that there is heterogeneity in consumer knowledge of prices and deals. In addition, it has been found that buyers' purchase behavior can be influenced not only by the current price of a product, but also by what prices they expect in the future. The author builds a purchase quantity model to contrast normative behavior of consumers who have knowledge of future price deals with that of those who do not. Implications from the model are derived concerning consumer deal response for the consumer's preferred and less preferred brands. These implications show that normative purchase behavior is very different between consumers with and without knowledge of future deals. The model implies that consumers with knowledge of future deals could be more likely to purchase on low-value deals and deals on less preferred brands compared with consumers without knowledge of future deals. Another implication of interest is that the relative quantity purchased by consumers who have deal knowledge compared with those who do not depends on the time pattern of deals. The implications are supported in a laboratory experiment. The author finds that actual behavior varies depending on deal knowledge and is quite consistent with model predictions.

TI MODELING HIERARCHICAL CONJOINT PROCESSES WITH INTEGRATED CHOICE
   EXPERIMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors propose and illustrate an extension of the method of Hierarchical Information Integration (HII). HII allows one to handle large numbers of attributes in conjoint tasks by designing subexperiments that include subsets of attributes. It assumes that individuals can use general attributes or decision constructs to summarize their impressions of these subsets, which could be clusters of detailed, managerially relevant attributes. The proposed extension involves the design of subexperiments that include attributes plus summary evaluations of remaining constructs. Advantages are that subexperiments can be analyzed separately but also jointly to estimate one overall preference or choice model; a more flexible and easy task is obtained; and one can test the assumed hierarchical decision structure. The authors illustrate the approach with an application that models consumer choice of shopping center. In this application, results partially support the hierarchical structure and predictive validity. Finally, the authors discuss implications for further research.

TI SIGNAL-DETECTION-THEORY AND SINGLE OBSERVATION DESIGNS - METHODS AND
   INDEXES FOR ADVERTISING RECOGNITION TESTING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Most marketing applications of signal detection theory (SDT) produce an estimate of the respondent's memory accuracy based on exposure to a number of advertisements. Marketing practitioners, however, are usually more interested in the performance of an individual advertisement, or elements of that ad. Moreover, advertising recognition paradigms are typically limited to single observations per respondent. The authors present and compare two alternative methodologies that estimate SDT parameters for such designs by pooling recognition performance across respondents. They present two simulations that explore the most efficient methodology and suggest guidelines for selecting appropriate accuracy indices.

Using this approach it is possible to describe how membership in each of the segments, segments being characterized by a specific profile of brand preferences and marketing variable sensitivities, is related to household demographic characteristics. An empirical application of the methodology is provided using A.C. Nielsen scanner panel data on catsup. The authors provide a comparison with the results obtained using the extant methodology in estimation and validation samples of households.

TI MASTERING THE MIX - DO ADVERTISING, PROMOTION, AND SALES FORCE
   ACTIVITIES LEAD TO DIFFERENTIATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors consider the effects of three marketing communication activities on nonproduct based differentiation. Specifically, they examine whether advertising, sales force, and promotion activities increase a firm's ability to differentiate and thus shield itself from future price competition. They suggest that own-price elasticity represents a measure of differentiation and examine the effects of marketing communication activities on own-price elasticities for a large number of consumer (durable.and nondurable) businesses. They make a series of predictions about future differentiation outcomes based on the likely uniqueness of the communication message. The obtained results are compatible with their basic premise that, by providing unique and positive messages, a firm can insulate itself from future price competition, as witnessed by less negative future price elasticities. Conversely, results indicate that nonunique messages can decrease future differentiation, for example, price promotions for firms that price above the industry average lead to more negative future price elasticities.

TI BRANDS, BRAND MANAGEMENT, AND THE BRAND MANAGER SYSTEM - A

AB The authors examine the history of brand management by tracing its development in the context of the marketing environment from 1870 to the present. They develop six theses regarding the evolution of brand management and its implications and substantiate them utilizing a historical approach. They demonstrate that the brand manager system originated well after the leadership of branded products was established, it was adopted following a conventional adoption curve pattern, and it has proven quite adaptable to differing firm and marketing environments over the past several decades. They then evaluate its likely fate in today's rapidly changing environment.

TI THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTENT OF PERCEIVED QUALITY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate whether movement in a firm's stock price, that is, a measure of firm value, is associated with information contained in perceived quality measures. In a model that also allows for the effect of economywide factors and a firm's return on investment, they find a positive relationship between stock return and changes in quality perceptions. These results imply that the quality measure contains information, incremental to that reflected by current-term accounting measures, about future-term business performance. They suggest that managers should convey information to the stock market, such as the brand's quality image, useful in depicting the long-term prospects of the business. By doing so, the stock market will rely less on short-term measures of business performance, and managers will be freer to undertake strategies necessary for ensuring the long-term viability of their firms.

The author provides an extremely general product line pricing model that calibrates the potential profit benefits of a coordinated category-level pricing strategy as compared with an uncoordinated brand-level pricing strategy. The model can be used to obtain optimal prices and profits for any general pricing ''coalition'' between brands-brand management or category management.

TI THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BRAND IN BRAND EXTENSION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Recent research has identified two factors that influence consumer perceptions of a brand extension: brand affect and the similarity between the original and extension product categories. However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to other associations specific to the brand itself. The authors perform three experiments to explore the relative importance of these associations. The experiments reveal that brand-specific associations may dominate the effects of brand affect and category similarity, particularly when consumer knowledge of the brands is high. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for managerial decision making and the process by which consumers evaluate brand extensions.

TI THE EFFECT OF BRAND PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS ON CONSUMER EVALUATIONS OF
   BRAND EXTENSIONS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB A growing number of brands are becoming associated with a portfolio of different product categories. Although concerns have been raised that adding products to a brand may weaken it, there is a paucity of research exploring the effects of brand portfolio characteristics on brand strength. Using two laboratory experiments and a survey, the authors examine the effects of several brand portfolio characteristics on consumers' confidence in and favorability of their evaluations of subsequent brand extensions. The experiment-based findings reveal a positive relationship between the number of products affiliated with a brand and consumers' confidence in and favorability of their evaluations of extension quality. These results were not replicated in the survey. However, in both methods, the authors found that as portfolio quality variance decreases, a positive relationship between number of products affiliated with a brand and consumers' confidence in their extension evaluations emerges. Implications of these and other findings for both the theory and practice of brand management are discussed.

TI TO EXTEND OR NOT TO EXTEND - SUCCESS DETERMINANTS OF LINE EXTENSIONS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors study the determinants of line extension success using data on 75 line extensions of 34 cigarette brands over a 20-year period to investigate the relative effects of brand, extension, and firm characteristics on the incremental market share of brand line extensions. The econometric model also captures the extent of cannibalization of parent brand sales that may have occurred due to the line extension's introduction. The authors also explore the role of a brand's symbolic value as a factor in line extension success. Results indicate that parent brand strength and its symbolic value, early entry timing, a firm's size, and distinctive marketing competencies, as well as the advertising support allocated to line extensions, contribute positively to the success of line extensions. Their findings suggest that, in this industry, cannibalization effects of line extension activity may have been limited and line extensions into earlier subcategories actually may have helped the parent brand. Even with cannibalization, the incremental sales generated by the extension seem to be reason enough to make a line extension strategy viable.

TI FOREIGN BRANDING AND ITS EFFECTS ON PRODUCT PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB With three experiments, the authors examine the notion that foreign branding-the strategy of pronouncing or spelling a brand name in a foreign language-triggers cultural stereotypes and influences product perceptions and attitudes. Choosing French brands as one specific case, Experiment 1 shows that the French pronunciation of a brand name affects the perceived hedonism of the products, attitudes toward the brand, and attitudes toward the brand name. Experiment 2 shows that congruent country-of-origin information, added to French branding, does not result in more hedonic perceptions; incongruence, however, diminishes the effect. In Experiment 3, an actual product taste test is performed. Despite the presence of direct sensory experience, consumer perceptions of a product change as a result of French branding.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop a new survey-based method for measuring and understanding a brand's equity in a product category and evaluating the equity of the brand's extension into a different but related product category. It uses a customer-based definition of brand equity as the added value endowed by the brand to the product as perceived by a consumer. It measures brand equity as the difference between an individual consumer's overall brand preference and his or her brand preference on the basis of objectively measured product attribute levels. To understand the sources of brand equity, the approach divides brand equity into attribute-based and nonattribute-based components. The method provides the market share premium and the price premium attributable to brand equity. The survey-based results from applying the method to the toothpaste and mouthwash categories show that the proposed approach has good reliability, convergent validity, and predictive validity.

TI UNDERSTANDING BRAND COMPETITION USING MICRO AND MACRO SCANNER DATA
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Recent advances in data gathering through checkout scanners have produced vast amounts of data on the actual behavior of consumers in the market-place, creating new opportunities for managers and researchers to understand competition and consumers' response to the marketing mix. Previous analyses of this data in the literature have focused either at the household (micro) or store (macro) level. The authors propose a method of enriching the analysis of competitive behavior by combining the in-depth consumer information obtained from a micro-level household scanner panel with the comprehensive market data supplied by a macro-level retail-tracking panel. The approach offers the manager detailed information about consumers (e.g., identification of consumer segments in terms of brand preferences and socioeconomic characteristics) along with strategic diagnostics of the product-market (e.g., the sensitivity of the market to price promotions, impact of a brand's strategy on competitors, vulnerability of the brand to competitive actions).

The methodology presented is a restricted version of a mixture-of-logits model and obtains brand positions on a product-market map and the distribution of preferences across households while accounting for the effects of marketing variables on household brand choice behavior. The restriction involves imposing a factor structure on the covariance matrix of the distribution of intrinsic brand preferences. An empirical application of the methodology is presented using A.C. Nielsen household-level scanner panel data on the purchases of liquid laundry detergents. The results indicate that the proposed model provides a better fit to the data than the unrestricted mixture-of-logits model or the Choice Map methodology.

TI RENTALS, SALES, AND BUYBACKS - MANAGING SECONDARY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors analyze a problem facing a durable product manufacturer who has to manage two ''noncompeting'' channel systems. In particular, they focus on the practices of U.S. automakers who distribute new cars through both dealers and rental agencies. In their stylized model, the dealer sells cars to customers and the renter satisfies customers' short-term needs by renting cars. As a result, in the short run, the rental market does not compete with the dealer's market. However, if the renter eventually sells some of its used cars into the consumer market,then these sales can compete with the dealer's sales of new cars. Using a two-period model, the authors analyze three channel structures that exist in today's auto market. They discuss the implications of their work on the structure of distribution channels in the automobile industry and show how dealer profits and total manufacturer sales depend on the type of channel structure used.

TI MEANINGFUL BRANDS FROM MEANINGLESS DIFFERENTIATION - THE DEPENDENCE ON
   IRRELEVANT ATTRIBUTES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Conventional product differentiation strategies prescribe distinguishing a product or brand from competitors' on the basis of an attribute that is relevant, meaningful, and valuable to consumers. However, brands also successfully differentiate on an attribute that appears to create a meaningful product difference but on closer examination is irrelevant to creating that benefit-''meaningless'' differentiation. The authors examine how meaningless differentiation can produce a meaningfully differentiated brand. They argue that buyers may infer that a distinguishing but irrelevant attribute is in fact relevant and valuable under certain conditions, creating a meaningfully differentiated brand. They outline the consumer inference process and develop a set of hypotheses about when it will produce meaningful brands from meaningless differentiation. Experimental tests in three product categories support their analysis. They explore the implications of the results for product differentiation strategies, consumer preference formation, and the nature of competition.

TI ORGANIZATIONAL CITIZENSHIP BEHAVIORS AND SALES UNIT EFFECTIVENESS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are defined as discretionary, extra-role behaviors on the part of a salesperson that have been shown to influence managers' evaluations of performance. It has been suggested that one reason managers value OCBs is that they believe OCBs contribute to organizational success. The authors' purpose is to investigate the impact of OCBs on objective unit performance and compare this effect with the impact that OCBs have on managerial evaluations. First, the impact of OCBs on overall performance evaluations is examined. Second, the aggregate effects of unit-level OCBs on agency performance are examined using objective performance data for 116 agencies in a major insurance company. The results show that OCBs make an important contribution to overall agency performance; however, some citizenship behaviors appear to help and others hinder agency performance. Finally, a comparison of the results of the two studies suggests that managers tend to over-value some citizenship behaviors and undervalue others.

AB The authors examine how new brand entries affect consumers' consideration sets. A within-subject longitudinal experiment examines several entry positions into existing markets. The results suggest that new brand entries produce changes in consideration sets toward dominating, compromise, and assimilated brands, away from extreme brands in two-brand markets, and toward dominating and away from extreme brands in eight-brand markets. These results are confirmed by a second experiment that utilizes a between-subject design and markets with six existing brands.

TI ENHANCING MEMORY OF TELEVISION COMMERCIALS THROUGH MESSAGE SPACING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Though advertising repetition is a frequently used marketing strategy, its effects are not well understood. The authors report findings from a laboratory experiment in which they investigated the effects of repeating a television commercial as a function of varying the message spacing or lag (i.e., the number of intervening commercials between two presentations of the target commercial) and the delay in memory measurement. In two different samples-younger and older adults-the results show a lag by measurement delay interaction. In general, results show that in the long measurement delay condition, the recall of message contents was significantly higher with the long lag than with the short lag. However, in the short measurement delay condition, recall was significantly higher with the short lag than with the long lag. The results are explained by a variation of encoding variability theory. The implications of the findings for media planning and television advertising to older adults are discussed.

TI BUYING OR JUST BROWSING - THE DURATION OF PURCHASE DELIBERATION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Newman and Staelin (1971) point to a lack of research addressing the important questions of ''How long are buyers' in process' on their purchasing decisions?'' and ''What factors are related to differences in decision time?'' Unfortunately, very little attention has been paid to this important research area during the more than two decades following Newman and Staelin's work. Accordingly, the authors develop a theory of the evolution of choice decisions for consumer durable products. This theory addresses information acquisition behavior and the duration of the purchase deliberation process itself. From this general theory, hypotheses pertaining to the duration of the deliberation process are tested using new car purchase survey data.

TI REDUCING COMPETITIVE AD INTERFERENCE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Some recent research has shown that the presence of competitive advertising undermines the recall of a marketer's advertising. The authors use the encoding variability hypothesis to develop two approaches to counter the detrimental effects of competitive advertising. In the first experiment, the use of varying ad executions is shown to help resist competitive advertising better than repeating the same executions. In the second experiment, changing the modality of target advertising to be different from the modality of competitive advertising is shown to reduce interference effects.

   AESTHETIC TASTES FOR CULTURAL PRODUCTS

AB New data pertaining to tastes for popular culture support and extend the previous finding that consumers tend to form enduring preferences during a sensitive period in their lives. A psychographic measure of the consumer's attitude toward the past is shown to moderate this tendency, and differences between male and female respondents suggest that the experience of strong positive feelings plays a causal role. These findings can guide the marketer in designing aesthetic aspects of products or promotional stimuli and may increase the practicality of using cohort analysis for predictions of consumer demand.

TI DO COUPON EXPIRATION DATES AFFECT CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Expiration dates are used by couponers to limit their financial liability temporally. Traditional wisdom assumes that coupon redemptions are greatest in the period immediately following the coupon drop and decline monotonically. Using regret theory, the authors predict that expiration dates induce a second mode in the redemption pattern just prior to the expiration date. They test this prediction by extending an existing coupon redemption model to incorporate an expiration effect and then estimating both the existing and the expiration models using weekly coupon redemption data for spaghetti sauce from A.C. Nielsen panels in two cities. Results are consistent with their prediction. Implications for practitioners and researchers are discussed.

TI FINDING CHOICE ALTERNATIVES IN MEMORY - PROBABILITY-MODELS OF BRAND-NAME
   RECALL
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Recalling brand names is an important aspect of consumer choice in many situations.  The authors develop a general Markov model that relates probabilistic aspects of recall to consumer and marketing mix variables.  Then they illustrate how parameters can be estimated from recall data for three special cases of the model:  The first is a ''baseline'' version of the model that can be used to assess the extent to which categories of brands can be automatically included in or excluded from memory search; the second is a zero-order model that can be used to estimate the effects of brand variables and individual usage rates on recall latency; and the third is a first-order model that uses aggregate recall data to assess market structure.  Finally, the authors demonstrate how the model can be used in numerical analyses to evaluate awareness-building strategies.

They first discuss the goals and four essential characteristics of ethnographic interpretation. Then they review the particular contributions to interpretation of several kinds of ethnographic observation and interview data. Next they discuss how interpretations are built from ethnographic data. They show how multilayered interpretations of market phenomena emerge through systematic analysis of complementary and discrepant data. Finally, the authors articulate three representational strategies that are used to link multilayered interpretations to marketing strategy formulation. They suggest that ethnographic methods are appropriate for apprehending a wide variety of consumption and use situations with implications for market segmentation and targeting; product and service positioning; and product, service, and brand management.

TI ADVERTISINGS IMPACT ON CATEGORY SUBSTITUTION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The usage frequency of a mature brand can be increased by encouraging consumers to substitute it in situations for which it is not normally used. They are most likely to do so if they perceive the target brand as neither too similar to nor dissimilar from the product it is replacing. In study 1, the author shows that ads are most likely to change usage attitudes by either (1) advertising common attributes when the comparison product is dissimilar or (2) advertising distinct attributes when the comparison product is similar. In study 2, replicating the design of study 1, the author demonstrates that ads that have a positive impact on usage attitudes toward the target brand can have a corresponding negative impact on usage attitudes toward the comparison product. Hence, the effectiveness of an expansion advertising campaign depends on its positive impact on the target brand and its negative impact on the comparison product.

   SIMULATED CHANNEL SETTING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors employ a simulated market channel to investigate two properties of interdependence-magnitude and relative asymmetry.  Increasing magnitudes of joint dependence are associated with more frequent use of noncoercive strategies, less frequent use of coercive strategies, lower residual conflict, and more favorable evaluations of partner performance.  These results support the relational exchange paradigm.  Findings for relative asymmetry were not anticipated but are informative.  First, an increasing power advantage did not result in the predicted greater use of threats and punishments, although demands and normative statements were more prevalent.  Second, one side of the dyad decreased its use of rewards and the other increased its use of rewards, promises, and information persuasion.  As predicted, an increasing power advantage (lower relative dependence) is associated with less favorable performance evaluations of exchange partners and less residual conflict.

The model posits that demographics are poor predictors of coupon-use behavior, because they are the farthest in the causal chain. The effects of demographics are mediated by three layers of mediating variables, each successively closer to coupon attitudes and use. Data from a sample of grocery shoppers show most of the hypothesized mediational paths to be significant. The research cautions against arbitrary use of demographics for targeting promotional efforts and offers an approach to constructing an understanding of the psychological processes that mediate between consumers' demographics and their marketplace behaviors.

AB Marketing boundary spanners-especially customer service representatives-are notably susceptible to burnout. The authors define the burnout construct and develop hypotheses to examine if burnout acts as a partial mediator between role stressors and key behavioral and psychological job outcomes. Responses from 377 customer service representatives reveal that burnout levels are high relative to other burnout-prone occupations (e.g., police, nursing) and that burnout has consistent, significant, and dysfunctional effects on their behavioral and psychological outcomes. Moreover, burnout mediates the negative effects of role stressors on job outcomes, whereas the positive effects of role stressors are unmediated.

TI A FACTOR-ANALYTIC PROBIT MODEL FOR REPRESENTING THE MARKET-STRUCTURE IN
   PANEL-DATA
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Internal market structure analysis infers both brand attributes and consumer preferences for those attributes from preference or choice data.  The authors exploit a new method for estimating probit models from panel data to infer market structures that can be displayed in few dimensions, even though the model can represent every possible vector of purchase probabilities.  The result outperforms each of several other models, including Choice Map, SCULPTRE, and Chintagunta's latent class model in terms of goodness of fit, predictive validity, and face validity for a detergent data set.  Because theirs is the only market structure model to outperform the structureless Dirichlet-multinomial stochastic brand choice model, the other methods cannot claim to have recovered market structure for these data.

TI DETERMINANTS OF STORE-LEVEL PRICE ELASTICITY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Using weekly scanner data representing 18 product categories, the authors estimated store-specific price elasticities for a chain of 83 supermarkets.  They related these price sensitivities to a comprehensive set of demographic and competitor variables that described the trading areas of each of the stores.  Despite the inability of previous research to find much of a relationship between consumer characteristics and price sensitivity, 11 demographic and competitive variables explain on average 67% of the variation in price response.  Moreover, the authors found that the consumer demographic variables are much more influential than competitive variables.  Their findings open the possibility for more effective everyday and promotional pricing strategies that exploit store-level differences in price sensitivity.

TI DETERMINANTS OF COMPETITORS RESPONSE-TIME TO A NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB This research studies a neglected dimension of competitive defensive strategy-the speed of a competitor's reaction to the introduction of a new product.  Building on the literature in organizational and strategic management, the authors investigate how the strategic pressures facing a firm and its organizational characteristics influence the speed with which it is willing and able to respond.  A model that considers the ordered nature of the dependent measure is specified and estimated using PIMS data on industrial and consumer product manufacturers.  Market growth, the market share of the reacting firm, the typical new product development time and the frequency of product changes in the industry, and the market share of the threatening firm appear to be significant determinants of reaction time.

TI THE EFFECTS OF SUPPLIER FAIRNESS ON VULNERABLE RESELLERS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB This study examines the role of supplier fairness in developing long-term relationships between relatively smaller, vulnerable resellers and larger, powerful suppliers.  The authors conceptualize two components of fairness-distributive fairness, that is, the fairness of outcomes received by the reseller from carrying the supplier's line, and procedural fairness, the fairness of procedures and processes used by the supplier in relation to its resellers.  Testing their hypotheses from the perspective of automobile dealers, the authors find strong evidence that vulnerable resellers' perceptions of both distributive and procedural fairness enhance their relationship quality, although these effects are moderated by the level of outcomes and environmental uncertainty.  Furthermore, procedural fairness has relatively stronger effects on relationship quality than distributive fairness, which is a somewhat surprising result from a managerial perspective.  The constructs and relationships among the constructs demonstrate cross-national stability across the two countries in the sample, the United States and the Netherlands.

TI A BRANDS EYE VIEW OF RESPONSE SEGMENTATION IN CONSUMER BRAND CHOICE
   BEHAVIOR
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop an approach to reveal segmentation in response to marketing variables at a brand-level perspective.  In the proposed procedure, response segmentation is analyzed separately for each brand instead of jointly across all brands.  This yields a segmentation picture oriented toward the potential targeting objectives of the brand manager.  Using the multinomial logit and probabilistic mixture models, the procedure first calibrates consumer response in the brand choice decision.  Individual-level measures of response for a given marketing variable (e.g., price) are then computed, and brand-level segments are obtained by clustering brand-specific response.  Using scanner panel data, the approach is applied to price response segmentation for brands that compete in the ground coffee category.  The results illustrate a series of implications for brand strategy, particularly the potential for targeting marketing activity to different response segments.

TI HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR PARTNER - STRATEGIES FOR FORMULATING
   PROXY-REPORTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON CONVERGENCE TO SELF-REPORTS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Surveys in marketing often ask one member of a household what other members think of a new product idea or what their preferences are in terms of existing products and brands.  The authors investigate the strategies proxy-reporters use to answer such questions and how close they come to what the target respondents themselves answer.  They find that as the extent to which a couple talks to each other or participates in an activity together increases, proxy-reporters tend to use more specific information about the target respondent, and the convergence between self- and proxy-reports tends to increase.  Furthermore, as the extent of participation/discussion increases, the strategies used to arrive at self-and proxy-reports become more similar.  Implications for improving the quality and cost-effectiveness of survey research are discussed.

TI COSTS AND BENEFITS OF HARD-SELL
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Marketers are accused of selling people products they do not need.  This can frustrate consumers and eventually lead to angry social commentators.  The authors define hard-sell as an effort to match customers to goods that is so annoying to the average consumer that the displeasure exceeds its potential benefits.  Using this definition, they derive three results:  Hard-sell (1) prevails in the market because it mitigates price competition, (2) injures all consumers, including the often-overlooked customers who avoid direct encounters with the practice, and yet it (3) may increase social welfare because sellers gain more than consumers lose.

TI CAPTURING GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCALIZED MISSPECIFICATION ERROR IN RETAIL
   STORE CHOICE MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB No retail store choice model, no matter how many relevant variables it might include, can realistically expect to model all the variation in store choice.  There are always some variables that are left out, because they are difficult to measure, they have not yet been conceptualized in theory, or their estimated parameter stability suffers when an excessive number of predictors are included.  Because these omitted variables can be correlated with geographic location, model misspecification error may itself be correlated with location.  Estimating the geographically localized misspecification errors therefore suggests itself as a method for estimating (and predicting) the effects of these omitted variables.  The authors show that spatial nonstationarity of the model parameters may also be expressed as an instance of omitted variables and therefore be addressed using their method.  They show, using both a simulation study and an empirical natural experiment, that estimating the geographically localized misspecification error can appreciably reduce prediction error, even when the predictor model is reasonably well specified.

TI HOW TV-ADVERTISING WORKS - A METAANALYSIS OF 389 REAL-WORLD SPLIT CABLE
   TV-ADVERTISING EXPERIMENTS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors analyze results of 389 BEHAVIORSCAN(R) matched household, consumer panel, split cable, real world T.V. advertising weight, and copy tests, Additionally, study sponsors-packaged goods advertisers, T.V. networks, and advertising agencies-filled out questionnaires on 140 of the tests, which could test common beliefs about how T.V. advertising works, to evaluate strategic, media, and copy variables unavailable from the BEHAVIORSCAN(R) results. Although some of the variables did indeed identify T.V. advertising that positively affected Sales, many of the variables did not differentiate among the sales effects of different advertising treatments. For example, increasing advertising budgets in relation to competitors does not increase sales in general. However, changing brand, copy, and media strategy in categories with many purchase occasions in which in-store merchandising is low increases the likelihood of T.V. advertising positively affecting sales. The authors' data do not show a strong relationship between standard recall and persuasion copy test measures and sales effectiveness. The data also suggest different variable formulations for choice and market response models that include advertising.

TI INCORPORATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE INTO THE ANALYSIS OF CONJOINT STUDIES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors use conjoint analysis to provide interval-level estimates of part-worths allowing tradeoffs among attribute levels to be examined. Researchers often possess prior information about the part-worths, such as the order and range restrictions of product attribute levels. It is known, for example, that consumers would rather pay less for a specific product given that all other product attribute levels are unchanged. The authors present a Bayesian approach to incorporate prior ordinal information about these part-worths into the analysis of conjoint studies. Their method results in parameter estimates with greater face validity and predictive performance than estimates that do not utilize prior information or those that use traditional methods such as LINMAP. Unlike existing methods, the authors' methods apply to both rating and choice-based conjoint studies.

AB Developing and managing brand image is an important part of a firm's marketing program. However, little research has been done (1) on linking the use of brand image strategies to product performance or (2) on managing brand images in global markets. The author examines the brand image-performance linkage for consumer goods in two categories marketed internationally. He also develops a conceptual framework that identifies various cultural and socioeconomic environmental characteristics of foreign markets that are hypothesized to affect brand image performance. Results from a 10 country/60 region study indicate that cultural power distance, cultural individualism, and regional socioeconomics affect the performance of functional (problem prevention and solving), social (group membership and symbolic), and sensory (novelty, variety, and sensory gratification) brand image strategies. The author then discusses the implications for managers marketing brands internationally and the directions for further research.

TI PREDICTING BEHAVIOR FROM INTENTION-TO-BUY MEASURES - THE PARAMETRIC CASE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author develops a probabilistic model that converts stated purchase intents into purchase probabilities. The model allows heterogeneity between nonintenders and intenders with respect to their probability to switch to a new ''true'' purchase intent after the survey, thereby capturing the typical discrepancy between overall mean purchase intent and subsequent proportion of buyers (bias). When the probability to switch of intenders is larger (smaller) than that of nonintenders, the overall mean purchase intent overestimates (underestimates) the proportion of buyers. As special cases, the author derives upper and lower bounds on proportions of buyers from purchase intents data and shows the consistency of those bounds with observed behavior, except in predictable cases such as new products and business markets. However, a straightforward modification of the model deals with new product purchase forecasts.

They conduct two experiments on varying health-related issues: sexually transmitted disease and skin cancer. In both studies, the authors demonstrate that a low efficacy condition (i.e., when it is uncertain that following the recommendations will lead to the desired outcome) motivates more in-depth processing. They then show that when subjects process in-depth, negative frames are more persuasive than positive ones. In contrast, a high efficacy condition generates less effortful message processing in which positive and negative frames are equally persuasive.

They find support for the hypothesis that royalty rate balances the incentives to the franchisor to invest in brand name with those to the franchisees to invest in retail service, Also consistent with the mixed strategy equilibrium, the authors find that royalty rate positively affects monitoring frequency, and that monitoring costs negatively affect service level. However, contrary to the theory, the authors find that monitoring costs inversely affect monitoring frequency among franchisors. They analytically extend Lal's model to incorporate heterogeneity in monitoring costs among franchisees belonging to the same franchisor and find strong empirical support for the hypothesis that monitoring costs inversely affect monitoring frequency within a franchise system.

These explanatory variables could characterize different product, situation, or person related conditions that either occur naturally or are experimentally manipulated. Their proposed methodology simultaneously estimates market segment membership and multivariate segment-level parameters for each dependent criterion, using finite mixtures of conditional Dirichlet distributions. They conduct a modest Monte Carlo simulation analysis to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH

The primary insight of the author's empirical analysis is that General Mills places a higher future value on achieved sales than do the other competitors in the market.

TI MAKING THE CUT - MODELING AND ANALYZING CHOICE SET RESTRICTION IN
   SCANNER PANEL-DATA
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop an approach to determine and analyze choice set restriction on the basis of secondary source information on consumer purchase histories. Individual-level choice sets are estimated using a Bayesian updating procedure in conjunction with the multinomial legit model, The authors apply the procedure to scanner panel data for the liquid laundry detergent category. An analysis of estimated choice sets across panelists reveals that market share does not ''go hand-in-hand'' with choice set share (the percentage of choice sets in which a brand is a member), Examining choice set membership patterns, such as the cooccurrence of brands in the same product line, also provides insight into sister-brand cannibalization. Estimation results also show that promotions can expand choice sets, providing excluded brands a means to gain entry and long-term sales benefits.

TI CONSUMER INVOLVEMENT AND DECEPTION FROM IMPLIED ADVERTISING CLAIMS

AB Results from Experiment 1 reveal that consumers highly involved in processing an advertisement are likely to make invalid inferences from incomplete-comparison claims al the time of processing and, hence, be deceived, Less involved consumers may be induced to complete such claims at the time of measurement, which makes it appear that they also were deceived by the advertisement, Experiment 2 then demonstrates that deception depends on the processing demands of the advertising claim. Only less involved consumers are deceived by inconspicuous-qualification claims, which require detailed processing of the advertisement for non-deception, The author discusses the implications of these findings for advertisers and public policy.

They test the model using data from two computer-controlled shopping experiments. In both studies, quadratic and gamma specifications for the effect of advertising claim discrepancy on expectation change fit better than a Furthermore, the adaptive expectations framework linear model. Furthermore, the adaptive expectations framework describes the updating of consumer expectations when the consumer observes the quality of the new product. In this setting, the observed quality is more influential than the advertised quality in changing expectations, and ''good news'' is discounted, whereas ''bad news'' is more readily accepted.

Evidence in support of this market outcome comes from optometry, a service that has experienced advertising deregulation over the past two decades, The author discusses various explanations of this outcome, including the possibility that self-deceiving consumers relying on ''illusory qualities'' believe they can judge product quality as measured by the firm, though they cannot, Thus, those consumers are ultimately satisfied with low-quality products at high prices-''sweet lemons.''

TI LIFE-STYLE SEGMENTATION WITH TAILORED INTERVIEWING
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors present a tailored interviewing procedure for life-style segmentation. The procedure assumes that a life-style measurement instrument has been designed. A classification of a sample of consumers into life-style segments is obtained using a latent-class model. With these segments, the tailored interview procedure classifies consumers into the same segments in future studies. The procedure minimizes the error of misclassification and decreases the interview costs by using only a fraction of the items for each respondent. In an empirical application to a questionnaire designed to assess lifestyle related to the consumption of fashion, the authors obtain a classification that agrees. with the full interview (i.e., using all scale items) for 73% of the respondents while using only 22% of all the questions in a traditional life-style battery.

TI ORGANIZATIONAL MARKET-INFORMATION PROCESSES - CULTURAL ANTECEDENTS AND
   NEW PRODUCT OUTCOMES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Organizational research suggests that the way information is used is likely to be a function of the presence of organizational systems or processes, in addition to individual manager activities, The author suggests that firms vary their emphasis on certain organizational market information processes, such as information acquisition, information transmission, conceptual use of information, and instrumental use of information. The author argues that the emphasis is determined, in part, by the congruence, or fit, among an organization's cultural norms and values and theorizes that the presence of these organizational information processes affects new product outcomes, Survey results indicate that clans dominate the other cultures in predicting organizational market information processes, suggesting that information processes are fundamentally ''people processes'' that involve commitment and trust among organizational members. The results have important implications for balancing internal and external orientations within firms. The results also indicate that the information utilization processes, especially those that are conceptual in nature, are strong predictors of new product performance, timeliness, and creativity, indicating that competitive advantage is tied to information utilization activities in firms.

TI THE EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED INTERDEPENDENCE ON DEALER ATTITUDES
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Channels research has consistently argued that asymmetric channel relationships are more dysfunctional than those characterized by symmetric interdependence, The authors propose that the degree of both interdependence asymmetry and total interdependence affect the level of interfirm conflict, trust, and commitment. Using survey data from automobile dealers, they demonstrate that, with increasing interdependence asymmetry, the dealer's trust in and commitment to the supplier decline while interfirm conflict increases, In addition, they demonstrate that relationships with greater total interdependence exhibit higher trust, stronger commitment, and lower conflict than relationships with lower interdependence. The effects on conflict are consistent with those predicted by bilateral deterrence theory, and the effects on trust and commitment are in accord with the authors' bilateral convergence predictions.

TI USING EXTREMES TO DESIGN PRODUCTS AND SEGMENT MARKETS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Current marketing methodologies used to study consumers are inadequate for identifying and understanding respondents whose preferences for a product offering are most extreme. These ''extreme respondents'' have important implications for product design and market segmentation decisions. The authors develop a hierarchical Bayes random-effects model and apply it to a conjoint study of credit card attributes. Their proposed model facilitates an in-depth study of respondent heterogeneity, especially of extreme respondents. The authors demonstrate the importance of characterizing extremes in identifying product attributes and predicting the success of potential products.

TI MODELING CONSUMERS CHOICES OF MULTIPLE ITEMS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Contemporary choice models focus on choice opportunities in which consumers purchase a quantity of a single item in a product category, However, failing to recognize the possibility of assortments of multiple-item purchases can lead to incorrect conclusions about the impact of past purchase behavior on current choices. The authors propose a model that allows for multiple-item shopping trips and apply it to scanner data for powdered soft drinks. The model provides descriptions about the influence of (1) consumer's prior behavior across previous shopping trips, (2) behavior within the same shopping trip, (3) the in-store shelf assortment available at the time of purchase, and (4) marketing mix variables on multiple-item shopping trip choices, The authors' model provides better choice predictions in a holdout sample at the aggregate and assortment composition levels than a traditional, single-purchase choice model. Using the model, they present simulation and naturally occurring experiment results in the powdered soft drinks category, Finally, they discuss the value of their results for understanding the consequences of consumers' choices and their implications for manufacturers.

TI DOUBLE COUPONING AND RETAIL PRICING IN A COUPONED PRODUCT CATEGORY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB A common practice in many supermarkets is double, and in some cases, triple couponing. Retail managers adopting this policy react emotionally to couponing by manufacturers: They ''won't tolerate dumping in this marketplace by manufacturers who run 25 cents coupons elsewhere, but 50 cents coupons [t]here.'' How justified are retail managers in their claims? Does it really benefit manufacturers to do this? How is the retail pricing of the category affected by the double-couponing policy? And, what happens to the competing retailer that does not double coupon? The authors provide answers to these questions. They use a game theoretic model to (1) study the effects of double couponing, (2) derive the equilibrium level of couponing by manufacturers, and (3) derive the double-couponing retailer's retail pricing of brands in the category, as well as the pricing of the competing retailer that does not follow the double-couponing policy. The authors then test their results using primary data on retail prices.

TI A SINGLE IDEAL POINT MODEL FOR MARKET-STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Computing unsegmented product maps from preference data by means of single ideal point models is commonly thought to be impossible because of indeterminacy problems. The authors show that this mathematical indeterminacy can be overcome by incorporating dependent sampling assumptions into a probabilistic multidimensional scaling (MDS) model. As a result, product space maps can be estimated for single markets from preference data alone, If desired, dissimilarity data can be combined with preference data to produce jointly estimated product space maps. The authors illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach with real and simulated data. They also make comparisons to both internal and external deterministic models. The results are favorable.

TI ISOLATING THE DETERMINANTS OF INNOVATIVENESS - A SPLIT-POPULATION TOBIT
   (SPOT) DURATION MODEL OF TIMING AND VOLUME OF FIRST AND REPEAT PURCHASE
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors present the Split-Population Tobit (SPOT) duration model to incorporate two conceptually distinct dimensions of innovativeness in a single framework, namely, the timing and volume of adoption. Rather than utilizing a diffusion model specification based on word-of-mouth and social contagion effects, the present approach uses a growth model specification and delineates a general function of time to describe the distribution of adoption timing. Estimation and several validation exercises performed on a data set describing the diffusion of personal computers across a sample of over 3000 U.S. firms provide strong support for the superiority of the SPOT model over models derived from restricted conceptualizations of innovativeness. The empirical work, albeit modest, tests the impact of covariates, such as firm-size and decision-centralization, on the dimensions of innovativeness and sheds light on some inconsistent findings in the innovation adoption literature. The authors subsequently derive the extended SPOT model (EXT-SPOT) to incorporate repeat purchase volume and timing in the SPOT framework, Finally, they discuss limitations, further research directions, and implications for the practitioner.

TI IMPLICATIONS FOR ASYMMETRY, NONPROPORTIONALITY, AND HETEROGENEITY IN
   BRAND SWITCHING FROM PIECE-WISE EXPONENTIAL MIXTURE HAZARD MODELS
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop a class of mixtures of piece-wise exponential hazard models for the analysis of brand switching behavior. The models enable the effects of marketing variables to change nonproportionally over time and can, simultaneously, be used to identify segments among which switching and repeat buying behavior differ. Several forms of asymmetry in brand switching are accommodated. The authors provide an application to the analysis of scanner panel data on ketchup, which illustrates the implications for asymmetry, nonproportionality, and heterogeneity. The results show that the model predicts purchases and purchase timing in holdout data better than the models proposed by Kamakura and Russell (1989) and Vilcassim and Jain (1991).

TI THE IMPACT OF AFFECTIVE REACTIONS ON ATTITUDES TOWARD THE ADVERTISEMENT
   AND THE BRAND - A STEP TOWARD ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author investigates the impact of affective reactions elicited by television advertisements on two variables of major interest in advertising: attitude toward the advertisement (Aad) and postexposure brand attitude (A(bp)). Previous research has suffered from using non-natural settings, verbal measures of affect, and unknown brands. The author's study avoids forced exposure, uses a real program in which real commercials for unknown and known brands were embedded, and interviews subjects after they have viewed all the commercials. Thus, it offers a more natural setting in which to examine whether previously established relations between affective reactions and Aad and attitude toward the brand (A(b)) still hold. The author measures affective reactions through facial expressions, as well as classical verbal measures, and finds that the contribution of affective responses to Aad and A(bp) is evident for verbal, but not facial, measures of affect. The impact of affective responses varies in a theoretically predictable way across familiar and unfamiliar brands, with the latter being more influenced by verbal affective reactions generated by the advertisement. The author presents several explanations for the results and offers issues for further research.

TI Branded variants: A retail perspective
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Manufacturers frequently offer myriad variations of a branded product. In many cases, manufacturers have tens to hundreds of models. Seiko wrist watches, for example, may come with different bands, chimes, and special features. The authors call these variations branded Variants and suggest that manufacturers offer branded variants for the benefit of their most direct customers-retailers. With branded variants, a consumer must remember, evaluate, and process a wider variety of product features to make comparisons across variants and retail outlets. The authors suggest that as branded variants increase, some consumers experience an increased cost of shopping for a branded product across retail stores. Consequently, fewer consumers shop across retail stores. This reduced shopping translates into reduced competition across retail stores, which encourages (1) more retailers to carry a branded product and (2) retailers to supply that branded product with more retail service support. The authors use data from three retailers across 14 product categories to demonstrate that a branded product with more variants often has greater retail availability and higher levels of retail service.

TI Measuring the dynamic effects of promotions on brand choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Promotions are being used with increasing frequency by manufacturers facing highly competitive markets, which is causing concern among some marketers who feel that frequent promotions can hurt a brand. Nevertheless, there is little empirical evidence to either support or dispel such fears. To fill this gap in the literature, the authors propose a brand choice model that provides an estimate of the dynamic effects of promotions on loyalty to the brand and customers' sensitivity to the price of the brand, and measures whether promotional purchases reinforce or reduce subsequent response to similar promotions. They estimate a random effects heteroskedastic covariance probit time-varying parameter model on household scanner panel data from the liquid detergent category. Their results indicate that increased purchases using coupons erode brand loyalty and increase price sensitivity. In addition, the authors find that the effect of features and displays on brand choice is reinforced by prior feature and display purchases, respectivly, as well as by feature and display purchases associated with price cuts. Future research directions are also discussed.

TI The effect of new product features on brand choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Companies often introduce new product features to differentiate their brands and gain a competitive advantage, The authors investigate factors that moderate the impact of a new feature on brand choice, Building on two principles, multiattribute diminishing sensitivity and performance uncertainty, they propose that the characteristics of the products to which new features are added are important determinants of the impact of these features on sales and market share, Specifically, in six studies, they show that a new feature adds greater value and increases the choice share of a brand more when the brand (1) has relatively inferior existing features, (2) is associated with lower (perceived) quality, (3) has a higher price, and (4) is both high-priced and high-quality, The results also suggest that the addition of a new feature reduces buyers' price sensitivity for low-quality, but not for high-quality, brands and that multiattribute diminishing sensitivity is a more important moderator of the effect of new features than performance uncertainty. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

TI Market intelligence dissemination across functional boundaries
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors extend previous research by examining antecedents and consequences of the market intelligence dissemination process across functional boundaries. Their study, involving 788 nonmarketing managers in high-tech equipment manufacturing companies, suggests that both dissemination frequency and formality have nonlinear effects on perceived intelligence quality. In addition, they find evidence of a mere formality effect; that is, intelligence received through formal channels appears to be used more than that obtained through informal channels. The authors also find that the frequency with which market intelligence is disseminated is related to interfunctional distance, joint customer visits, senders' positional power, a receiver's organizational commitment, and trust in a sender. Additionally they find the formality of the dissemination process is shaped by interfunctional distance, receivers' trust in senders, and structural flux. Interestingly, the effects of internal environmental volatility (i.e., structural flux) appear to be different from those of external environmental volatility(i.e., market dynamism). For example, structural flux is found to affect dissemination formality, but not frequency, whereas the opposite is true for market dynamism.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author applies a hierarchical regression model to analyze the simultaneous effects of Hispanic and Angle interviewer and respondent ethnicity and gender on response quality in survey research. Although few significant main effects were found, response quality was affected significantly by interaction effects of respondent and interviewer ethnicity and gender, For the most part, ethnically homophilous and gender-heterophilous interviews generate the highest response quality. Both Hispanic and Angle respondents deferred to an interviewer of a different ethnic background when queried about the interviewer's culture, but not when asked noncultural, albeit sensitive, questions.

TI Metric conjoint segmentation methods: A Monte Carlo comparison
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors compare nine metric conjoint segmentation methods. Four methods concern two-stage procedures in which the estimation of conjoint models and the partitioning of the sample are performed separately; in five, the estimation and segmentation stages are integrated. The methods are compared conceptually and empirically in a Monte Carlo study. The empirical comparison pertains to measures that assess parameter recovery, goodness-of-fit, and predictive accuracy. Most of the integrated conjoint segmentation methods outperform the two-stage clustering procedures under the conditions specified, in which a latent class procedure performs best. However, differences in predictive accuracy were small. The effects of degrees of freedom for error and the number of respondents were considerably smaller than those of number of segments, error variance, and within-segment heterogeneity.

TI Pricing a bundle of products or services: The case of nonprofits
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors determine the optimal number of items to be included in a service bundle for a profit-maximizing firm that uses pure components, pure bundling, or mixed bundling strategies. When applied to Venkatesh and Mahajan's (1993) data, the number of events held is shown to have a substantial impact on firm profits. The authors also study the pricing strategies of a nonprofit organization that seeks to maximize usage subject to a nondeficit constraint. Using the same data, the authors show that compared to a profit maximizing firm, a usage-maximizing nonprofit organization (1) charges lower prices, (2) holds more events, and (3) takes fixed costs into account in setting prices. For the distributions considered by Venkatesh and Mahajan (1993), there is a reversal in the order of preferred strategies, with the pure-bundling strategy dominating the single ticket strategy, though mixed bundling is still the most preferred strategy. In addition, the authors find that attendance is not maximized by offering the greatest possible number of events. The effects of alternative objective functions, such as surplus maximization, and additional bundling policies (adding bundles consisting of only some of the events scheduled) are also examined.

Their easily described purchase frequency distributions subsume many previous models and provide a connection between mixed Poisson marketing models and the conceptually distinct compound Poisson models. These distributions provide simple parametric equations for individual-level prediction of second-period purchase frequency based on observed first-period purchase frequencies. The results are applied to four marketing panel data sets.

The results of two studies show that the answers to questions sent by fax were comparable to those received by mail, but they were received more quickly and in greater numbers. For many types of surveys that otherwise would have used mail, using fax machines can yield higher returns at lower cost per returned questionnaire.

TI A Bayesian approach for estimating target market potential with limited
   geodemographic information
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop a Bayesian approach for inferring the joint distribution of several demographic variables when only information about the marginal distribution of each variable is known and when there is prior information about the correlation between the variables, Using public domain U.S. Census Bureau geodemographic data for Sioux Falls and the state of South Dakota, they apply the approach to four specific marketing problems, two involving direct mail advertising campaigns and two involving the location of a retail site. The empirical applications illustrate the serious bias that results from the assumption that the demographic variables are independent of each other, Overall, the Bayesian approach recovers the underlying joint distribution of the variables of interest well and is unique in its ability to provide a measure of uncertainty about the resulting estimates, Hypothesis testing and the construction of confidence intervals are illustrated in the context of a retail site location application. The results of a Monte Carte experiment indicate that the Bayesian approach recovers joint densities under a variety of conditions in a robust manner.

TI Do consumers overgeneralize one-sided comparative price claims, and are
   more stringent regulations needed?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The Federal Trade Commission seems to be moving toward more stringent regulations that would disallow certain omissions in one-sided comparative ad claims. The changes would address long-standing concerns that such claims erroneously imply that the advertised brand is superior, not only on the featured attribute, but also on omitted and seemingly related attributes. The author substantiates such concerns: Subjects who saw comparative price claims mistakenly infered that the advertised brand was least expensive overall and made suboptimal choices, though they could have found the omitted prices. As predicted, subjects were most likely to overgeneralize the most reliable-looking and informative claim-the one that (1) named the targeted competitor and (2) specified the savings amount. In addition, a disclosure was ineffective. The author concludes with recommendations for limited added regulations.

TI Limited choice sets, local price response, and implied measures of price
   competition
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB It is becoming increasingly evident that a consumer's brand choice decision in low-involvement categories does not involve full search, evaluation, and comparison of price information of all brands available at point of purchase (global price response). The authors propose a two-stage choice process in which the consumer first identifies a subset of brands within the universal set of brands called the choice set and then evaluates only those brands that are in the choice set relative to one another to select a single brand. The authors find that, consistent with reports of the extent of external price search of consumers, response to shelf price variations is limited to the brands in the choice set (local price response). Their results indicate that employing the assumption of global price response may lead to biased estimates of price elasticity and derived measures of clout and vulnerability, To enable a managerially meaningful and useful assessment of a brand's competitive clout and vulnerability, the authors provide a brand-level approach to integrate local price response into the derivation of these measures.

TI In search of the marketing imagination: Factors affecting the creativity
   of marketing programs for mature products
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The profitability of established products is affected greatly by the extent to which they are meaningfully differentiated from competing alternatives. Maintaining meaningful differentiation, in turn, is facilitated by ongoing development of creative marketing programs. Although marketplace observation reveals a general lack of creativity in the way established products are marketed, some product managers are able to devise creative marketing programs for their products. The authors test hypotheses concerning the effects of individual (i.e., product manager) and situational (i.e., planning process) characteristics on marketing program creativity. The findings reveal that marketing program creativity is a function of individual problem-solving inputs (e.g., knowledge of the marketing environment, diversity of experience, diversity of education), motivational factors (e.g., intrinsic motivation, risk taking), and situational factors (e.g., planning process formalization, interaction with others, time pressure).

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Managers are often advised, ''beat your competitors,'' which sometimes contrasts with the advice, ''do the best for your firm.'' This may lead managers to focus on comparative measures such as market share, Drawing on game theory, the authors hypothesize that managers are competitor oriented under certain conditions, in particular, when they are provided with information about competitors' performance, Empirical studies lead to the additional hypothesis that a competitor orientation is detrimental to performance, To examine these hypotheses, the authors conduct two studies, The first is a laboratory study in which 1016 subjects made pricing decisions, When information about the competitor's profits was provided, over 40% of the subjects were willing to sacrifice part of their company's profits to beat or harm the competitor. Such competitor-oriented behavior occurred across a variety of treatments, The second is a field study used to examine the performance over a half-century of 20 large U.S. firms with differing objectives. Firms with competitor-oriented (market share) objectives were less profitable and less likely to survive than those whose objectives were directly oriented to profits.

In a longitudinal field study, the authors investigate how the beliefs and preferences of individual actors in a collective decision developed and changed. This provides a rare opportunity to relate beliefs and social influence to articulated preferences, as well as to evaluate the basic assumptions that underlie persuasive arguments theory, a prominent theory of group polarization. Econometric models are employed to test proposed relationships between group processes and outcomes. A model incorporating both cognitive and social process variables accurately predicts 95% of the actors' top choices. The authors provide new insights for understanding the dynamics underlying group polarization and exploring group processes in marketing.

TI Competitive-component analysis: A new approach to calibrating asymmetric
   market-share models
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Managers are unlikely to keep current with advanced developments in market-response analysis, and technical analysts often lack the marketplace knowledge of the many product categories they must track through syndicated data; this is a recipe for bad decisions. The authors present methods based on three-mode factor analysis and multivariate regression that can help both analysts and managers make better decisions regarding whether UPCs should be aggregated into brand units and, if so, how should the aggregation be done; which marketing instruments to track; and how to disentangle correlated promotional strategies. The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to UPC-level data (25 UPCs, seven marketing instruments, and 156 weeks). In this example, to aggregate UPCs within a manufacturer into brand units would distort the relations between the marketing instruments and market responses. A multivariate regression from the competitive-component scores provides a methodologically sound and practical method for calibrating market response in such cases.

TI Internal customers and internal suppliers
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB To push a customer and market orientation deep into the organization, many firms have adopted systems by which internal customers evaluate internal suppliers. The internal supplier receives a larger bonus for a higher evaluation, The authors examine two internal customer-internal supplier incentive systems. In one system, the internal customer provides the evaluation implicitly by selecting the percentage of its bonus that is based on market outcomes (e.g., a combination of net sales and customer satisfaction if these measures can be tied to incremental profits), The internal supplier's reward is based on the percentage that the internal customer chooses. In the second system, the internal customer selects target market outcomes, and the internal supplier is rewarded on the basis of the target. in each incentive system, some risk is transferred from the firm to the employees, and the firm must pay for this; but in return, the firm need not observe either the internal supplier's or the internal customer's actions. The incentive systems are robust even if the firm guesses wrongly about what employees perceive as costly and about how employee actions affect profit. The authors discuss how these systems relate to internal customer satisfaction systems and profit centers.

TI Why switch? Product category-level explanations for true variety-seeking
   behavior
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors address two key issues that have received inadequate attention in the choice behavior literature on variety seeking. First, they explicitly separate true variety-seeking behavior (i.e., intrinsically motivated) from derived varied behavior (i.e., extrinsically motivated). Second, they hypothesize variety-seeking behavior to be a function of the individual difference characteristic of need for variety and product category-level characteristics that interact to determine the situations in which variety seeking is more likely to occur relative to repeat purchasing and derived varied behavior. The authors test their hypotheses in a field study of Dutch consumers, which assesses both the intensity of brand switching and the underlying motives for their switching behavior. Results support the importance of isolating variety switches from derived switches and of considering product category-level factors as an explanation for the occurrence of variety-seeking behavior.

TI Building market structures from consumer preferences
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors present a model that maps competitive market structures by identifying the preference structure of each consumer segment. By marrying two different data types - switching probabilities and attribute ratings - their model divides a market into several homogeneous submarkets in which consumers consider a distinctive subset of brands (consideration set or competitive group) with a segment-specific rule for attribute evaluations and a segment-specific ideal point. using data published in Harshman and colleagues' (1982) work, the authors examine the U.S. car market and find brand-loyal segments for all car types except those favored by first-time buyers, a universal market, and five switching segments that consider car groups differing in the nation of origin, size, and luxury level. Breaking the switching segment into finer partitions gives a better account of the data than the Colombo-Morrison model or an asymmetric generalization of that model. The authors advocate the development of marketing goals with respect to each of the segment maps in the hope that it will lead to more synergistic marketing strategies for brands encountering multifaceted competition.

TI The importance of utility balance in efficient choice designs
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Choice designs traditionally have been built under the assumption that all coefficients are zero, The authors show that if there are reasonable nonzero priors for expected coefficients, then these can be used to generate more statistically efficient choice designs, because the alternatives in their choice sets are balanced in utility - they have more similar choice probabilities. The authors demonstrate that the appropriate measure of choice design efficiency requires probability centering and weighting of the rows of the design matrix, and they illustrate how this criterion enables the analyst to appropriately trade off utility balance against three other principles: orthogonality, level balance, and minimal overlap. Two methods, swapping and relabeling attribute levels, provide complementary ways to increase the utility balance of choice designs. The authors apply a process for generating utility-balanced designs to five different choice designs and show that it reduces by 10-50% the number of respondents needed to achieve a specific error level around the parameters. A sensitivity analysis reveals that these gains are diminished, but still substantial, despite strong misspecifications of prior parameter estimates.

TI An investigation of the mediational mechanisms underlying attitudinal
   conditioning
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the two principal mechanisms that have been proposed as possible explanations for the effects of classical conditioning procedures in attitude-shaping applications. They report two experiments that test conditioning procedures for prompting inferential beliefs, versus transferring affect, as means to influencing brand attitudes. Both studies use an established empirical paradigm for shaping brand attitudes with pictures or visual images as the unconditioned stimuli. The results indicate that brand attitudes can be conditioned using both attractive images that promote direct affect transfer and descriptive visual images that promote inferential belief formation. These data suggest that conditioning procedures can produce multiple benefits when they are applied in selecting and arranging the nonverbal cues to be featured in an advertising campaign.

TI Controlling for observed and unobserved managerial skills in determining
   first-mover market share advantages
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Empirical research on pioneering advantage establishes a strong association between pioneering and market share. Researchers, however, suggest that managerial skills may account for the relationship and underscore the need to control for such skills. The authors develop efficiency measures to represent a firm's managerial skills, employing the data envelopment analysis framework as well as a regression-based approach. Furthermore, they account for unobserved, firm-specific factors that include unobserved managerial skills. With such systematic control for observed and unobserved managerial skills, they reexamine the impact of pioneering on market share and find that it is robust even after they control for managerial skills.

TI Joint segmentation on distinct interdependent bases with categorical
   data
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors discuss a latent class framework for market segmentation with categorical data on two conceptually distinct but possibly interdependent bases for segmentation (e.g,, benefits sought and usage of products and services). The joint latent segmentation model explicitly considers potential interdependence between the bases at the segment level by specifying the joint distribution of latent classes over the two bases, while simultaneously extracting segments on each distinct basis. An EM algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters. The authors present an empirical application, using pick-any data collected by a regional bank on two popular, conceptually appealing, and interdependent bases for segmenting customers of financial services - benefits (i.e., desired financial goals) and product usage (of an array of banking services). A comparative evaluation of the approach on synthetic data demonstrates the ability of the modeling framework to detect and estimate the interdependence structure underlying the two segmentation bases and thereby provide more accurate segmentation than ''traditional'' (single-basis) latent segmentation methods.

TI Modifying cluster-based segments to enhance agreement with an exogenous
   response variable
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB K-means clustering programs are frequently used to group buyers into market segments. Segment members exhibit similar background profiles, based on such characteristics as psychographics, benefits seeking, conjoint-based partworths, and so on. In addition, researchers also may use data on one or more exogenous variables for the same respondents. The authors describe and apply an algorithm for systematically modifying the original K-means segmentation to enhance prediction of an exogenous variable (either continuous or categorical). The modification is designed to respect a user-specified constraint on the permissible percentage decrease in the initial partition's ratio of among-groups sums of squares to total-groups sums of squares. The authors compare this approach with models drawn from the highly popular clusterwise regression literature.

TI Consideration sets in conjoint analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors model product consideration as preceding choice in a segment-level conjoint model. They propose a latent-class tobit model to estimate cardinal, segment-level preference functions based on consumers' preference ratings for product concepts considered worth adding to consumers' self-explicated consideration sets. The probability with which the utility of a product profile exceeds an unobserved threshold corresponds to its consideration probability, which is assumed to be independent across product profiles and common to consumers in a segment. A market-share simulation compares the predictions of the proposed model with those obtained from an individual-level tobit model and from traditional ratings-based conjoint analysis. The authors also report simulations that assess the robustness of the proposed estimation procedure, which uses an E-M algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates.

TI Do household scanner data provide representative inferences from brand

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate whether household scanner data provide representative inferences about brand choice behavior. They show the (analytical) equivalence of the homogeneous brand choice logit and the multinomial store sales models, Then, they determine how results for the homogeneous logit model estimated with actual household data deviate from results for the multinomial model estimated with actual store data from the same community, They also perform this comparison using model specifications that provide average estimated parameters while accommodating unobserved household heterogeneity, The authors find statistical support for the hypothesis that panelist households are not representative, whether household heterogeneity is or is not accommodated, Substantively, however, the average estimated price elasticities are close for the household and store data analyzed, if the household data are selected on the basis of purchase selection. An alternative selection procedure, called household selection, which is used for the analysis of complete household purchase records, provides results that strongly differ from the purchase selection results.

AB Drawing on a consumer preference distribution structure postulated in analytical modeling research, the author develops a Separate Effects Model that separates the total discount effect of a competing high-priced brand on the sales of the focal low-priced brand into discount effect in the region where price of the competing brand is (1) above the price of the focal brand, (2) equal to the price of the focal brand, and (3) below the price of the focal brand, The author applies the model to store-level data on fabric softener and illustrates the steps involved in the estimation and usefulness of model results, In particular, he shows that the Separate Effects Model can (1) identify the source of the discount effect observed in the conventional model, (2) uncover discount effects not detected in the conventional model, and (3) guide managers' decisions related to discount sizes and provide some insights about brand strength. An interesting substantive finding from the empirical analysis is that the leading national brand can draw sales from competing brands without reducing its price below the price of the other brands.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the effect of type of elaboration on information processing and product judgments Research participants were shown print advertisements promoting a camera in which the pictorial material depicted either product features mentioned in the copy (attribute-focused condition) or people, objects, or usage occasions captured by the camera (image-focused condition). These advertisements were presented in the context of advertisements for competing brands of camel as or for products in categories unrelated to cameras. When the context was composed of competing cameras, the attribute-focused advertisement resulted in more favorable target camera judgments than did the image-focused advertisement, whereas when products unrelated to cameras served as the context, the image-focused advertisement prompted more favorable judgments. These results are interpreted as evidence that product judgments are more favorable when an advertising message receives two types of elaboration, item-specific and relational, than when only one of these types of elaboration is dominant.

Does the optimal length vary between different products? Does the optimal length vary between different consumers? They analyze 225 cases from the motor vehicle industry and 46 cases from the computer industry with regard to number and length of demonstrations offered and relate the findings to their theoretical model. The empirical results yield strong support for their theory They also find that most firms offered a longer demonstration than needed and failed to use an appropriate segmentation technique for optimizing the demonstration with respect as different consumer groups.

TI Controlling supplier opportunism in industrial relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The recent marketing literature reflects a growing interest in relationship management issues. In particular, several recent studies have drawn on transaction cost and agency theory to examine how interfirm relationships are organized. The general premise is that explicit control mechanisms must be deployed in a relationship to manage a partner's potential opportunism. Although previous research has shown that different mechanisms can be used, the tendency has been to examine individual mechanisms in isolation. The authors develop hypotheses about interdependencies between different control mechanisms. They also identify some of the contextual factors that influence their use. The framework is tested empirically by examining how chemical manufacturers organize their supplier relationships. The results generally support the hypothesis that firms' choices among control mechanisms are influenced by contextual factors. Only limited support is found for the hypothesis that interdependencies exist between different mechanisms.

TI Modeling consumer choice among SKUs
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Most choice models in marketing implicitly assume that the fundamental unit of analysis is the brand, In reality, however, many more of the decisions made by consumers, manufacturers, and retailers occur at the level of the stock-keeping unit (SKU). The authors address a variety of issues involved in defining and using SKUs in a choice model, as well as the unique benefits that arise from doing so. They discuss how a set of discrete attributes (e.g., brand name, package size, type) can be used to characterize a large set of SKUs in a parsimonious manner. They postulate that consumers do not form preferences for each individual SKU, per se, but instead evaluate the underlying attributes that describe each item, The model is shown to be substantially superior to a more traditional framework that does not emphasize the complete use of SKU attribute information. Their analysis also highlights several other benefits associated with the proposed modeling approach, such as the ability to forecast sales for imitative line extensions that enter the market in a future period, Other implications and extensions also are discussed.

TI Composite branding alliances: An investigation of extension and feedback
   effects
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors report two studies investigating the effectiveness of a composite brand in a brand extension context. In composite brand extension, a combination of two existing brand names in different positions as header and modifier is used as the brand name for a new product (e.g., Slim-Fast chocolate cakemix by Godiva). The results of both studies reveal that by combining two brands with complementary attribute levels, a composite brand extension appears to have a better attribute profile than a direct extension of the header brand (Study 1) and has a better attribute profile when it consists of two complementary brands than when it consists of two highly favorable but not complementary brands (Study 2). The improved attribute profile seems to enhance a composite's effectiveness in influencing consumer choice and preference (Study 2). In addition, the positions of the constituent brand names in the composite brand name are found to be important in the formation of the composite's attribute profile and its feedback effects on the constituent brands. A composite brand extension has different attribute profiles and feedback effects, depending on the positions of the constituent brand names.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop and test a simple conceptual model linking product development cycle time to organizational performance. Using data from two industries (automobile and computer) and four countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States), they find that faster cycle time alone is not associated with higher accounting returns, sales growth, or perceived overall performance. Stronger support is found for the hypothesis that some product development practices, such as crossfunctional teams and advanced design tools, interact with accelerated product development to improve performance, whereas other practices such as reverse engineering of competitors' products, suppress the potential benefits from lower cycle times. Finally, interaction effects for other organizational practices, such as customer involvement in the product development process and the extent to which new technology is obtained from external sources, appear to vary by industry.

The research quantifies how product development cycle times increase with increased product complexity and with product newness, how using a cross-functional team interacts with product newness in the way it acts to reduce cycle time, and how using a formal product development process interacts with product complexity in the way it acts to decrease cycle time. The findings suggest that using cross-functional teams is more important in projects in which less of the design is a carryover from a previous generation. Teams then had a large impact in reducing product development cycle times. In contrast, implementing a well thought-out process is more important in firms (or divisions of firms) developing complex products or services. The more complex a product, the more time a formal process eliminates from the development cycle.

TI Advantages of time-based new product development in a fast-cycle
   industry
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors study the impact of time-based product development on sustainable market share gains in a high-technology computer component industry. Three dominant firms, with international new product development and manufacturing facilities, have introduced more than 200 new products into this fast-cycle market in a five-year period. The authors systematically examine the leads and lags at critical stages of the product development process: concept generation, prototype completion, and volume production. Their main finding is that lead-time advantage affects market share positively, albeit differentially, at each stage. The benefit of lead-time gain is greatest at the volume production stage, followed by the concept generation stage. The authors also develop a new notion of lead-time threshold-a time period in which if a competitor catches up, no market share gain is achieved by the firm that introduces the product first. They endogenously estimate the magnitude of the threshold for each stage of the product development process, observing that a significant threshold is present at both the concept generation and volume production stages. Finally, the structure of the development process, which differs across the firms in the market, affords significant differential ability to catch up with competitors.

TI Too little, too early: Introduction timing and new product performance
   in the personal digital assistant industry
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors address the following key questions: (1) When should a firm introduce a new product? (2) What should its performance level be? and (3) How do the decisions of a competing firm affect a firm's timing and product performance decisions? The authors present a detailed case study of the initial competitors in the personal digital assistant (PDA) industry on the basis of which they construct a stylized game-theoretic model of entry timing and product performance level decisions in a duopoly. Situations in which the duopolists are symmetric as well as asymmetric in terms of their estimates of market size and product development capabilities are considered. When firms are symmetric, the authors show that an equilibrium exists when the firms enter at different times with different performance levels. In the asymmetric cases, the firm that has a higher estimate of market size enters first, as does the firm with a superior development process. The performance level decisions, however, depend on the sensitivity of demand to this variable. The results provide one explanation for empirical observations that market pioneers maintain their leadership in some cases, and later entrants eventually dominate in other cases. The authors then relate the model results to actual decisions in the PDA market, finding that Apple's Newton was ''too little, too early.''

TI The determinants of Japanese new product successes
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors report the results from a three-year study of new product development practices in Japanese firms. They develop a causal model of factors correlated with new product success. They test the model using data collected on 788 new products developed and commercialized by Japanese firms in the past four years. The ''best practices'' identified in this study suggest that Japanese new product success is positively influenced by the level of cross-functional integration and information sharing, the firm's marketing and technical resources and skills, the proficiency of the new product development activities undertaken, and the nature of market conditions, Cross-functional integration and product competitive advantage are two key determinants of new product success. The authors also discuss managerial and research implications.

TI Strategic orientation of the firm and new product performance
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors seek to understand which of three different strategic orientations of the firm (customer, competitive, and technological) is more appropriate, when, and why it is so in the context of developing product innovations. They propose a structural model of the impact of the strategic orientation of the firm on the performance of a new product. The results provide evidence for best practices as follows: (1) A firm wishing to develop an innovation superior to the competition must have a strong technological orientation; (2) a competitive orientation in high-growth markets is useful because it enables firms to develop innovations with lower costs, which is a critical element of success'; (3) firms should be consumer- and technology-oriented in markets in which demand is relatively uncertain-together, these orientations lead to products that perform better, and the firm will be able to market innovations better, thereby achieving a superior level of performance; and (4) a competitive orientation is useful to market innovations when demand is not too uncertain but should be de-emphasized in highly uncertain markets.

TI The impact of organizational memory on new product performance and
   creativity
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Arguing that organizational memory affects key new product development processes by influencing the (1) interpretation of incoming information and (2) the performance of new product action routines, the authors introduce four dimensions of organizational memory, including the amount and dispersion of memory. Data from 92 new product development projects indicate that higher organizational memory levels enhance the shortterm financial performance of new products, whereas greater memory dispersion increases both the performance and creativity of new products. They also find, however, that under some conditions Of high environmental turbulence, high memory dispersion actually detracts from creativity and has no effect on financial performance, Under conditions of low turbulence, high memory dispersion promotes higher levels of creativity and short-term financial performance. These findings provide some initial evidence that knowledge is not an unconditionally positive asset and suggest that developing and sustaining valuable organizational memory may require attention not only to the appropriate levels of memory but also to managing subtle aspects of memory dispersion and deployment. These results imply that if organizations fail to understand the subtle ways in which different features of organizational memory influence product development, they may fail to harvest the full value of organizational learning.

TI An exploratory investigation of organizational antecedents to new
   product success
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors present a model that suggests that integration between marketing and research and development (R&D), managerial controls, and relational norms influences new product success. The model is tested with a sample of 115 engineers and marketing personnel involved in 19 new product projects for a multinational computer manufacturer. The results indicate that managerial controls influence integration, relational norms, and perceived effectiveness. Integration between marketing and R&D fosters stronger relational norms, perceived effectiveness, and new product success, Relational norms enhance perceptions of effectiveness, yet they have a negative influence on new product success. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings for best practice in new product research and application.

TI An anatomy of a decision-support system for developing and launching
   line extensions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB For most firms producing fast-moving consumer packaged goods, line extension is central to their new product development (NPD) strategy. The authors present a decision-support system for managing the NPD process in this industry, which explicitly evaluates the financial prospects of new line extension concepts. The system developed is based on an in-depth analysis of 51 new product projects launched over a three-year period at a major food manufacturer. It embodies historical knowledge about the productivity of the firm's NPD process and captures some key research and development resource inputs that can affect this productivity. It also provides shipment forecasts at various stages of the NPD process and thus can be used at new product project review gates to evaluate line extension concepts systematically. Finally, the system also can be used to improve the practice of the NPD process by enabling its users to take a product line perspective, using incremental sales evaluation, and by facilitating cross-functional and inter-project learning. Although the system has been developed specifically for a packaged food company environment, its underlying design principles are generic and applicable to a wide range of industries.

TI Some new methods for an old problem: Modeling preference changes and
   competitive market structures in pretest market data
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Despite the enormous amounts of resources devoted to concept and product testing and the continued use of pretest market (PTM) modeling procedures, estimates of new product failures are still alarmingly high. The primary objectives of PTM modeling are to forecast the market share/sales volume of a new product and to determine the sources of new product share at the aggregate market level. The authors describe a new approach that is designed to provide a parsimonious description of competitive changes before and after a new product is introduced by identifying latent segments (i.e,, groups of consumers) that vary in size and composition with respect to the relative preferences for a set of brands before and after a new product is introduced. Each latent segment represents a particular preference state characterized by a set of segment-level choice probabilities. The modeling framework is based on a class of dynamic latent class models that explicitly recognize two major types of preference heterogeneity: (1) heterogeneity caused by before after changes in latent preferences for the brands (i.e., time-varying relative choice probabilities) and/or (2) heterogeneity caused by consumers changing their latent preference segment in response to a new product (i.e., time varying latent segment probabilities), As is demonstrated in the empirical application, the dynamic latent class models provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how a new product changes the competitive landscape.

TI Information acceleration: Validation and lessons from the field
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB There is strong management interest in the use of multimedia stimuli to gather data with which to forecast consumer response to really new products. These vivid methods have high face validity and are attractive to top management, but they have only begun to be tested for validity. The authors evaluate one virtual representation called information acceleration (IA) that has been applied eight times to consumer and business-to-business products. They report on three tests of validity-two internal and one external. The first internal test compares the ability of IA to represent a physical automobile showroom and salesperson. The second internal test compares the ability of IA to represent the interpersonal interaction of a medical technician with a physician when evaluating a new medical instrument. The external test compares forecasts, made in 1992 for a camera launched in 1993, with actual sales for 1993 and 1994. The authors also compare actual sales to forecasts modified for the actual marketing plan and for an unforeseen negative Consumer Reports article. Using real-world applications of IA as a basis, the authors conclude with a summary of the lessons that have been: learned during the past five years.

TI Integrated product design for marketability and manufacturing
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Using as a point of departure previous work in marketing on optimal concept selection that utilizes product attribute-based customer preference and product cost models, the authors consider the concept selection stage of a new product development process. They offer empirical support for the need to push beyond these models to more complete ''customer-ready'' prototypes before choosing a concept to commercialize. Although the correlations between attribute-based predictions, on the one hand, and customer acceptance and product costs, on the other hand, are significant and substantial, too much variance is left unexplained to rely on these models in isolation. This implies that more detailed design work should be performed on several concepts in parallel. The authors also provide an integrated approach for concept generation and selection that leverages the unique strengths of marketing, design, and manufacturing in developing successful products.

TI Pulling the plug to stop the new product drain
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although an important aspect of managing new product introductions is to recognize and quickly take action when a product launch has failed (i.e., ''pull the plug''), senior managers in a new product launch setting tend to remain committed to a losing course of action. The authors investigate this issue with controlled experiments, using senior level executives as subjects. Their results suggest a strong bias toward continued commitment to failing new products. Consequently, the authors devise and test the effectiveness of five decision aids aimed at reducing this bias. Improving the quality of the information environment does not greatly reduce bias, nor does precommitment (at time of launch) to self-specified decisions rules. The most effective methods of reducing commitment to a losing course of action appear to be either precommitment to a predetermined decision rule or introduction of a new decision maker at the time of the stop/no stop decision. Of these two methods, the latter produces marginally less commitment to a losing course of action. However, none of the tested decision procedures completely reduces commitment to a losing course of action relative to the control condition.

TI Attribute-task compatibility as a determinant of consumer preference
   reversals
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors propose that consumers' preferences are systematically affected by whether they make direct comparisons between brands (e.g., a choice task) or evaluate brands individually (e.g., purchase likelihood ratings). In particular ''comparable'' attributes, which produce precise and easy-to-compute comparisons (e.g., price), tend to be relatively more important in comparison-based tasks. Conversely, ''enriched'' attributes (e.g., brand name), which are more difficult to compare but are often more meaningful and informative when evaluated on their own, tend to receive relatively greater weight when preferences are formed on the basis of separate evaluations of individual options. Consistent with this analysis, systematic preference reversals were observed in a series of studies, which tested the proposed explanation on the basis of attribute-task compatibility, demonstrated that the findings generalize across preference elicitation tasks and attributes that have the characteristics prescribed by their theory, and examined rival accounts. The authors discuss the theoretical implications of this research and explore its consequences for the measurement of buyers' preferences and for marketers' pricing, merchandising, distribution, and communications strategies.

TI Patterns of affective reactions to advertisements: The integration of
   moment-to-moment responses into overall judgments
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop several hypotheses regarding the integration of moment-to-moment emotional responses into overall ad judgments, using the psychological literature dealing with people's preferences for sequences of hedonic outcomes, and they conduct three studies to test these predictions, The results of Study 1 indicate that consumers' global assessments of extended affective episodes elicited by advertisements are dominated by the peak emotional experience and the final moment of the series and also are correlated with the pace at which momentary affective reactions improve over time, Ad duration is related only weakly to overall ad judgments, though longer advertisements have an advantage as long as they build toward a peak emotional experience. In Study 2, the authors replicate these findings under more realistic viewing conditions and demonstrate that the results cannot be attributed solely to memory artifacts that are based on recency. Study 3 implicates adaptation as a possible explanation for the preference for delayed peaks and high ends and further explains the weak effects of ad duration by showing experimentally that longer advertisements can both enhance and depress ad judgments depending on how duration affects the peak emotional experience and the final moment.

TI The moderating effects of problem characteristics on experts' and

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB A growing body of literature suggests that experts are little if at all better than novices in terms of the quality of decision outputs, To explain this counter-intuitive finding, the authors propose a conceptual framework that focuses on initial problem structure as a key moderator of the effect of expertise on performance, Specifically, they argue that the expert-novice performance differential should be greatest at moderate levels of problem structure and weakest at both extremes. To examine this central hypothesis, the authors conduct a controlled experiment that compares experts with novices when solving a complex problem that had characteristics of a moderately ill-structured problem, Relative to novices, the authors find that experts select fewer, but more diagnostic, information inputs and are more consistent when evaluating nonquantified inputs, As a result, they make more accurate and tightly clustered judgments than do novices, and. also are more confident in their decisions. To examine the moderating influence of problem characteristics, certain task variables are manipulated to increase or decrease initial problem structure. As hypothesized, the benefits of expertise are less pronounced when solving a problem with increased initial structure.

   choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the long-term effects of promotion and advertising on consumers' brand choice behavior. They use 8 1/4 years of panel data for a frequently purchased packaged good to address two questions: (1) Do consumers' responses to marketing mix variables, such as price, change over a long period of time? (2) If yes, are these changes associated with changes in manufacturers' advertising and retailers' promotional policies? Using these results, the authors draw implications for manufacturers' pricing, advertising, and promotion policies. The authors use a two-stage approach, which permits them to assess the medium-term (quarterly) effects of advertising and promotion as well as their long-term (i.e., over an infinite horizon) effects. Their results are consistent with the hypotheses that consumers become more price and promotion sensitive over time because of reduced advertising and increased promotions.

TI Reliability assessment and optimization of marketing measurement
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Different purposes of measurement reflect corresponding differences in marketing problems underlying the need for measurement. Reliability assessment in marketing, which is based on classical reliability theory, continues to focus on scaling of individual respondents and ignores other purposes of measurement. Besides the shortcomings in reliability assessment, the academic literature does not make any recommendations for efficiencies in scale usage by marketing firms in applied settings. Generalizability theory has long been identified as an alternative psychometric approach that can be applied to design efficient measurement and can explicitly take into account differences in the purpose of measurement. The authors take a generalizability theory perspective to (1) reiterate the rationale for taking into account the purpose of measurement when assessing reliability, (2) propose a general method to optimize the design of marketing measurement in applied studies, and (3) conduct an empirical study on service quality measurement that illustrates the dual advantages of optimizing measurement and the generalizability approach to marketing measurement.

TI Deliberate product definition: Customizing the product definition
   process
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The process of product definition, during which a firm establishes the product specifications, has a vital influence on the success of a product but has attracted little attention from researchers. Conventional wisdom stipulates that a firm should finalize its specifications early in the product development process. However, in industries facing rapid technological change, stiff competition, and uncertain customer needs, specifications set too early could become outdated by the time of market launch, thereby decreasing the product's benefits to the customer. The authors discuss an alternative approach, in which a firm delays commitment to product specifications and finalizes them just in time for the market launch after careful deliberation, thereby benefiting from the evolution of core technologies and customer preferences. Because such an approach introduces new managerial challenges, it would be appropriate only under certain circumstances. The authors develop a simple model of the product definition process that offers insights about how a firm should customize the process to suit its needs. They capture these insights as a managerial framework and illustrate them with industry examples involving the development process for laser printers and network test kits.

The more important attributes for each respondent are identified first using the self-explicated approach. Full-profile conjoint analysis customized to-the respondent's most important attributes then is administered. The conjoint utility function on the limited set of attributes then is combined with the self-explicated utility function on the full set of attributes. Surprisingly, the authors find that the self-explicated approach by itself yields a slightly (but not statistically significantly) higher predictive validity than does the combined approach.

TI Development of family triadic measures for children's purchase influence
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Many past investigations of family members' perceptions of their relative influence in family decision making show a lack of convergence in multiple reports. This, in turn, represents a serious threat to validity in attempts to depict the structure of family decision influence. These studies warn against using single-item measures of family members' influence even in cases involving multiple respondents. In this study, using multiple-respondent, multiple-item data, the authors develop triadic measures of children's influence in four categories of product purchase decisions that exhibit desirable levels of convergent and discriminant validity. The process of measure development and validation demonstrates a methodology that combines the traditional measure purification process, confirmatory factor analysis, and multiple-influence, multiple-rater data analysis procedures.

TI Using market-level data to understand promotion effects in a nonlinear
   model
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors show analytically, empirically, and numerically through simulation that the estimated effects from linearly aggregated market-level data differ substantially from comparable effects that are obtained from store-level data. The magnitude of this difference renders market-level data largely unsuitable for econometric modeling, unless the marketing manager compensates for the bias that results from the incompatible aggregation. The authors introduce a new approach, a relatively simple debiasing procedure derived from simulated data, They show that this debiasing approach results in substantially improved parameter estimates. They illustrate the value of the procedure by applying ii to scanner data for powdered detergents and comparing the debiased parameter estimates to results obtained from store-level da la and an alternative aggregation method that maintains homogeneity for selected promotional activities.

TI Are the parts better than the whole? The effects of decompositional
   questions on judgements of frequent behaviors
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author investigates whether using a decompositional question (which decomposes an event into subcategories and elicits frequencies at the subcategory level) is effective in increasing the accuracy of frequency judgments elicited in consumer surveys. Results of a study show that the decompositional question makes the process of eliciting frequencies less effortful and enhances the accuracy of the elicited frequencies for frequent, irregular behaviors (i.e., occurring at sporadic intervals), but not for frequent, regular behaviors. Mediational analyses confirm that these effects manifest because the decompositional question triggers an episodic recall strategy, which enhances the efficiency of the judgment formulation process for irregular behaviors but interferes with the normal process for regular behaviors.

TI Dimensions of brand personality
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although a considerable amount of research in personality psychology has been done to conceptualize human personality, identify the ''Big Five'' dimensions, and explore the meaning of each dimension, no parallel research has been conducted in consumer behavior on brand personality, Consequently, an understanding of the symbolic use of brands has been limited in the consumer behavior literature. In this research, the author develops a theoretical framework of the brand personality construct by determining the number and nature of dimensions of brand personality (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness). Tc, measure the five brand personality dimensions, a reliable, valid, and generalizable measurement scale is created. Finally, theoretical and practical implications regarding the symbolic use of brands are discussed.

TI Understanding cooperative advertising participation rates in
   conventional channels
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Cooperative advertising plans feature prominently in marketing programs in conventional channels and make up the majority of marketing funds in some product categories, Available data show that cooperative plans vary greatly with respect to their principal feature: the participation rate offered by manufacturers (the fraction of the reseller's advertising costs that the manufacturers pick up), The authors develop two formal models to study the effects of advertising ''spillovers:'' differentiation across competing retailers, and differentiation across competing manufacturers on tt-le participation rate. The models show that more generous participation rates are called for with less targetable media, less differentiated retailers, more differentiated brands, and more upscale products within a category, The authors sketch out a managerial decision framework that incorporates these findings and offer some suggestions for empirical research.

TI A feature-based approach to market segmentation via overlapping
   K-centroids clustering
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Nonhierarchical partitioning techniques are used widely in many marketing applications, particularly in the clustering of consumers, as opposed to brands. These techniques can be extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers, which might result in misinterpretations of the segments, and subsequently to inferring incorrect relationships of segments to independently defined, actionable variables. The authors propose a general approach to market segmentation based on the concept of over-lapping clusters (Shepard and Arabie 1979), wherein each pattern of overlap can be interpreted as a distinct partition. Both K-means and K-medians clustering procedures are special cases of the proposed approach. The suggested procedure can handle relatively large data sets (e.g., 2000 entities), is easily programmable, and hence can be gainfully employed in marketing research.

TI Kalman filter estimation of new product diffusion models
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors introduce a new estimation procedure, Augmented Kalman Filter with Continuous State and Discrete Observations (AKF(C-D)), for estimating diffusion models, This method is directly applicable to differential diffusion models without imposing constraints on the model structure or the nature of the unknown parameters. It provides a systematic way to incorporate prior knowledge about the likely Values of unknown parameters and updates the estimates whets new data become available. The authors compare AKF(G-D) empirically with live other estimation procedures, demonstrating AKF(C-D)'s superior prediction performance. As an extension to the basic AKF(C-D) approach, they also develop a parallel-filters procedure for estimating diffusion models when there is uncertainty about diffusion model structure or prior distributions of the unknown parameters.

TI A household-level television advertising exposure model
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author proposes a household-level television advertising exposure model for media planning that is based on household exposure records, Consistent with the industry practice, managerial input of advertising for the model is gross rating points (GRP) for each ''daypart'' and week, Exposures of each household within each daypart during each week follow a Poisson process with a distinct rate, which is inferred from the household's past exposure history after accounting for the advertising intensity. Because exposure pattern is computed at the household-level, the model accounts for audience accumulation of dayparts combination, which has a considerable managerial importance in media planning, The model is shown to fit the observed exposure pattern well at both disaggregate and aggregate levels, Applications illustrate the effect of changing the level of GRP on reach and frequency and advertising efficacy of different dayparts, The author implements reallocation of the current level of GRP among dayparts using the ''greedy algorithm'' to improve reach.

Variations in these understandings-among knowledge communities as diverse as ethnographers, statisticians, historians, and even practitioners and researchers-yield a rich set of innovations in quantitative tools, experimental designs, data collection instruments, observational methods, sampling procedures, and interpretive frameworks. Research methods, however, must be consonant not only with the way various communities view scientific inquiry, but also with fundamental characteristics of the thought and behavior of customers and managers. Most widely used methods in marketing lack the latter consonance. The author introduces particular insights about thought and behavior from multiple disciplines as design criteria for improving research methods.

TI Interpreting consumers: A hermeneutical framework for deriving marketing
   insights from the texts of consumers' consumption stories
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author describes and illustrates a hermeneutically grounded interpretive framework for deriving marketing-relevant insights from the ''texts'' of consumer stories and gives an overview of the philosophical and theoretical foundations of this approach. Next, the author describes a hermeneutic framework for interpreting the stories consumers tell about their experiences of products, services, brand images, and shopping. An illustrative analysis demonstrates how this framework can be applied to generate three levels of interpretation: (1) discerning the key patterns of meanings expressed by a given consumer in the texts of his or her consumption stories, (2) identifying key patterns of meaning that emerge across the consumption stories expressed by different consumers, and (3) deriving broader conceptual and managerial implications from the analysis of consumer narratives. This hermeneutic approach is compared and contrasted to the means-end chains laddering framework, the ''voice of the customer'' approach to identifying consumer needs, and market-oriented ethnography. The author concludes with a discussion that highlights the types of marketing insights that can result from a hermeneutic interpretation of consumers' consumption stories and then addresses the roles creativity and expertise play in this research orientation.

TI New products, upgrades, and new releases: A rationale for sequential
   product introduction
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Network externality is an important consideration in many high-technology product markets. In these markets, consumers' expectations about the future installed base and the resultant externality benefits play a critical role in their product adoption decisions. The authors investigate the strategic implications of consumer uncertainty regarding network externality and show that a firm can credibly convey private information about future installed base through its new product introduction strategy. The authors initially consider a market in which consumers are homogeneous in their valuation of quality. They show that under complete information the optimal strategy entails provision of full (efficient) quality in the first period itself, providing any upgrade in the second period is suboptimal. However, under asymmetric information about externality, a high-externality firm provides less than full quality initially and then makes up for the quality differential through provision of an upgrade in the second period. Thus, underprovision of introductory quality (i.e., withholding quality) serves as a signal of high externality, and upgrades serve as the mechanism for implementation of the signaling strategy. The authors demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in quality valuation, The additional insight here is that signaling entails sequential targeting of segments in addition to sequential provision of quality.

TI Can advertising copy make FSI coupons more effective?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Packaged goods manufacturers distribute cents-off coupons in freestanding inserts (FSIs) in newspapers. Free-standing insert coupons are typically composed of two parts: the coupon per se and a print advertisement. Using two laboratory experiments and a separate analysis of coupon measurements from scanner panels, the authors investigate whether the content of the print advertisement influences the effectiveness of the coupon. Theoretical arguments suggest that the impact on consumer attitudes will depend on the executional cues of the copy, the brand loyalty of the consumers, and the consumer's involvement with the product category. The results support the theoretical framework and suggest that it is possible to make FSI coupons more effective by choosing appropriate executional cues for their advertising copy.

TI A parametric multidimensional unfolding procedure for incomplete
   nonmetric preference/choice set data in marketing research
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Multidimensional unfolding (MDU) is one of the most powerful conceptual and methodological tools used in marketing for product positioning analysis. Unfortunately, the majority of the commercial software programs available for performing such analyses (especially nonmetric analyses) suffer from serious limitations including degenerate solutions, interpretation difficulties, lack of supporting statistical inference and model selection procedures, excessive number of parameters to estimate, requirements of full data sets, and difficulties with local optima. The authors propose a new parametric approach to nonmetric unfolding (PARFOLD) to extend methodological developments in the econometrics and marketing science arenas. The authors develop the technical aspects of the proposed procedure, including options for accommodating incomplete rank orders, constraints, and reparameterizations. Two marketing-related applications are provided: one deals with preferences for snack food items involving complete rank orders, and the second involves incomplete data in which students rank order Master of Business Administration schools in their consideration/application sets. Comparisons are made with existing nonmetric MDU procedures including ALSCAL, PREFMAP, and KYST with respect to several newly proposed diagnostic indices of solution degeneracy and positioning implications. Finally, the authors summarize limitations of the proposed model and offer directions for further research.

TI Coupon attractiveness and coupon proneness: A framework for modeling
   coupon redemption
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The measurement of consumers' coupon proneness and the prediction of their redemption behavior is important to the evaluation of marketers' couponing programs. Although considerable attention has been paid in the couponing literature to the identification of factors that influence coupon usage behavior, relatively little work has been done to develop models that can help managers predict consumer response to specific coupons and design effective coupon promotions. The authors propose a model of coupon redemption that extends previous models of coupon usage by considering the joint effects of coupon attractiveness and coupon proneness on redemption, and does not require explicit measurement of these variables. Empirical application of the model shows that it correctly predicts redemption intentions for nearly 90% of consumers in a holdout sample and substantially outperforms a legit model that includes traditional measures of coupon proneness, coupon characteristics, and demographics. The proposed model also provides insights into consumer response to coupons that are not provided by the legit model. Overall, the model shows considerable promise as an aid to managers in designing coupon promotions and developing precision targeting strategies.

TI Stereographic visual displays and the three-dimensional communication of
   findings in marketing research
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In their attempts to communicate with managers and other interested readers, marketing researchers frequently present complex findings in various sorts of visual displays. These diagrams, charts, maps, pictures, and other figures help elucidate the nature of the relationships and structural patterns involved. However, their ability to communicate is partially limited by their typical restriction to the two-dimensional plane of the printed page. As an aid to overcoming such problems, stereographic techniques permit the construction of three-dimensional representations whose vividness and depth provide greater clarity and enhance interpretability to strengthen the reader's grasp of key concepts. The author illustrates the stereographic approach to three-dimensional communication using general examples closely analogous to relevant applications in marketing research.

AB The extremely short life cycle and the rapid decay in revenues after opening coupled with the rapid and frequent introduction of new competitive products makes the timing of new product introductions in the motion picture industry critical, particularly during the high-revenue Christmas and summer seasons. Each studio wants to capture as much of the season as possible by opening early in the season. At the same time, each wants to avoid head-to-head competition. The authors model competition between two motion pictures in a share attraction framework and conduct an equilibrium analysis of the product introduction timing game in a finite season. The following three different equilibrium configurations emerge: (1) a single equilibrium with both movies opening simultaneously at the beginning of the season, (2) a single equilibrium with one movie opening at the beginning of the season and one delaying, and (3) dual equilibria, with either movie delaying opening. A key factor is the product life cycle, which can be captured well with a two-parameter exponential decline. The authors relate the life-cycle parameters to these possibilities with the general result that the weaker movie may be forced to delay opening. These results are related to case studies of the opening of recently released movies. A statistical analysis of the 1990 summer season in North America provides support for the conclusions and suggests that current release timing decisions can be improved; The authors discuss the rationale of "avoiding the competition" in the general context of product introduction timing.

TI Estimating irregular pricing effects: A stochastic spline regression
   approach
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Markets respond to prices in complex ways, Multiple factors such as price points, odd pricing, and just-noticeable differences often cause steps and spikes in response, The result is market response functions that are frequently nonmonotonic. However, existing regression-based approaches employ functions that are inherently monotonic, which thereby limits representation of important irregularities, In this article, the authors use a stochastic spline regression approach in the framework of a hierarchical Bayes model that permits the estimation of irregular pricing effects and apply the approach to data sets from several product categories. A simulation study indicates that the stochastic spline approach is flexible enough to accommodate irregular response functions, The empirical results show that there are irregularities in own-price response for most of the brands examined and that there are important profit implications of these irregular response functions in pricing decisions, The authors find that the irregularities in the response functions include sales increases associated with odd prices in the range of 12% to 76%, flatness at the extremes of the range of observed prices, and kinks in the response function that are consistent with segmentation effects.

TI Is a company known by the company it keeps? Assessing the spillover
   effects of brand alliances on consumer brand attitudes
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the growing and pervasive phenomenon of brand alliances as they affect consumers' brand attitudes. The results of the main study (n = 350) and two replication studies (n = 150, n = 210) together demonstrate that (1) consumer attitudes toward the brand alliance influence subsequent impressions of each partner's brand (i.e., "spillover" effects), (2) brand familiarity moderates the strength of relations between constructs in a manner consistent with information integration and attitude accessibility theories, and (3) each partner brand is not necessarily affected equally by its participation in a particular alliance. These results represent a first, necessary step in understanding why and how a brand could be affected by "the company it keeps" in its brand alliance relationships.

TI Investigating purchase timing behavior in two related product categories
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors' objective is to investigate the purchase timing behavior of households in two product categories for which the decision of a household to make a purchase in one category at a given point in time influences purchase in the other category. Interdependence in purchase timing between the two categories is modeled using a bivariate hazard function approach that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. The authors provide empirical results from five durable and nondurable goods product category pairs-pasta and pasta sauce, liquid and powder detergents, clothes washers and dryers, soup and yogurt, and room air conditioners and dishwashers. The latter two categories are included in the analysis to ensure that the model can distinguish between true and spurious dependence caused by categories being purchased together. The authors find that the estimated cross-category correlation parameter obtained from the bivariate hazard model is consistent with prior expectations in each of the product categories. As in the literature on univariate hazard models, the authors find the bivariate hazard functions to be nonmonotonic in nature. Using the proposed model, the impact of price reductions in one category on the purchase probabilities in both categories is examined using the pasta/pasta sauce product pair. Given the positive relationship in the purchasing in these two categories, the authors find that a price cut in one category increases the purchase probabilities of both pasta and pasta sauce.

TI Late mover advantage: How innovative late entrants outsell pioneers
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although pioneers outsell late movers in many markets, in some cases innovative late entry has produced some remarkably successful brands that outsell pioneers, The mechanisms through which innovative late movers outsell pioneers are unclear, To identify these mechanisms, the authors develop a brand-level model in which brand sales are decomposed into trials and repeat purchases. The model captures diffusion and marketing mix effects on brand trials and includes the differential impacts of innovative and noninnovative competitors' diffusion on these effects. The authors develop hypotheses on how the diffusion and marketing mix parameters of the brands differ by market entry strategy (pioneering, innovative late entry, and noninnovative late entry), The authors test these hypotheses using data from 13 brands in two pharmaceutical product categories. The results show that an innovative late mover can create a sustainable advantage by enjoying a higher market potential and a higher repeat purchase rate than either the pioneer or noninnovative late movers, growing faster than the pioneer, slowing the pioneer's diffusion, and reducing the pioneer's marketing spending effectiveness. Innovative late movers are advantaged asymmetrically in that their diffusion can hurt the sales of other brands, but their sales are not affected by competitors' diffusion. In contrast, noninnovative late movers face smaller potential markets, lower repeat rates, and less marketing effectiveness compared with the pioneer.

TI An anchoring and adjustment model of purchase quantity decisions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB How do consumers decide how many units to buy? Whereas prior research on individual consumers' purchases has focused primarily on purchase incidence and brand choice, the authors focus on the psychological process behind the purchase quantity decision. The authors propose that a simple anchoring and adjustment model describes how consumers make purchase quantity decisions and suggests how point-of-purchase promotions can increase sales. Two field experiments and two lab studies show that anchor-based promotions-presented as multiple-unit prices, purchase quantity limits, and suggestive selling-can increase purchase quantities. The final study shows that consumers who retrieve internal anchors can counter these anchor-based promotions effectively. Firms might receive net benefits from anchor-based promotions depending on whether increases in unit sales reflect increased category consumption, brand switching, variety switching, store switching, or stockpiling.

TI Market-level effects of information: Competitive responses and consumer
   dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Information flowing into a market from firms can stimulate competitive activity and consumer dynamics that ultimately improve the functioning of that market (e.g., improve product quality), However, prior research has provided limited empirical evidence regarding the conditions under which (1) information confers such benefits on the market, (2) firms make strategic use of such information flows, and (3) consumer behavior influences the achievement of these market effects and strategic benefits, The author performs a longitudinal quasi-experiment to investigate these issues using the introduction of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) as a research context. Results indicate that information did promote consumer dynamics that may have fostered competitive activity among firms. Specifically, marketers changed the quality of base brands and their brand extensions in unique and opposite ways that enabled brands to occupy distinct strategic positions in the market. Market information also influenced the nature of competitive rivalry by shifting price promotion levels depending on the healthy positioning of firm brands. Such approaches were speculated to provide firms with a means of coping with the uncertainty of competitive and consumer reactions to the NLEA, extending theories of the market-level effects of information to include the strategic use of such information by firms.

TI A relationship between market share elasticities and brand switching
   probabilities
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors derive a theoretical relationship between the aggregate market share elasticity matrix and the aggregate brand switching matrix on the basis of a logit model of heterogeneous consumers choosing among competing brands in a product class. Aggregate cross-elasticities are shown to be proportional (through a single scaling constant) to their corresponding aggregate row-conditional brand switching probabilities. Aggregate own-elasticities are shown to be proportional (through the negative of the same scaling constant) to one minus their corresponding aggregate row-conditional repeat purchase probabilities. An empirical analysis conducted on household scanner panel data in the liquid laundry detergent category shows that the theoretical correspondence holds as a very good approximation. An illustrative use of the relationship in estimating aggregate (store-level) models of market share indicates that the relationship helps improve predictive validity in a holdout period.

TI A meta-analysis of relationships between ad-evoked feelings and
   advertising responses
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors conduct meta-analyses of relationships involving positive and negative ad-evoked feelings to determine (1) whether the effects of positive and negative feelings on advertising responses are symmetrical or asymmetrical and bipolar or bidimensional; (2) whether study design characteristics influence the strength of effects of positive and negative feelings on ad and brand attitudes; (3) whether moderator effects are differential for positive and negative feelings; and (4) whether relationships are generalizable across different study designs, product types, and media. Using the aggregated data, the authors assess competing predictions of three alternative theoretical perspectives: bipolarity, generalized asymmetry, and contingent asymmetry, Analyses indicate that positive and negative feelings have contingently asymmetrical effects on advertising responses, Study conditions related to subjects' cognitive processing sets moderated the effects of negative feelings on ad and brand attitudes but generally did not moderate the effects of positive feelings, The authors also demonstrate the utility of bootstrapping as an advantageous new way of conducting moderator analyses in meta-analysis.

TI Distance representations of consumer perceptions: Evaluating
   appropriateness by using diagnostics
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB To understand consumer perceptions of product/market structures, marketers must choose from a wide variety of spatial and tree models. Because spatial and tree representations in general possess different distance patterns, diagnostic measures calculated from the input data of dissimilarities or similarities should be able to indicate how appropriate a certain type of representation might be for a given set of input data. In this article, the author draws from previous literature on the characteristics of diagnostic measures and representation models to develop some partial hypotheses about how well the measures might indicate the appropriateness (in terms of fit) of different models. Empirical analysis indicates that the skewness diagnostic is clearly the best predictor of the appropriateness of representation models; this finding is consistent across a variety of comparable spatial and tree models. Centrality and the reciprocity-related measure, in conjunction with skewness, are useful for specific types of space-tree pairs. The author uses the U-Method (closely related to jackknifing) of prediction, in conjunction with discriminant analysis models, to show that the diagnostics can predict the relative appropriateness of spaces versus trees with accuracy levels substantially greater than what would be expected by chance.

TI How brand names affect the demand for twin automobiles
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the author considers the effect of brand names on demand by examining the price ratios of used twin automobiles. Twins usually are made in the same plant and have essentially the same physical attributes but different brand names. If the models of a twin pair are perceived as perfect substitutes, their relative price should equal unity. Brand names could cause the demand for twin models to differ if consumers use the brand names to make inferences about unobservable quality. Consumers also might prefer one brand to another for prestige or status. The relative prices of most of the twin pairs in the sample differ from unity, which implies that consumers do not perceive the twin models to be perfect substitutes. Parent-brand quality and other brand factors are related to the relative prices of the twin pairs. The results suggest that consumers rely on information about the parent brand to make inferences about individual products that carry the parent name. The results have implications for firms' branding policies.

TI Consumers' perceptions of the assortment offered in a grocery category:
   The impact of item reduction
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Grocery retailers have been informed that, to remain competitive, they must reduce the number of stockkeeping units (SKUs) offered, in line with consumer demand, or, in other words, adopt "Efficient Assortment." Retailers have resisted this principle on the basis of a fear that eliminating items would lower consumer assortment perceptions and decrease the likelihood of store choice. In two studies, the authors examine how consumers form assortment perceptions in the face of SKU reduction with a particular emphasis on two heuristic cues: the availability of a favorite product and the amount of shelf space devoted to the category. Results indicate that retailers might be able to make substantive reductions in the number of items carried without negatively affecting assortment perceptions and store choice, as long as only low-preference items are eliminated and category space is held constant. Thus, the potential risk inherent in item reduction might be more limited than initially thought. The authors then discuss the implications of these findings for retailers, as well as additional measurement considerations.

TI Investigating consumers' tendency to combine multiple shopping purposes
   and destinations
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Because of the increasing time pressure they face, many consumers are becoming more concerned about the efficiency of their shopping patterns. Retailers have recognized this trend and have improved shopping convenience by offering greater variety in product categories and making it easier for consumers to combine visits to multiple stores. However, little is known about how consumers improve the efficiency of their shopping trips or how changes in retail supply affect the way in which consumers combine multiple purposes and destinations. Building on previous work in consumer shopping trip modeling and conjoint design theory, the authors introduce a choice-based conjoint approach to studying and modeling this phenomenon. The authors illustrate the approach in a case study that investigates the tendency of Dutch shoppers to combine grocery, drugstore, and clothing purchases across multiple shopping destinations. The authors observe that the tendency of consumers to combine purchases differs from category to category and depends on category availability. In general, consumers combine considerably fewer purchases than could be expected if their shopping trip planning was based purely on travel cost minimization.

TI Determining segmentation in sales response across consumer purchase
   behaviors
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop a joint estimation approach to segment households on the basis of their response to price and promotion in brand choice, purchase incidence, and purchase quantity decisions. The authors model brand choice (what to buy) by multinomial legit, incidence (whether to buy) by nested legit, and quantity (how much to buy) by poisson regression. Response segments are determined probabilistically using a latent mixture model. The approach simultaneously calibrates sales response on two dimensions: across segments and the three purchase behaviors. The procedure permits market-level sales elasticities to be decomposed by segment and purchase behavior (i.e., choice, incidence, and quantity). The authors apply the approach to scanner panel data for the yogurt category and find substantial differences across segments in the relative impact of the choice, incidence, and quantity decisions on overall sales response to price.

TI Simulation experiments in choice simplification: The effects of task and
   context on forecasting performance
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Experimental and protocol-based research has demonstrated convincingly that consumers frequently use simplification heuristics prior to making choices. Consequently, quantitative choice models incorporating simplification strategies recently have received much research attention. Given the additional computational cost and complexity involved in estimating these models, the authors investigate how robustly the standard legit model accommodates choice simplification processes. The results show that when consumers screen brands using an elimination-by-aspects strategy, legit forecasts choices reasonably well, but the parameter estimates are severely biased. However, when consumers screen through brands previously purchased, augmented by brands promoted, legit both forecasts poorly and produces biased parameter estimates, even when dedicated screening variables are included in the legit utility function. The predictive validity of legit improves somewhat when the universal set size is small and when purchase event feedback is less important.

The authors note that advertising has different goals, depending on the competitive context of the brand, with some advertisers positioned to differentiate between brands and others positioned to narrow the perceived difference between brands. The authors identify specific types of nonprice advertising positioning that increase brand equity and category price sensitivity, those that decrease both, and those that increase brand equity while increasing category price sensitivity. The hypotheses are tested in two experiments across different product categories. The results imply that tests of advertising effectiveness must extend beyond brand attitudinal measures.

TI Interdependence, punitive capability, and the reciprocation of punitive
   actions in channel relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Using data from automobile dealers in the Netherlands, the authors find that dealers' punitive actions toward their key suppliers are affected by their perceptions of their own and their supplier's interdependence and punitive capabilities, as well as by the supplier's punitive actions. Punitive actions are affected by interdependence, but a more complete picture is achieved by also examining punitive capability. The authors test hypotheses based on bilateral deterrence, conflict spiral, and relative power theories, but none of these comprehensively explains the effects of both total power and power asymmetry. Dealer punitive actions are inhibited as total interdependence increases, but are promoted as total punitive capability increases. Using spline regression, the authors find that interdependence asymmetry has no direct effect on punitive actions, whereas punitive capability asymmetry does. As dealers' punitive capability advantage as compared with their suppliers' increases, dealers make greater use of punitive actions, whereas they use fewer punitive actions as their punitive capability deficit increases. The authors also find that dealers with a relative advantage in dependence or punitive capability are more likely to reciprocate their supplier's punitive actions.

This latent structure, ordered probit, multidimensional scaling (MDS) based methodology improves on existing industry techniques of illustrating perceived customer value because it enables researchers to infer the underlying dimensions of perceived value from the data without specifying these a priori, as is common in existing methods.

Finally, the authors discuss managerial implications of this technique and provide directions for further research.

TI The long-term impact of promotions on consumer stockpiling behavior
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although brands have increased their promotional spending substantially in many categories over the past decade, panel-based research into consumer stockpiling behavior typically has assumed that consumers' decisions regarding whether and how much to purchase have remained invariant to this increase. The authors develop a varying parameter model of purchase incidence and purchase quantity to ascertain whether this increase in promotions has affected households' stockpiling decisions in the long term. The authors estimate the model on the basis of more than eight years of panel data for a frequently purchased, nonfood, consumer packaged-goods product. The results suggest that consumers' stockpiling behavior has changed over the years. The increased long-term exposure of households to promotions has reduced their likelihood of making category purchases on subsequent shopping trips. However, when households do decide to buy, they tend to buy more of a good. Such behavior is indicative of an increasing tendency to "lie in wait" for especially good promotions. This change appears to have some deleterious ramifications for category profitability.

TI Learning and performance orientation of salespeople: The role of
   supervisors
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The recent work of Sujan, Weitz, and Kumar (1994) brings into sharp focus two distinct goal orientations of salespeople: learning and performance. In this article, the authors make two primary contributions to this emerging topic in salesforce literature: (1) They develop and examine novel propositions that shed light on how supervisors influence the goal orientations of salespeople, and (2) They examine whether supervisors' influence on their salespeople's orientations is moderated by salesperson experience. The article's hypotheses are tested using data from salespeople in two Fortune 500 companies. The results support several of the a priori hypotheses and suggest that supervisory behaviors las perceived by salespeople) have a significant influence on salespeople's learning and performance orientations. Furthermore, the authors obtain some support for the hypothesized moderating effect of salesperson experience.

TI Information asymmetry and levels of agency relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Many marketing exchanges are characterized by an information asymmetry between suppliers and customers. Specifically, customers are faced with both adverse selection and moral hazard problems that involve, respectively, uncertainty about supplier characteristics and the risk of quality cheating. Drawing on prior research, the authors propose that agency problems in a customer relationship can be resolved by means of customer bonds and price premiums, which serve as signals and supplier incentives, respectively. The authors also propose that adverse selection and moral hazard problems exist in relationships between suppliers and their employees. Similar to the customer relationship, these problems can be addressed with signals and incentives of various kinds. The authors present hypotheses regarding the agency problems in both of these relationships and test them empirically in the context of automotive service purchases. Data obtained from 287 service managers support the hypotheses. The data also suggest that institutional differences across service outlets (e.g., ownership structure and size) influence how the two types of agency problems are managed.

TI Seasonal marketing and timing new product introductions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Virtually every product is seasonal; seasonality often dictates business strategy. In this article, the authors (1) show how to add known seasonal patterns to any dynamic model parsimoniously and without changing the fundamental model assumptions, (2) illustrate how their method provides strategic implications for timing new product introductions, and (3) provide an empirical application. The authors transform time so that, during high seasons, time is moving faster than normal time. Traditional methods only adjust sales, independent of the underlying sales model. The authors' method also changes the product's growth along its life cycle and suggests that timing introduction decisions are dependent on the shape of the product's life cycle. The authors' empirical work compares their theoretical results with empirical observations. With data for ail major films released between July 1993 and 1995 (673 films), the authors estimate the seasonal pattern for the motion picture industry and compare their theory with studio behavior.

TI Consumer processing of product trial and the influence of prior
   advertising: A structural modeling approach
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB A major goal of this study is to develop and test a structural model of trial processing to help marketers and researchers better understand the dynamics of this important stage in the purchase process. No such model exists, even though prior research has demonstrated that product trial can be an important determinant of brand beliefs and attitudes. Accordingly, the authors develop a general model of how consumers process and respond to trial experiences. This trial model then is integrated with a well-known advertising model to trace how (1) consumers react when both types of information are available and (2) advertising achieves its influence on trial perceptions. The authors estimate these models for two products that vary significantly in the diagnosticity of the trial experience and discuss implications for marketing research and practice.

TI An empirical analysis of umbrella branding
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the author studies the processes by which consumers' quality perceptions of a brand in a product category are affected by their experience with the same brand in a different category. The model proposed and estimated explicitly incorporates some of the basic consumer behavior premises of signaling theory of umbrella branding (Montgomery and Wernerfelt 1992; Wernerfelt 1988), The author provides a framework to analyze the impact of marketing mix strategies in one product category on quality perceptions, consumer perceived risk, and consumer choice behavior in a different category. The model is estimated on panel data for two oral hygiene products, toothpaste and toothbrushes, in which a subset of brands share the same brand name across the two product categories. The results show strong support for the consumer premises of the signaling theory of umbrella branding.

TI Determining where to shop: Fixed and variable costs of shopping
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop and test a new model of store choice behavior whose basic premise is that each shopper is more likely to visit the store with the lowest total shopping cost. The total shopping cost is composed of fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost is independent of, whereas the variable cost depends on, the shopping list (i.e., the products and their respective quantities to be purchased), Besides travel distance, the fixed cost includes a shopper's inherent preference for the store and historic store loyalty, The variable cost is a weighted sum of the quantities of items on the shopping list multiplied by their expected prices at the store. The article has three objectives: (1) to model and estimate the relative importance of fixed and variable shopping costs, (2) to investigate customer segmentation in response to shopping costs, and (3) to introduce a new measure (the basket size threshold) that defines competition between stores from a shopping cost perspective. The model controls for two important phenomena: Consumer shopping lists might differ from the collection of goods ultimately bought, and shoppers might develop category-specific store loyalty.

TI Exploring the determinants of Broadway show success
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB This study investigates the determinants of success of an experiential good: Broadway shows. The authors focus on the sources and types of information used in the selection of an artistic event and discuss the impact of critics' reviews on the length of a show's run and attendance. In addition, the authors empirically determine the influence of other variables, such as previews, newspaper advertising, ticket prices, show type, talent characteristics, and timing of opening. The results indicate that New York newspaper theater critics have a significant impact on the success of Broadway shows. It is also found that the newspaper critics have a differential impact, with the critic from the New York Times yielding nearly twice as much influence as critics from the Daily News or the New York Post. Theater critics, it appears, are not only predictors but influencers as well. Among the various show types, musicals appear to fare better than other categories of shows. Previews have a significant impact on the attendance, but not on the longevity, of Broadway shows. Advertising also has a significant impact on both longevity and attendance. However, the characteristics of the key talent do not have a consistently significant influence on show success. In addition, ticket prices do not have a significant relationship with either longevity or attendance. The results indicate that there is an overwhelming impact of information sources, particularly the influence of critics' reviews, on the success of Broadway shows. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the theater industry.

TI On the heterogeneity of demand
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Demand heterogeneity traditionally has been defined as segments of consumers that are homogeneous with regard to the benefits they seek or in their response to marketing programs (e.g., product offering, price discounts). Although it often is acknowledged that truly homogeneous segments of consumers do not exist, the approximation is assumed to be sufficiently accurate to provide a reasonable basis for the development of marketing strategy. In this article, the authors provide evidence that the homogeneous segment assumption might not be reasonable. By using a normal component mixture model that nests other, more commonly used models of heterogeneity, the authors find that the within-component heterogeneity remains substantial, even when multiple components are present, Predictive tests substantiate their finding of large within-component heterogeneity.

TI The effect of promotion on consumption: Buying more and consuming it
   faster
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors empirically demonstrate the existence of flexible consumption rates in packaged-goods products, how this phenomenon can be modeled, and its importance in assessing the effectiveness of sales promotion. They specify an incidence, choice, and quantity model in which category consumption varies with the level of household inventory. The authors use two different functions to relate consumption rates to household inventory and estimate the models using scanner panel data from two product categories: yogurt and ketchup, Both functions provide a significantly better fit than a conventional model, which assumes a constant daily usage rate. They also have strong discriminant validity; yogurt consumption is found to be much more flexible with respect to inventory than ketchup consumption is. The authors use a Monte Carte simulation to decompose the long-term impact of promotion into brand switching and consumption effects and conclude with the implications of their findings for researchers and managers.

TI Advertising frequency decisions in a discrete Markov process under a
   budget constraint
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author studies the optimality of advertising pulsing under the assumption that demand follows a discrete and interpretable Markov process and that the advertising budget is constrained. The author develops two main results. First, when pulsing is optimal, the prevalence of advertising effects on switching or repurchasing affects the length of the pulse (shorter versus longer, respectively), as well as the optimal level of advertising. Second, the author identifies the functional forms of the short- and long-term effects of advertising in the discrete Markov process and shows that pulsing can be optimal if the transition probabilities are concave in advertising. As an alternative to a pure Markov carryover (if any), the author considers that carryover effects of advertising also might be caused by accumulation of memory for the advertisement. Although general results are difficult to obtain, the author analyzes one case of the compound dynamics of the Markov process and memory effects for advertising with results similar to the pure Markov process. Similarities and differences with continuous-time models, as well as managerial implications, are discussed.

TI Overcoming the early entrant advantage: The role of alignable and
   nonalignable differences
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Prior research has focused On early entrant advantage rather than on theories that explain and predict how late entrants can surpass the early entrant's performance. In this research, the authors propose that learning about new brands is influenced by the way the attributes of later entrants compare with attributes of the first. In three experiments, the authors show that attributes that differentiate later entrants from the first entrant are better remembered and listed more often in judgment formation protocols if the attributes are comparable along some common aspect (i.e., they are alignable differences) than if they do not correspond to any attributes of the first entrant (i.e., they are nonalignable differences). The impact of greater memorability of alignable over nonalignable differences is that later entrants whose attributes are superior to those of the first entrant can come to be preferred over the first entrant when the attributes are alignable differences but not when they are nonalignable differences. These findings have important implications for product entry, differentiation, and positioning strategies.

TI The illusion of delayed incentives: Evaluating future effort-money
   transactions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In many real-world situations, consumers must evaluate future transaction opportunities in which money will be awarded for the performance of effort or for providing a service. In a marketing setting, consumers often are promised a delayed reward, contingent on the performance of future effort. In such situations, the author proposes that at the time of brand choice, the future effort is underweighted, relative to the future savings. Consequently,an incentive that appears attractive at the time of brand choice may appear unattractive at the time of redemption. The author hypothesizes and experimentally demonstrates the effect of face value, level of effort, and temporal delay on choice, redemption, and profits. Results show that temporal delay between choice and redemption causes a systematic underweighting of future effort, which mediates the increased attractiveness of alternatives with delayed incentives. The author also uses an analytical model to derive the profitability implications of delayed incentives.

TI Predecisional distortion of product information
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Two consumer choice experiments reveal distortion of product information. When relatively equivocal information about two hypothetical brands is acquired one attribute at a time, the evaluation of a subsequent attribute is distorted to support the brand that emerges as the leader. This distortion in favor of the leading brand occurs in the absence of any prior brand preference and even when no choice is required. in the latter case, brand preference is formed spontaneously and privately. The magnitude of this predecisional information distortion is roughly double the well-known postdecisional distortion due to cognitive dissonance. A second study shows that, even when the product information is diagnostic, substantial distortion remains. Furthermore, when the diagnostic information leads to a reversal of the currently preferred brand, distortion reappears in support of the new leading brand. The implications of predecisional distortion of product information are discussed for the presentation order of brands, the presentation format of product attributes, and the potential bias in preference assessment techniques, such as conjoint measurement, that rely on pairwise choices.

TI Divide and prosper: Consumers' reactions to partitioned prices
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Many firms divide a product's price into two mandatory parts, such as the base price of a mail-order shirt and the surcharge for shipping and handling, rather than charging a combined, all-inclusive price, The authors call this strategy partitioned pricing. Although firms presumably use partitioned pricing to increase demand and profits, there is little clear empirical support that these prices increase demand or any theoretical explanation for why this should occur. The authors test hypotheses of how consumers process partitioned prices and how partitioned pricing affects consumers' processing and recall of total costs and their purchase intentions and certain types of demand. The results suggest that partitioned prices decrease consumers' recalled total costs and increase their demand. The manner in which the surcharge is presented and consumers' affect for the brand name also influence how they react to partitioned prices.

TI The effects of extensions on brand name dilution and enhancement
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors examine new product extension strategies that are likely to be effective in building brand equity. The framework accounts for mixed findings in brand equity literature by identifying motivation as a factor that moderates the dilution and enhancement effects observed in prior research. The authors find that the typicality of the extension and consumers' level of motivation determine the effect of extensions on family brand name. In high-motivation conditions, incongruent extensions are scrutinized in detail and lead to the modification of family brand evaluations, regardless of the typicality of the extensions. However, in low-motivation conditions, brand evaluations are more extreme in the context of high (versus low) typicality. The less typical extension is considered an exception, which reduces its impact on evaluations. Results also show that brand name dilution or enhancement can occur in response to congruent extensions. However, processes that underlie the effect of congruent information are somewhat different.

TI Organizing for radical product innovation: The overlooked role of
   willingness to cannibalize
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Why are some firms more successful at introducing radical product innovations than others? Following Schumpeter (1942), many researchers have suggested that firm size is the key organizational predictor of radical product innovation. The authors provide an alternate view and argue that one key variable that differentiates firms with strong radical product innovation records from others is the firms' willingness to cannibalize their own investments. The authors identify three organizational factors that drive a firm's willingness to cannibalize. Results from a survey of three high-tech industries tend to support the alternate view that willingness to cannibalize is a more powerful driver of radical product innovation than firm size is. These results suggest a need to reconsider conventional wisdom on firm size, cannibalization, and organizational synergy.

TI When is it worthwhile targeting the majority instead of the innovators
   in a new product launch?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Despite the relatively small number of Innovators in a potential market for a new product, they are often the main target of a firm's marketing efforts. Because the innovators tend to influence the remaining potential adopters, that is, the Majority, firms tend to allocate more marketing efforts and resources toward the Innovators than toward the Majority. Using a two-stage game model with a diffusion effect, the authors analytically investigate whether this is always an optimal strategy. They identify several market and competitive conditions in which it might be optimal for firms to target the Majority rather than the Innovators. The managerial implications of these conditions for new product launch are discussed.

AB Generalized knowledge comes from cumulating results across studies, a process known as meta-analysis. Efficiently increasing generalized knowledge in a defined area-estimates of price or advertising, for example-is one important goal for research. Because (I) most meta-analyses are based on highly inefficient and unbalanced natural experiments or designs and (2) additional studies are costly, carefully selecting the next study is important. The authors demonstrate that, rather than simply selecting a study that uses currently underrepresented design variables, a procedure that reduces collinearity among design variables will produce far superior improvements in knowledge.

TI International market segmentation based on consumer-product relations
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB With increasing competition in the global marketplace, international segmentation has become an ever more important issue in developing, positioning, and selling products across national borders. The authors propose a methodology to identify cross-national market segments, based on means-end chain theory. The methodology offers the potential for integrating product development and communication strategies by linking product characteristics to consumer benefits and values. For that purpose, a model is developed that identifies relations between the consumer and the product at the segment level, which increases the actionability and responsiveness of the segments. The model accounts for different response tendencies, across and within countries, that commonly hamper identification of cross-national segments. A Monte Carlo study shows that the model performs well in recovering the parameters across a wide range of conditions, The segmentation model is applied to consumer data on yogurt collected in 11 countries of the European Union. Four international segments are identified and found to be related to consumer sociodemographics, consumption patterns, media consumption, and personality, The authors show that the model has high predictive validity and outperforms the standard clustering approaches traditionally employed in international segmentation.

TI The use of visual mental imagery in new product design
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this research, the authors seek to advance the understanding of how marketing can facilitate the new product design process. They focus on how designers' use of a specific cognitive process, visual mental imagery, can influence the customer appeal of a design. The authors present a conceptual framework for examining how visual imagery might influence the customer appeal of a design output. This is followed by two experiments that test the hypotheses that flow from the proposed model. The experiments manipulate the type of visual imagery used and the incorporation of the customer in the imagery invoked and then examine its effects on the usefulness, originality, and customer appeal of the resulting design. Consistent with the framework and the proposed hypotheses, the findings show that including the customer in imagination visual imagery during the design process has a greater effect on the usefulness of the design produced than including the customer in memory visual imagery. The results also show that imagery based on imagination results in more original designs than imagery based on memory. Most important, the use of bounded imagination, which results from the incorporation of the visual images of the customer in imagination imagery, leads to the creation of designs that are more appealing to the customer. The findings are integrated into a discussion that clarifies the role of visual imagery in design and underscores the potential of this cognitive tool in the new product design process.

TI Making complementary choices in consumption episodes: Highlighting
   versus balancing
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although most research on consumer decision making has focused on individual choices, the majority of products are purchased and consumed with other products (e.g., an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert) as part of the same purchase and/or consumption episode (e.g., a meal), The authors investigate consumption episode effects, whereby the attribute levels of one component affect the chosen levels of another component (e.g., the effect of consuming a tasty, unhealthy entree on the experience and likelihood of choosing a tasty, unhealthy dessert). Building on a distinction between goals and resources, the authors propose that (1) in episodes involving a tradeoff between a goal (e.g., pleasure) and a resource (e.g., money), consumers tend to highlight either goal fulfillment or resource conservation by selecting similar attribute levels for items consumed in the same episode (e.g., a tasty, expensive appetizer and a tasty, expensive entree on one occasion and less tasty, less expensive items on another occasion) and (2) if each choice involves a tradeoff between two goals (e.g., pleasure and good health), consumers tend to balance attribute levels (e.g., in each episode have one tasty item and one healthy item). These predictions are supported in a series of studies, with a total of approximately 2650 respondents, that also examined rival explanations and the boundaries of consumption episode effects. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

TI The malleable self: The role of self-expression in persuasion
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Considerable research in consumer experimental psychology has examined the self-expressive role of brands but has found little support for the premise that the interaction of the personality traits associated with a brand and those associated with an individual's self-concept influence attitudes. The current research focuses on the influence of the malleable self-concept on consumer attitudes toward a brand, based on the its personality associations. The results of two experiments demonstrate that traits that are made accessible by salient situational cues and those that are chronically accessible (schematic traits) positively influence consumer attitudes toward a brand based on its personality associations. More important, these effects are tested in a set of theory-based interactions that rely on the self-monitoring individual difference variable. Self congruity is enhanced for low versus high self-monitoring subjects, whereas situation congruity is enhanced for high versus low self-monitoring subjects. Together, these experiments shed light on the self-expressive use of brands and the role of the malleable self-concept in influencing consumer attitudes.

TI How and when factual ad claims mislead consumers: Examining the
   deceptive consequences of copy x copy interactions for partial
   comparative advertisements
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The current research considers how ad claims that are factual may mislead consumers. This possibility is examined in the context of advertisements that present a combination of comparative and noncomparative information. In particular, the authors explore how and when processing of the former type of ad information can cause deceptive beliefs about the latter type of ad information, an outcome referred to as "copy x copy" interactions. The authors examine alternative processes that may underlie copy x copy interactions, as well as when these interactions are most likely to occur by testing their robustness across potential moderators. The authors also provide evidence regarding the magnitude and seriousness of copy x copy interactions and present implications for public policy and directions for additional research.

TI Understanding how product attributes influence product categorization:
   Development and validation of fuzzy set-based measures of gradedness in
   product categories
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Products vary in the degree to which they are members of product categories. Understanding how product attributes influence product categorization is important for marketing decisions about product development, brand extension, and product positioning. Existing attribute-level measures of product attitude emphasize evaluation rather than categorization. Measures of category membership either are at the overall product level or emphasize feature-based attributes, whereas product attributes are often continuous in nature. A comprehensive approach for conceptualizing product categorization is provided by fuzzy set theory, with its basic postulate that no clear boundaries exist between members and nonmembers of a fuzzy set. The authors conceptualize product categories as fuzzy sets in which products have degrees of membership along specific attributes, argued to arise as a result of the degree to which a product possesses an attribute. Two fuzzy set-based measures of category membership are developed that assess gradedness of category membership at the attribute level, which is then combined across attributes to reach overall measures of gradedness for a product. The results of a study demonstrate the validity of these measures and illustrate important attribute-level analyses that are not possible with existing approaches.

TI Market motives, distinctive capabilities, and domestic inertia: A hybrid
   model of innovation generation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop and test a model of innovation in which the generative process of innovation is fostered by a balance of three forces: market motives, distinctive capabilities, and domestic inertia. The authors distinguish between potential and realized competition and, focusing on interinnovation duration as the dependent variable, develop hypotheses to capture the effects of competition, feedback from the marketplace, and product characteristics on innovation dynamics. Weekly diffusion and innovation data for 11 computer software products available on the Internet, involving more than 100 new versions in the period 1991 to 1994, are used to test the hypotheses. Model comparison tests provide strong support for the hybrid model over models based on restricted conceptualizations. Domestic inertia considerations explain 45% of the variance in interinnovation duration, and market motives and distinctive capabilities explain 33% and 22%, respectively. The authors support the expectation of a U-shaped effect of potential competition and find that realized competition increases interinnovation duration. Products that are more customer-driven witness faster innovation, and the diffusion rate of a current innovation plays a significant role in future innovative activities: It moderates the effect of potential competition and interacts with product bundling to delay innovation. Furthermore, the authors find that product bundling per se does not influence innovation activities and that, when a product is enjoying a high rate of diffusion, competition does not hasten the arrival of innovations.

TI In search of diversity: The record of major marketing journals
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors analyze the publications of four major marketing journals on the basis of their diversity relative to each other, against their mission statements, and over time. One important finding is that the journals that make no claim to diversity tend to be quite diverse, while the one that strives to be diverse does not seem to achieve its goal. A second major finding is that each of the four journals has a distinct character that is not necessarily the one intended by its mission or its editors. A third major finding is that these patterns are generally stable over time and tend to persist even in the face of efforts and pleas by its editors for change.

TI The dark side of long-term relationships in marketing services
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In their study of marketing services relationships, Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande (1992) are unable to support a hypothesized link between relational factors (such as clients' trust in their service providers) and clients' use of marketing services. This finding runs counter to relationship marketing theory. To explain their result, Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande (1992) suggest that, as a relationship becomes more longterm, it becomes prone to negative influences that dampen the positive impact of relational factors. This study replicates and extends Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpande's (1992) work by examining relationships between advertising agencies and their clients. The results replicate findings on seven of ten hypotheses proposed in the original article. The authors also extend the original study by supporting the general hypothesis that long-term relationships have a negative impact on service use, which dampens the impact of trust. The results shed light on the mediating role that certain "dark side" constructs play in marketing services relationships.

TI Emotional trade-off difficulty and choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors explore whether choice patterns are sensitive to the potential of relevant trade-offs to elicit negative emotion. Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects' relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naive subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992).

TI An empirical investigation of ex post transaction costs in franchised
   distribution channels

AB This study focuses on organizational efforts to constrain ex post transaction costs in interorganizational exchange. The theoretical model frames opportunism as a determinant of transaction costs and implicates cooperation and formalization as control structures that alleviate opportunism. The model also examines whether the proposed theoretical relationships are enduring. Franchisee-franchisor relationships in the Norwegian distribution system of a multinational oil refiner provide the context for analysis. A test of the model using multisample data across two time periods indicates that opportunistic behavior consistently increases transaction costs. Furthermore, cooperative interaction curbs bargaining costs, and formalization reduces opportunism. The authors discuss implications for interorganizational theory and franchising management.

TI A dynamic model of customers' usage of services: Usage as an antecedent
   and consequence of satisfaction
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB As firms seek ways to manage customer relationships over the long term, understanding the dynamics of the service provider-customer relationship becomes a key priority. In this article, the authors develop and test a dynamic model of customer usage of services, identifying causal links between customer's prior usage levels, satisfaction evaluations, and subsequent service usage. The authors quantify the (heretofore anecdotal) relationship between customer satisfaction and subsequent service usage and provide new theoretical insights into the antecedents of customer satisfaction by introducing the concept of perceived payment equity. The primary contribution of the article is an understanding of how service usage changes over time, and particularly, how the consumer's view of the fairness or "equity" of the exchange over time affects the consumer's usage of services. Specifically, payment equity represents the customer's changing evaluation of the fairness of the level of economic benefits derived from usage in relation to the level of economic costs, that is, the customer's evaluation of the fairness of the exchange. By examining the antecedents of payment equity, it can be determined how customers use price and usage over time to update their evaluations of the fairness of the exchange. This evaluation affects overall satisfaction, which in turn affects future usage. The results suggest that customers' usage levels can be managed through pricing strategies, more generally dynamic customer satisfaction management.

TI Perceptions of price unfairness: Antecedents and consequences
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Using two studies, the author examines the influence of the inferred motive for a firm's price increase on perceptions of price unfairness. Prior to the research presented here, the only established causal antecedent of perceived price unfairness was increased relative profit. In Study 1,the author extends the existing research by demonstrating that the inferred motive, as well as inferred relative profit, provides causal explanation of perceived price unfairness. When participants inferred that the firm had a negative motive for a price increase, the increase was perceived as significantly less fair than the same increase when participants inferred that the firm had a positive motive. In addition, the author shows in Study 2 that the firm's reputation can influence the inferred motive, thereby altering perceptions of price unfairness. Specifically, participants sometimes gave a firm with a good reputation the benefit of the doubt when inferring motive. If the "good" firm did not profit from the price increase, participants inferred significantly more positive motives than if it did profit. The firm with a poor reputation did not receive this benefit; inferred motive was equally negative regardless of whether the firm profited from the price increase. Together, these studies provide evidence that consumer inferences of the motive for a price increase influence the perceived fairness of the increase. Furthermore, reputation is shown to moderate the effect of inferred relative profit on inferred motive. Finally, analyses show that perceived unfairness leads to lower shopping intentions and demonstrate that perceived unfairness mediates the effects of inferred motive and relative price on consumers' shopping intentions.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB New product ideation might be improved by identifying and applying certain well-defined schemes derived from an historical analysis of product-based trends, termed "templates." These templates might contribute to the understanding and prediction of new product emergence. The authors derive templates in a study that maps the evolution of product changes by adapting a set of intrinsic operations originally designed to uncover hidden logical patterns in technological inventions. They find that the majority of new product versions can be accounted for by as few as five templates, The authors define the five templates and show that they derive from six elementary (first principle) operators. A procedure for using the dominant template, termed "Attribute Dependency," is outlined, followed by a report of two experiments examining its usefulness in the context of product ideation.

TI When do price promotions affect pretrial brand evaluations?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate the conditions in which price promotions affect pretrial brand evaluations. A price promotion is theorized to be informative about brand quality when it stands out because it deviates from either its own past behavior or industry norms. Product category experts, who have alternative sources of information to make quality judgments, are expected to make less use of price promotions as a quality cue than novices are. The authors describe three laboratory studies in the context of a price promotion that is designed to increase trial in a service industry. Results suggest that consistency with past promotional behavior, distinctiveness in terms of how common it is to promote in an industry, and consumer expertise are important variables that moderate when price promotions have an unfavorable effect on brand evaluations. The authors highlight implications for service providers that are offering promotions to attract new customers in industries in which promotions are uncommon and discuss the theoretical implications of the finding that expertise moderates the effects of distinctiveness and consistency on evaluations in the context of price promotions.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors advance a conceptual model of channel member satisfaction that distinguishes between economic and noneconomic satisfaction. The resulting model then is tested using meta-analysis, Meta-analysis enables the empirical investigation of a model involving several constructs that never have been examined simultaneously within an individual study. More specifically, the authors unify the stream of research on power use-the focus of many satisfaction studies in the 1970s and 1980s-with more recent work on trust and commitment, which usually explores antecedents other than power use. The results indicate that economic satisfaction and noneconomic satisfaction are distinct constructs with differential relationships to various antecedents and consequences. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that satisfaction is both conceptually and empirically separable from the related constructs of trust and commitment.

TI The contingency value of complementary capabilities in product
   development
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Current interdisciplinary research suggests that organizational capabilities have a direct, unconditional impact on firm performance. The authors extend this literature by developing a framework that proposes a contingency approach to the value of organizational capabilities. This framework highlights the effect of information in the external environment in stimulating firms to deploy their technology and marketing capabilities to influence the level and speed of relevant product development activities. Using a longitudinal quasiexperiment to isolate the effects of external information on the relationship between firm capabilities and product development outcomes, the authors obtain results that are consistent with this framework. The authors therefore conclude that the most valuable characteristic of firm capabilities may be their ability to serve as flexible strategic options. In this role, firms can deploy them in ways consistent with environmental forces.

TI Signaling unobservable product quality through a brand ally
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors examine the circumstances in which brand names convey information about unobservable quality. They argue that a brand name can convey unobservable quality credibly when false claims will result in intolerable economic losses, These losses can occur for two reasons: (1) losses of reputation or sunk investments and (2) losses of future profits that occur whether or not the brand has a reputation. The authors test this assertion in the context of the emerging practice of brand alliances. Results from several studies are supportive of the premise and suggest that, when evaluating a product that has an important unobservable attribute, consumers' quality perceptions are enhanced when a brand is allied with a second brand that is perceived to be vulnerable to consumer sanctions. The authors discuss the theoretical and substantive implications for the area of brand management.

TI The advantages of entry in the growth stage of the product life cycle:
   An empirical analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors examine how the stage of product life cycle in which a brand enters affects its sales through brand growth and market response, after controlling for the order-of-entry effect and time in market, The authors develop a dynamic brand sales model in which brand growth and market response parameters vary by stage of life cycle entry, namely, by pioneers, growth-stage entrants, and mature-stage entrants. The authors estimate the model using data on 29 brands from six pharmaceutical markets.
   The results reveal advantages associated with entering during the growth stage. Growth-stage entrants reach their asymptotic sales level faster than pioneers or mature-stage entrants, are not hurt by competitor diffusion, and enjoy a higher response to perceived product quality than pioneers and mature-stage entrants. Pioneers reach their asymptotic sales levels more slowly than later entrants, and pioneer's sales, unlike later entrants' sales, are hurt by competitor diffusion over time. On the positive side for pioneers, buyers are most responsive to marketing spending by pioneers. Mature-stage entrants are most disadvantaged; they grow more slowly than growth-stage entrants, have lower response to product quality than growth-stage entrants, and have the lowest response to marketing spending.

TI A comparison of multidimensional scaling methods for perceptual mapping
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Multidimensional scaling has been applied to a wide range of marketing problems, in particular to perceptual mapping based on dissimilarity judgments. The introduction of methods based on the maximum likelihood principle is one of the most important developments. In this article, the authors compare the three available Maximum Likelihood Multidimensional Scaling (MLMDS) methods, namely, MULTISCALE, MAXSCAL, and PROSCAL, and the traditional multidimensional scaling (MDS) method KYST in a Monte Carlo study with 243 synthetic data sets. The MLMDS methods outperform KYST with respect to recovering the perceptual maps. MAXSCAL recovers the true distances between brands somewhat better than MULTISCALE, which is somewhat better than PROSCAL. With regard to distance recovery, the MLMDS methods are quite robust to violations of distributional assumptions. The decision criteria for selecting the number of dimensions are less robust to distributional violations. The results support the use of Consistent Akaike Information Criterion for the selection of the number of dimensions. The authors recommend that dissimilarity judgments be collected on interval scales or on ordinal scales with a substantial number of scale values. The authors discuss implications of the results for the design and analysis of perceptual mapping studies.

That is, the authors show how the nonresponse bias associated with asking people about their prior survey participation can be removed. They propose and validate a simple yet powerful statistical model of survey contact across the U.S. population and of survey response among those contacted. The authors find that survey contact and participation rates are lower than previously assumed and that a small percentage of the population is completing the majority of surveys.

TI Relatedness, prominence, and constructive sponsor identification
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Proper identification of event sponsors is a key concern in sponsorship communication. Although practitioners have assumed that event sponsors are identified primarily through pure recollection, the authors show that sponsor identification involves a substantial degree of construction. Results from three experiments indicate that sponsor identification is biased toward brands that are prominent in the marketplace and semantically related to the event. These biases appear to emanate from constructive processes whereby during identification, respondents use the prominence and relatedness of available brands as heuristics to verify their recollection of event-sponsor associations. The effects of relatedness on sponsor identification seem stronger and more robust than those of prominence, which appears to be invoked only for large events. Both effects are robust across methods of identification assessment though less pronounced when the accuracy threshold is high.

TI Vital dimensions in volume perception: Can the eye fool the stomach?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Given the number of volume judgments made by consumers, for example, deciding which package is larger and by how much, it is surprising that little research pertaining to volume perceptions has been done in marketing. In this article, the authors examine the interplay of expectations based on perceptual inputs versus experiences based on sensory input in the context of volume perceptions, Specifically, they examine biases in the perception of volume due to container shape. The height of the container emerges as a vital dimension that consumers appear to use as a simplifying visual heuristic to make a volume judgment. However, perceived consumption, contrary to perceived volume, is related inversely to height. This lowered perceived consumption is hypothesized and shown to increase actual consumption. A series of seven laboratory experiments programmatically test model predictions. Results show that perceived volume, perceived consumption, and actual consumption are related sequentially. Furthermore, the authors show that container shape affects preference, choice, and postconsumption satisfaction. The authors discuss theoretical implications for contrast effects when expectancies are disconfirmed, specifically as they relate to biases in visual information processing, and provide managerial implications of the results for package design, communication, and pricing.

TI New product introduction and incumbent response strategies: Their
   interrelationship and the role of multimarket contact
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the author studies the determinants of both new product introduction and incumbent response strategies in a single integrated framework. Building on previous research in strategic management, industrial organization, and marketing, the author conceptually identifies the factors that potentially influence these strategies, develops hypotheses about the impact of the key factors on these strategies, and focuses on the interrelationship between new product introduction and incumbent response strategies and on the role of multimarket contact in these strategies. To test these hypotheses, the author formulates models of introduction and response strategies, including an anticipated incumbent reaction formation model. The results of the empirical analysis show that new product introduction strategy is influenced significantly by incumbent reaction strategy, and vice versa, The relationship of a new product's marketing spending to the anticipated incumbent reaction is different for incumbents of different sizes. The analysis shows that higher spending by a new brand results in incumbent response that is significantly lower in magnitude, The results also show that multimarket contact leads to both lower introduction spending and milder incumbent response. The author discusses the managerial implications of these results.

TI Brand equity dilution: Retailer display and context brand effects
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Consistency among the various elements of a marketing program is believed essential in building and maintaining brand image and equity. And yet, a brand's ultimate presentation to customers is controlled more often by the retailer than by the manufacturer. In this research, the authors demonstrate that the retailer's display decisions can negate the equity of an established brand. The authors suggest that this occurs because consumers have expectations about retail displays and the relationship among displayed brands. Display conditions that disconfirm these expectations can lead consumers to reevaluate the brand. Specifically, the results demonstrate that high-equity brand valuations are influenced by an unfamiliar context brand when (1) a mixed display structure leads consumers to believe that the context brand is diagnostic for judging the high-equity brand, (2) the precedence given to one brand over another in the display makes expectations about brand differences or similarities accessible, and (3) the unfamiliar context brand disconfirms these expectations.

TI A model of customer satisfaction with service encounters involving
   failure and recovery
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Customers often react strongly to service failures, so it is critical that an organization's recovery efforts be equally strong and effective. In this article, the authors develop a model of customer satisfaction with service failure/recovery encounters based on an exchange framework that integrates concepts from both the consumer satisfaction and social justice literature, using principles of resource exchange, mental accounting, and prospect theory. The research employs a mixed-design experiment, conducted using a survey method, in which customers evaluate various failure/recovery scenarios and complete a questionnaire with respect to an organization they recently had patronized. The authors execute the research in the context of two different service settings, restaurants and hotels. The results show that customers prefer to receive recovery resources that "match" the type of failure they experience in "amounts" that are commensurate with the magnitude of the failure that occurs. The findings contribute to the understanding of theoretical principles that explain customer evaluations of service failure/recovery encounters and provide managers with useful guidelines for establishing the proper "fit" between a service failure and the recovery effort.

TI Consumer choice process for experience goods: An econometric model and
   analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this research, the authors develop and execute an econometric framework to model and analyze the consumer choice process for experience products formally. The authors develop a multistage model that examines choice and postchoice behavior in the context of new movie choices. The modeling framework incorporates psychological variables, such as consumer expectations of choice set elements and latent product interest, and the influence of information sources, such as critic reviews and word of mouth, within a discrete choice formulation. Model estimation allows for the relationship between consumer choice and postchoice behavior. The authors develop an estimation procedure that explicitly accounts for measurement errors in the latent psychological variables. In particular, they propose a probit measurement error model that provides consistent parameter estimates. Data for the model estimation are obtained from a laboratory experiment and a field study, The empirical results provide insights into the role of psychological variables (such as consumer expectations and latent product interest) in consumers' choice decisions for new movies. The results also identify variables that influence consumers' postconsumption evaluations and word of mouth. The model estimation and findings provide both methodological and substantive insights.

AB This research helps Web developers apply knowledge on information search costs to the design of Web sites that sell consumer products or services. The goal of the research is to predict how subtle changes in the user interface design influence information search costs. With an empirical study, the authors compare 1411 choices subjects made regarding a business to patronize using paper and electronic telephone directories. The choices were contingent on information search costs imposed by the different media. By providing a theoretical basis for predicting differences in information search costs, the authors help designers create more effective Web sites for achieving their marketing objectives.

TI Sustained spending and persistent response: A new look at long-term
   marketing profitability
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB An intuitively appealing decision rule is to allocate a company's scarce marketing resources to where they have the greatest long-term benefit. This principle, however, is easier to accept than it is to execute, because long-run effects of marketing spending are difficult to estimate. The authors address this problem by examining the behavior of market response and marketing spending over time and identify four common strategic scenarios: business as usual, hysteresis in response, escalation, and evolving business practice. The authors explain and illustrate why each scenario can occur in practice and describe its positive and negative consequences for long-term profitability. The authors propose to use multivariate persistence measures to identify which of the four strategic scenarios is taking place and illustrate this approach in the pharmaceutical and packaged-food industries. The results substantiate the authors' proposition that the strategic scenario is a major determinant of marketing effectiveness and long-term profitability. This conclusion sets up a substantial agenda for further research.

TI Estimating price elasticities with theory-based priors
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors show how price elasticity estimates can be improved in demand systems that involve multiple brands and stores. They treat these demand models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, Unlike in more standard Bayesian hierarchical treatments, the authors use prior information based on the restrictions imposed by additive utility models. In an additive utility model approach, price elasticities are driven by a general substitution parameter as well as brand-specific expenditure elasticities. The authors employ a differential shrinkage approach in which price elasticities are held closely to the restrictions of the additive utility theory and store-to-store variation is accommodated through differences in expenditure elasticities. Application of these new methods to simulated and real store scanner data shows significant improvements over existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods.

TI Visual attention to repeated print advertising: A test of scanpath
   theory
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine consumers' visual attention during repeated exposures to print advertisements using eye-tracking methodology. The authors propose a statistical model comprising submodels for two key measures of visual attention to elements of the advertisement: attention duration and inter- and intraelement saccades. These measures are vital to understanding attention wear-out and the impact of repetition on advertising effectiveness but have not been considered in previous research. The results of two studies show that (1) attention duration decreases significantly across advertising repetitions and (2) attentional scanpaths, as measured through saccades, remain constant across advertising repetitions and across experimentally induced and naturally occurring conditions. Scanpaths obey a stationary, reversible, first-order Markov process. The authors offer implications for attention theory and advertising processing.

TI Buyer-seller relationships in business markets
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB During the past decade, marketing managers and scholars have focused increased attention on buyer-seller relationships in business markets,This article contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in this important arena. Building from theories of relationships and empirical research across several disciplines, the authors specify six key underlying dimensions (connectors) that characterize the manner in which buyers and sellers relate and conduct relationships, Measures for these relationship connectors (information exchange, operational linkages, legal bonds, cooperation, and relationship-specific adaptations by buyers and sellers) are developed in a series of pretests, Then, on the basis of relationship profiles for more than 400 buyer-seller relationships sampled from a wide array of industries and market situations, the authors apply numerical taxonomy to develop an empirically based classification of different types of business relationships. Contrary to approaches used in much of the extant literature, taxonomic methods do not rely on an assumption that the connectors are highly intercorrelated or that they combine in some linear fashion to form a single underlying dimension. Furthermore, the research specifies antecedent market and purchase situations and shows that they affect when specific types of relationships are used. The research also shows how customer satisfaction and evaluations of supplier performance vary across different types of relationships. The results provide new insights about the nature of relationships in business markets.

TI Pie-expansion efforts: Collaboration processes in buyer-supplier
   relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The business press has coined the term "pie expansion" to refer to the collaborative process of creating mutually beneficial strategic outcomes between buyers and suppliers. In this research, the author provides an explanation of this process, hypothesizing that such outcomes are achieved through the use of coordination efforts across organizational boundaries and specialized investments, The author investigates the facilitating roles of various environmental, interorganizational, and interpersonal conditions in this process. The results of a longitudinal survey of more than 220 buyers and suppliers indicate that the collaboration process is worthwhile, with coordination efforts and investments leading to enhanced profit performance and the realization of competitive advantages over time. Environmental dynamism and demand motivate suppliers to form collaborative exchanges with buyers and facilitate the dyad's willingness to create idiosyncratic investments. Goal congruence and interpersonal trust facilitate coordination effort, and complementary capabilities facilitate both effort and investments.

The authors show that the distribution of these estimates provides useful information for effectively managing marketing activities, In addition, the proposed model relates the measures of influence to covariates useful for identifying high-influence individuals. Predictive tests demonstrate that the proposed model, using an "inferred" measure of influence, leads to more accurate predictions than alternative measures.

TI Investigating household state dependence effects across categories
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Brand choices over time are dictated not just by households' intrinsic brand preferences, but also by marketing variables and state dependence effects. The authors examine brand choice behavior across five product categories as a function of these variables. Choice within a category is modeled with a multinomial probit model. A Bayesian variance components approach is used to model the covariation of household response parameters across categories. The model enables the authors to identify similarities in households' state dependence effects across categories. On the basis of purchase data from a panel of 785 households, they also (1) estimate the correlations between household parameters for the marketing mix and state dependence, (2) study whether state dependence effects diminish over time, (3) investigate whether state dependence for a household is related to its demographic and behavioral characteristics, and (4) analyze whether category variables influence state dependence.
   The results indicate that households display similar state dependence effects across the five categories, with two categories exhibiting significantly lower state dependence levels than the other three. Furthermore, significant correlations exist between state dependence effects and marketing mix sensitivities. A household's level of brand choice inertia diminishes with time elapsed since the previous purchase. State dependence is influenced by shopping behavior variables but not by demographics.

TI HlNoV: A new model to improve market segment definition by identifying
   noisy variables
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although cluster analysis is the procedure most frequently used to define data-based market segments, it is not without problems. This research addresses one of its major problems: the selection of the "best" subset of variables on which to cluster. If this selection is not made carefully, "noisy" variables that contain little clustering information can cause misleading results. To help isolate potentially noisy variables prior to clustering, the authors discuss a new algorithm, the Heuristic Identification of Noisy Variables (HINoV). They demonstrate its robustness with artificial data. In addition, the authors illustrate the potential of HINoV to yield more managerially useful market segments (clusters) when applied to two real marketing data sets. Implementation of HINoV is straightforward and will help avoid a major problem in using K-means cluster analysis for market segment definition, as well as for other similar types of research.

TI A characterization of retailer response to manufacturer trade deals
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the author provides a simple characterization of retailer response to manufacturer trade deals in terms of the consumer demand conditions that the retailer faces. Specifically, the author shows conditions on the curvature of consumer demand functions that make it optimal for a profit-maximizing retailer to pass through greater (less) than 100% of the trade deal amount it gets from a manufacturer, Using these conditions, the author demonstrates that whereas the linear and all concave consumer demand functions lead to less than 100% optimal retail pass-through, there exists a subset of convex consumer demand functions for which a retailer rationally engages in greater than 100% pass-through. This subset contains many commonly used demand functions, such as the constant elasticity demand function, the negative exponential demand function, and many other varying elasticity demand functions.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this research, the author examines the impact of brand extensions on consumer memory for parent brand information. The author proposes that such exposure will strengthen parent brand memory structures and facilitate retrieval processes. The author hypothesizes that the impact of extensions will be moderated by parent brand dominance, extension fit, extension number, and product category crowdedness. Two experiments are conducted. The first demonstrates that (1) exposure to brand extensions facilitates the speed with which subjects can categorize parent brands correctly, (2) this result is moderated by parent brand dominance such that nondominant brands benefit more from such exposure, and (3) extension fit moderates this effect for nondominant but not for dominant parent brands. The second study demonstrates that (1) longitudinal exposure to brand extension advertising facilitates parent brand recall but that (2) both recall and recognition are facilitated to a lesser degree than that resulting from exposure to parent brand advertising.

TI Buyer-supplier contracts versus joint ventures: Determinants and
   consequences of transaction structure
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB When a buyer firm and a supplier firm plan to transact, what factors drive their choice of mechanism to govern the relationship? Focusing on contract-governed versus joint venture-governed relationships, the authors present a theoretical framework that specifies the conditions that make one or the other form of relationship structure more appropriate. This study was designed to address potential limitations regarding measurement, financial consequences, and context in the extant literature. The authors employ measures derived from Standard & Poor's Compustat financial database and an overall measure of firm reputation to examine empirically differences in firm characteristics across the two types of relationships. To examine the financial consequences of relationship structure, the authors use event-study techniques that tie stock price reactions to the governance mechanism choice. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers are more likely to form a joint venture (versus simple contract) when (1) the supplier's degree of asset specificity is high, (2) monitoring the supplier's behavior is difficult, and (3) the supplier has a poorer reputation. The authors find that vertical joint ventures (between buyers and suppliers) are economically similar to contracts, to the extent that abnormal wealth gains go solely to the supplier firms. Horizontal joint ventures (partners are at the same level of the value chain), however, provide bilateral, synergistic wealth gains. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers can use joint ventures to reduce certain governance problems rather than to gain synergies.

TI The emergence of market structure in new repeat-purchase categories: The
   interplay of market share and retailer distribution
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors study brand-share dynamics among competing brands in new repeat-purchase categories. In such new categories, market shares are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can take into account the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market share and its distribution over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market share and distribution, is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market share and distribution. Empirical results using data from the U.S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market share and distribution exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early in the life of the new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in market share and distribution. Later, such momentum appears absent, In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market.

Beyond its ability to describe discontinuous diffusion patterns, the method explicitly recognizes the conceptual difference between the timing of a country's introduction of the new technology (the so-called implementation stage; Rogers 1983) and the timing of the innovation's full adoption in the country (the confirmation stage). To illustrate the method, the authors apply it to the global diffusion of digital telecommunications switches across more than 160 countries.

TI Consumer choice between hedonic and utilitarian goods
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors examine how consumer choice between hedonic and utilitarian goods is influenced by the nature of the decision task. Building on research on elaboration, the authors propose that the relative salience of hedonic dimensions is greater when consumers decide which of several items to give up (forfeiture choices) than when they decide which item to acquire (acquisition choices). The resulting hypothesis that a hedonic item is relatively preferred over the same utilitarian item in forfeiture choices than in acquisition choices was supported in two choice experiments. In a subsequent experiment, these findings were extended to hypothetical choices in which the acquisition and forfeiture conditions were created by manipulating initial attribute-level reference states instead of ownership. Finally, consistent with the experimental findings, a field survey showed that, relative to market prices, owners of relatively hedonic cars value their vehicles more than do owners of relatively utilitarian cars. The authors discuss theoretical implications of these reference-dependent preference asymmetries and explore consequences for marketing managers and other decision makers.

TI Inferring latent brand dependencies
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors develop a class of models to reconstruct brand-transition probabilities when individual brand purchase sequence information is not available. The authors introduce two general model forms by assuming different underlying mechanisms for individual heterogeneity in brand switching. The first model form captures individual heterogeneity by a latent class structure. The second model form captures individual heterogeneity by postulating that the brand-choice probabilities follow a Dirichlet distribution, which yields the popular Dirichlet multinomial formulation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with a view toward assessing whether individual transition probabilities can be captured from knowledge of only aggregated brand choices. Results indicate that the proposed method can indeed capture individual brand-transition probabilities under several different conditions. An empirical application illustrates how these models can be used to provide important information on individual brand transitions and the role of market-ingretated covariates.

TI A new dimension reduction approach for data-rich marketing environments:
   Sliced inverse regression
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB data-rich marketing environments (e.g., direct marketing or new product design), managers face an ever-growing need to reduce the number of variables effectively. To accomplish this goal, the authors introduce a new method called sliced inverse regression (SIR), which finds factors by taking into account the information contained in both the dependent and independent variables. Sliced inverse regression objectively identifies appropriate factors through simple statistical tests for determining the number of factors to retain and for assessing the significance of factor-loading coefficients. The authors make conceptual connections between SIR and several existing approaches, including principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Using Monte Carlo experiments, the authors demonstrate that SIR performs better than these approaches. Two empirical examples-designing a new executive business program and direct marketing by a catalog company-are presented to illustrate the application of SIR and to show that it outperforms both PLSR and PCR in these cases. In addition, the authors discuss how direct marketers can apply SIR to analyze large databases and to thus target customers effectively. In conclusion, SIR is a promising methodology in data-intensive marketing environments.

TI Controlling measurement errors in models of advertising competition
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Commercial market research firms provide information on advertising variables of interest, such as brand awareness or gross rating points, that are likely to contain measurement errors. This unreliability of measured variables induces bias in the estimated parameters of dynamic models of advertising. Consequently, advertisers either under- or overspend on advertising to maintain a desired level of brand awareness. Monte Carte studies show that the magnitude of bias can be serious when conventional estimation methods, such as ordinary least squares and errors in variables, are employed to obtain parameter estimates. Therefore, the authors have developed two new approaches that either reduce or eliminate parameter bias, Using these methods, advertisers can determine an unbiased optimal advertising budget, even if advertising variables are measured with error. The application of these methods to estimate the extent of measurement noise in empirical advertising data is illustrated.

TI Are consumer survey results distorted? Systematic impact of behavioral
   frequency and duration on survey response
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Using a large-scale consumer database created by AT&T, the authors investigate how actual behavioral frequency and duration systematically affect the direction of errors in consumer survey responses, By analyzing errors in consumers' reports on their frequency of using long-distance telephone calls, letters, cards, and visits for personal communication, the authors demonstrate that high-frequency groups underreported their behavioral frequencies, whereas low-frequency groups overreported them. Similarly, the results show that consumers underestimate the duration of lengthy telephone conversations, whereas they overestimate the duration of short ones, Overall, the authors find that people tend to overestimate both frequency and duration. These compressive regressive effects toward the mean and overall upward bias for both frequency and duration estimations result in a distorted view of the market, which will be incorrectly perceived to be more homogeneous and larger than it really is.

TI The evolution of brand preferences and choice behaviors of consumers new
   to a market
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine how brand preferences and response to marketing activity evolve for consumers new to a market. They develop a theoretical framework that begins with a consumer's first-ever purchase in a product category and describes subsequent purchases as components of sequential purchasing stages. The theory is based on the notion that choices made by consumers new to a market are driven by two competing forces: consumers' desire to collect information about alternatives and their aversion to trying risky ones. These forces give rise to three stages of purchasing: an information collection stage that focuses initially on low-risk, big brand names; a stage in which information collection continues but is extended to lesser-known brands; and a stage of information consolidation leading to preference for the brands that provide the greatest utility. The authors use a legit-mixture model with time-varying parameters to capture the choice dynamics of different consumer segments, The results show the importance of accounting for product experience and learning when studying the dynamic choice processes of consumers new to a market, Insights from this study can help marketers tailor their marketing activities as consumers gain purchasing experience.

TI Historical method in marketing research with new evidence on long-term
   market share stability
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Several researchers have advocated historical or longitudinal approaches to study marketing phenomena. Although some have applied this approach, more often it has been overlooked or denigrated. The author argues that historical method is capable of producing scientific knowledge that is currently useful, rather than simply a remembrance of the past. The author presents a complete description of the historical method, so researchers can use this article as a guide when applying this method. The value of the method is illustrated by examining the prevailing finding in the marketing literature that market shares are stable over time. Although this finding is considered an empirical generalization, an analysis of more than 650 brands in 100 categories raises doubts about the longevity of market share stability.

TI Cast demographics, unobserved segments, and heterogeneous switching
   costs in a television viewing choice model
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB An accurate television viewing choice model is an important tool for television executives and advertisers. The authors present a new viewing choice model, which differs from the traditional Rust-Alpert model in three ways: (1) It introduces a new show characteristic-the demographic characteristics of a show's cast; (2) it allows the preferences over the traditional show categories to be a function of both observable and unobservable individual characteristics; and (3) it allows the cost of switching among the viewing alternatives to vary across show types and individual characteristics. Cross-validated predictive testing shows that this model fits the data better than the Rust-Alpert model does. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that network executives can improve ratings by using this model. The authors predict that by following their scheduling strategies (in particular, by broadcasting comedies after 10:00 P.M.), ABC, CBS, and NBC could have increased their average ratings by 12.9%, 7.5%, and 6.7%, respectively, on selected evenings.

TI Choosing what I want versus rejecting what I do not want: An application
   of decision framing to product option choice decisions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the effects of using a subtractive versus an additive option-framing method on consumers' option choice decisions in three studies. The former option-framing method presents consumers with a fully loaded product and asks them to delete options they do not want. The latter presents them with a base model and asks them to add the options they do want. Combined, the studies support the managerial attractiveness of the subtractive versus the additive option-framing method. Consumers tend to choose more options with a higher total option price when they use subtractive versus additive option framing. This effect holds across different option price levels (Study 1) and product categories of varying price (Study 2). Moreover, this effect is magnified when subjects are asked to anticipate regret from their option choice decisions (Study 2). However, option framing has a different effect on the purchase likelihood of the product category itself, depending on the subject's initial interest in buying within the category. Although subtractive option framing offers strong advantages to managers when product commitment is high, it appears to demotivate category purchase when product commitment is low (Study 3). In addition, the three studies reveal several other findings about the attractiveness of subtractive versus additive option framing from the standpoint of consumers and managers. These findings, in turn, offer interesting public policy and future research implications.

TI Consumer response to negative publicity: The moderating role of
   commitment
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Even though negative information about brands and companies is widely prevalent in the marketplace, except for case studies, there has been no systematic investigation of how consumers process negative information about the brands they like and use. In the three studies in this research, the authors attempt to bridge this gap. The findings of the first and second studies provide a theoretical framework for understanding how consumers process negative information in the marketplace. Commitment of the consumer toward the brand is identified as a moderator of negative information effects. In the third study, the authors use this theoretical framework to derive and test response strategies that companies can use to counter negative publicity for consumers who are high and low in commitment toward the brand.

TI Impact of product-harm crises on brand equity: The moderating role of
   consumer expectations
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Brand equity is a valuable yet fragile asset. The mounting frequency of product-harm crises and ill-prepared corporate responses to such crises can have profound consequences for brand equity. Yet there is little research on the marketing impact of crises. The authors employ the expectations-evidence framework to understand the impact of firms' responses to crises on customer-based brand equity. The results of a field survey and two laboratory experiments indicate that consumers interpret firm response on the basis of their prior expectations about the firm. The interaction of expectations and firm response is shown to affect postcrisis brand equity. The authors draw implications for the expectations-evidence framework and for the outcomes of different types of firm response (i.e., unambiguous support, ambiguous response, and unambiguous stonewalling) on brand equity.

TI Control mechanisms and the relationship life cycle: Implications for
   safeguarding specific investments and developing commitment
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Powerful suppliers often require retailers to make significant idiosyncratic investments to improve coordination between organizations and to enhance the supplier's presence in the end market. The authors examine how a retailer might better manage the hold-up potential of these transaction-specific investments (TSIs) through the use of three control mechanisms: supplier's TSIs, the development of relational norms, and the use of explicit contracts. Moreover, the authors consider the time-dependent nature of these mechanisms by observing their effects on commitment over the course of a relationship life cycle. The results indicate that (1) a retailer's TSIs have a negative effect on its perceptions of supplier commitment; (2) a supplier's TSIs and relational norms increase the retailer's perception of supplier commitment, whereas explicit contracts are associated with perceptions of lower supplier commitment; and (3) each of the three control mechanisms moderates the negative impact of retailer investments on perceptions of supplier commitment contingent on the relationship phase. Specifically, bilateral TSIs enhance commitment in the exploration phase and a positive effect during the decline phase. The results also indicate that the retailer's perceptions of supplier commitment are positively related to its evaluation of supplier performance and satisfaction and negatively related to conflict.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Empirical research on reference price has typically assumed that consumers use either an internal reference price (IRP) or an external reference price (ERP), but not both, in brand choice decisions. In this article, the authors assume that consumers use both IRP and ERP but may consider one of them more salient than the other. The authors develop a model that segments consumers on the basis of the differences in the importance they assign to each type of reference price as well as in their brand preferences and responses to marketing-mix variables. The authors calibrate the model on data for four categories: liquid detergents, ketchup, tissue, and yogurt. In all four categories, the proposed model performs significantly better than the one that assumes that consumers use either IRP or ERP exclusively. The authors discuss the managerial implications of this finding.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB in this research, the authors merge an established methodology-hierarchical Bayesian modeling-and an existing utility model-Farquhar and Rao's (1976) balance model-to describe individual choices among assortments of multiattributed items. This approach facilitates addressing three managerial questions of direct importance: (1) Which assortment of a given size has the most customers for whom it is the preferred assortment (and what fraction of customers)? (2) Which products should be added to a given assortment to maximize the fraction of customers who can find their most preferred assortment? and (3) For a given assortment, what type of customer is likely to purchase it? The model is applied to assortment choices constructed from a set of eight popular magazines with five measured attributes: business, current events, human interest stories, sports, and technology. The analysis indicates that consumers are heterogeneous: Some customers are price sensitive and unresponsive to the magazine attributes, and others are sensitive to the magazine features but do not necessarily want more of them. In addition, the authors observe that many subjects do not prefer varied assortments; rather, consumers focus on purchasing magazines with high levels of the attribute they want.

In this article, the authors propose a brand-level diffusion model and demonstrate its managerial use by applying it to the following issue: If a new brand enters a category that has not attained its peak sales, how can a practicing manager evaluate its impact on the category and on the incumbent brands? The proposed model helps the manager diagnose whether the late entrant affects the market potential and/or the diffusion speed of the category and of the incumbent brands.

TI Building store loyalty through store brands
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors study the role of a store brand in building store loyalty through a game theoretic analysis. In a market in which a segment of consumers is sensitive to product quality and consumers' brand choice in low-involvement packaged goods categories is characterized by inertia, the authors show that quality store brands can be an instrument for retailers to generate store differentiation, store loyalty, and store profitability, even when the store brand does not have a margin advantage over the national brand. In addition, this loyalty argument does not apply for the "cheap and nasty" private label strategy. Such a private label policy, on the contrary, reinforces rather than reduces price competition among stores. Indeed, the quality of the store brand must be above a threshold level to create this opportunity. It also follows that quality store brands, when carried by competing retailers, can be an implicit coordination mechanism that enables all the retailers to become more profitable. Finally, a quality store brand policy is profitable only if a significant portion of shoppers buys the national brand. This surprising result establishes the complementary roles of store brands and national brands. The former create store differentiation and loyalty, whereas the latter enable the retailer to raise prices and increase store profitability. The authors provide empirical support for their thesis by using evidence from Europe and household-level scanner panel data from the United States and Canada.

As the Internet is used by more consumers, firms' pricing and communications strategies on the Internet will mirror the strategies they pursue in a conventional channel. Firms can increase their market power by strategically using information on multiple channels to achieve finer consumer segmentation. The author suggests directions the Internet might take and derives managerial implications. The findings generalize to other channels that enable firms to segment consumers and inform them at low cost.

SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the extent to which cultural orientation influences country of origin effects on product evaluations in two countries (Japan and the United States). Subjects were given attribute information about a mountain bike made in either japan or the United States. The target product was described as either superior or inferior to competition. Respondents in Japan evaluated the product that originated in the home country (versus foreign country) more favorably regardless of product superiority. In contrast, respondents in the United States evaluated the product that originated in the home country more favorably only when the product was superior to competition. The authors explain these findings on the basis of the cultural psychological principles of individualism and collectivism. Specifically, the authors show that the vertical dimension of individualism and collectivism explains country of origin effects. The authors also discuss implications for global marketing strategies featuring country of origin.

TI The effects of analyzing reasons for brand preferences: Disruption or
   reinforcement?
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Different streams of research offer seemingly conflicting predictions as to the effects of analyzing reasons for preferences on the attitude-behavior link. The authors apply these different theoretical accounts to a new product scenario and identify conditions under which analyzing reasons for brand preferences can increase or decrease the predictive value of reported preferences. Consistent with dual-process theories of persuasion, in Study 1 the authors find that reasons analysis increases the link between attitude and behavior when the measure of behavior closely follows attitude measurement. In contrast, and consistent with research by Wilson and colleagues (e.g., Wilson et al. 1989) on the disruptive effects of reasons analysis, the authors find that thinking about reasons significantly decreases the attitude-behavior correlation when the observed behavior occurs after a substantial delay. Study 2 not only replicates this finding but also suggests that the timing of the reasons task can be an important moderator of the disruption effect. Specifically, the authors draw on the literature on accountability effects to show that even when there is a delay between attitude and behavior measurement, reasons analysis leads to an increase in the attitude-behavior link, as long as reasons are analyzed after attitude measurement. finally, in Study 3, the authors validate the account of the effects of reasons analysis by obtaining parallel findings for attitude persistence. Together, the studies offer preliminary advice to both practitioners and academics regarding the potential effects of asking consumers to think about why they like or dislike certain products.

TI A connectionist model of brand-quality associations
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Consumers use brand names and product features to predict the performance of products. Various learning models offer hypotheses about the source of these predictive associations. Spreading-activation models hypothesize that cues acquire predictive value as a consequence of being present during the acquisition of product performance information. Least mean squares connectionist models hypothesize that any one cue acquires predictive value only to the extent that it can predict differences in performance that are not already predicted by other available cues. Five studies in the context of portfolio-branding strategies provide evidence supporting a least mean squares connectionist model. As predicted by this model, results show that subbranding and ingredient-branding strategies can protect brands from dilution in some situations but can promote dilution in other situations.

TI An experimental and theoretical analysis of price-matching refund
   policies
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Price-matching refund policies, or offers by firms to match competitor's prices, are common in both consumer and industrial marketing. Much of the previous theoretical work in economics suggests that price-matching refunds are associated with higher prices. In contrast, the trade press postulates that price-matching policies are associated with lower prices. Given these inconsistent views regarding price-matching policies, the authors experimentally examine how consumers view and interpret such policies and then develop a model that incorporates these consumer interpretations as well as asymmetries across stores. In the model, the asymmetry across stores is the key to deriving the conditions under which a signaling equilibrium exists in the presence of price-matching policies. The critical point is that the competition-reducing and price discrimination effects, which seem to form the basis of most of the previous theoretical literature, can be counteracted by the presence of differentiated firms and uninformed consumers. The model suggests that under some conditions, price-matching policies can lead to more intense price competition. Furthermore, all firms will not find it profitable to offer refunds, and consistent with consumer expectations, the firms with lower prices will offer refunds.

TI Internet recommendation systems
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Several online firms, including Yahoo!, Amazon.com, and Movie Critic, recommend documents and products to consumers. Typically, the recommendations are based on content and/or collaborative filtering methods. The authors examine the merits of these methods, suggest that preference models used in marketing offer good alternatives, and describe a Bayesian preference model that allows statistical integration of five types of information useful for making recommendations: a person's expressed preferences, preferences of other consumers, expert evaluations, item characteristics, and individual characteristics. The proposed method accounts for not only preference heterogeneity across users but also unobserved product heterogeneity by introducing the interaction of unobserved product attributes with customer characteristics. The authors describe estimation by means of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and use the model with a large data set to recommend movies either when collaborative filtering methods are viable alternatives or when no recommendations can be made by these methods.

TI Response latencies in the analysis of conjoint choice experiments
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Response latencies provide information about consumers' choice behavior in a conjoint choice experiment. The authors use filtered response latencies to scale the covariance matrix of a multinomial probit model and show that this leads to better model fit and holdout predictions, even if the response latencies in the holdout task are not used. The authors provide an empirical application along with a tentative explanation for the findings of the effect of response latencies.

TI The estimation of pre- and postpromotion dips with store-level scanner
   data
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB One of the mysteries of store-level scanner data modeling is the lack of a dip in sales in the weeks following a promotion. Researchers expect to find a postpromotion dip because analyses of household scanner panel data indicate that consumers tend to accelerate their purchases in response to a promotion-that is, they buy earlier and/or purchase larger quantities than they would in the absence of a promotion. Thus, there should also be a pronounced dip in store-level sales in the weeks following a promotion. However, researchers rarely find such dips at either the category or the brand level. Several arguments have been proposed to account for the lack of a postpromotion dip in store-level sales data and to explain why dips may be hidden. Because dips are difficult to detect by traditional models (and by a visual inspection of the data), the authors propose models that can account for a multitude of factors that together cause complex pre- and postpromotion dips. The authors use three alternative distributed lead and lag structures: an Almon model, an unrestricted dynamic effects model, and an exponential decay model. In each model, the authors include four types of price discounts: without any support, with display-only support, with feature-only support, and with feature and display support. The models are calibrated on store-level scanner data for two product categories: tuna and toilet tissue. The authors estimate the dip to be between 4 and 25% of the current sales effect, which is consistent with household-level studies.

AB The author explores how consumers anticipate product or service usage during the purchase deliberation and develops a descriptive model of the decision process in which consumers integrate their usage expectations into the choice between paying a flat fee for unlimited access or paying per use. The model helps explain why consumers habitually overestimate the likelihood of using enough to justify the flat fee and how this misperception depends on the perceived range of usage anticipated by the user.

TI Parameter bias from unobserved effects in the multinomial logit model of
   consumer choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Over the past two decades, validation of choice models has focused on predictive validity rather than parameter bias. In real-world validation of choice models, true parameter values are unknown, so examination of parameter bias is not possible. In contrast, the main focus of this study is parameter bias in simulated scanner-panel choice data with known parameter values. Study of parameter bias enables the assessment of a fundamental issue not addressed in the choice modeling literature-the extent to which the logit choice model is capable of distinguishing unobserved effects that give rise to persistence in observed choices (e,g., heterogeneity and state dependence). Although econometric theory provides some information about the causes of bias, the extent of such bias in typical scanner data applications remains unclear. The authors present an extensive simulation study that provides information on the extent of bias resulting from the misspecification of four unobserved effects that receive frequent attention in the literature-choice set effects, heterogeneity in preferences and market response, state dependence, and serial correlation. The authors outline implications for model builders and managers. In general, the potential for parameter bias in choice model applications appears to be high. Overall, a logit model with choice set effects and the Guadagni-Little loyalty variable produces the most valid parameter estimates.

TI The effects of incomplete information on consumer choice
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Two current trends, information overload and marketers' increased control over the manner in which their products are sold and presented to buyers (e.g., on the Internet), suggest that deciding what information to provide or not to provide can determine a product's success in the marketplace. Although it has long been recognized that most purchase decisions are made with incomplete information, researchers still know little about the effect of missing information on consumer choice. Building on prior work by Slovic and MacFhillamy (1974), the authors demonstrate that a tendency to give more weight to attributes on which all considered options have values (common attributes), compared with attributes for which not all options have values (unique attributes), can often lead to intransitive preferences. Using process measures, the authors further show that buyers tend to interpret missing attribute values in a way that supports the purchase of the option that is superior on the common attribute. The results indicate that information presentation format and inferences about missing value cannot account for the observed effects of missing information on consumer choice. The authors also show that the purchase decisions of buyers who consider attribute importance before making a choice and those with high need for cognition are less susceptible to influence by missing information. Finally, the findings indicate that choosing from sets with missing information can affect buyer tastes and purchase decisions made subsequently. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.

   Measurement issues and performance outcomes
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Previous research addressing market orientation from a cultural perspective typically has used behavioral measures of this construct. Drawing on literature in the fields of organizational theory and marketing, the authors develop a multilayer model of market-oriented organizational culture. They draw an explicit distinction among values that support market orientation, norms for market orientation, artifacts indicating high and low market orientation, and market-oriented behaviors. On the basis of qualitative research and a subsequent survey, the authors develop scales for measuring the different layers of market-oriented culture and analyze relationships among the different components of market-oriented culture. Findings indicate that artifacts play a crucial role in determining behavior within organizations. Results a so indicate that a market-oriented culture influences financial performance indirectly through market performance and that this relationship is stronger in highly dynamic markets.

TI From uncertain intentions to actual behavior: A threshold model of
   whether and when salespeople quit
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors focus on the formation of intentions to quit among salespeople and the link between these intentions and subsequent quitting behavior. Building on the foundations of the recently developed judgment uncertainty and magnitude parameters (JUMP) model, which statistically and simultaneously separates the drivers of judgment magnitude from those of judgment uncertainty, the authors present a model of the formation of uncertain intentions that decomposes a stated intention into a magnitude and an uncertainty dimension. The authors then develop hypotheses regarding the impact of affective and continuance commitment and critical sales events on intention magnitude and the effect of critical sales events and role stress on intention uncertainty. Subsequently, the authors develop a threshold model of the intention behavior link that articulates;a psychological mechanism within which uncertainty-laden intentions translate into actual behavior. Empirically, results from sales force intention and turnover data provide strong support for the theorizing. In addition to identifying some drivers of intention-to-quit magnitude and uncertainty, the authors identify the crucial role of intention uncertainty in shaping both the probability and timing of subsequent behavior. Consistent with the psychological underpinnings of the threshold model, the authors find that intention uncertainty lowers the probability of intended behavior. The results regarding the timing of quitting support an uncertainty avoidance conjecture: Given a stated intention, likely quitters with greater intention uncertainty quit faster than those with lower intention uncertainty.

TI Modeling fuzzy data in qualitative marketing research
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In marketing, qualitative data are used in theory development to investigate marketing phenomena in more depth. After qualitative data are collected, the judgment-based classification of items into categories is routinely used to summarize and communicate the information contained in the data. In this article, the authors provide marketing researchers with a method that (1) provides useful substantive information about the proportion and degree to which items belong to several categories and (2) measures the classification accuracy of the judges. The model is called the fuzzy latent class model (FLCM), because it extends Dillon and Mulani's (1984) latent class model by freeing it from the restrictive assumption that all items are crisp for a given categorization. Instead, FLCM allows for items to be either crisp or fuzzy. Crisp items belong exclusively to one category, whereas fuzzy items belong-in varying degree-to multiple categories. This relaxation in the assumption about the nature of qualitative data makes FLCM more widely applicable: Qualitative data in marketing research are often fuzzy, because they involve open-ended descriptions of complex phenomena. The authors also propose a moment-based measure of overall data fuzziness that is bounded by 0 (completely crisp) and 1 (completely fuzzy).

TI Factor analysis and missing data
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors study the estimation of factor models and the imputation of missing data and propose an approach that provides direct estimates of factor weights without the replacement of missing data with imputed values. First, the approach is useful in applications of factor analysis in the presence of missing data. Second, the proposed factor analysis model may be used as a vehicle for imputing missing data, producing a complete data set that can be analyzed subsequently with some other method. Here, the factor model itself is not of primary interest but presents a suitable model for purposes of imputation. The proposed method accommodates various patterns of missing data commonly found in marketing. The framework for factor analysis the authors develop deals with both discrete and continuous variables and gives rise to several models not considered previously. The authors illustrate various factor models on synthetic data, investigating their performance when missing data are present and when the distribution of the observed variables is incorrectly specified. The authors provide two empirical studies of the performance of the approach. In the first, the authors demonstrate how the proposed approach recovers the true (complete-data) factor structure in the presence of missing observations that occur because of item nonresponse and compare the procedure with three alternative methods traditionally used for handling missing data in factor analysis. In the second application, the factor model is used as a vehicle to impute data that are missing by design.

TI Testing the reliability of weight elicitation methods: Direct rating
   versus point allocation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Two commonly used methods of assigning numerical judgments (i.e., importance weights) to attributes in order to signify their relative importance are point allocation (PA) and direct rating (DR). These methods may seem to be minor variants of each other, yet they produce very different profiles of attribute weights when rank ordered from most to least important. The weights elicited by DR were more reliable than those elicited by PA in a test-retest situation. An important practical implication of this is for multicriteria decision making. Using people's test-retest data as attribute weights on simulated alternative values revealed that the same alternative would be chosen on 88% of occasions with DR, but only 74% of occasions with PA. Moreover, subjects reacted more favorably to DR than to PA.

TI A multiple-item model of paired comparisons: Separating chance from
   latent preference
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop a flexible model to analyze relative preference scores: the binomial/Dirichlet model. This model assumes that (I) individual respondents make independent draws from binomial distributions when stating their preferences and (2) the latent (unobserved) preference parameters vary across respondents according to a Dirichlet distribution. Through the analysis of 44 tests that include from two to five products each, the authors show that the model fits the data relatively well. A multinomial/Dirichlet extension of the model that applies to repeat preference tests of two items provides a better fit than an alternative mixture model despite fewer parameters. To test two items and obtain an accuracy of +/-.05 with a 95% confidence interval for the mean preference intensities, a multinomial/Dirichlet model requires two paired comparisons (made at two points in time) per respondent and a sample size of 400; these requirements represent half the required number of preference measurements per respondent and half the required sample size of alternative methods. Although the illustrative examples refer to the comparison of known brands and unidentified products, the proposed methodology can be applied to many contexts, including the evaluation of product profiles in conjoint analysis.

TI Truth or consequences: An analysis of vaporware and new product
   announcements
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The software industry practice of announcing new products well in advance of actual market availability has led to allegations that firms are intentionally engaged in vaporware. The possible predatory and anticompetitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal among firms, the authors consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing similar new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms use vaporware in a strategic manner. The authors then formulae and analyze the preannouncement and introduction timing decisions in a game-theoretic model of two competing firms. They find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs and that intentional vaporware can deter entry. The authors also show that there is a curvlinear relationship between development costs and announcement accuracy; that is, firms with high or very low product development costs make accurate product announcements, whereas firms with intermediate product development costs intentionally engage in vaporware. Empirical support for these theoretical results is also found in the software industry data. Finally, the authors discuss the beneficial and harmful consequences of vaporware and the associated implications.

TI Entrenched knowledge structures and consumer response to new products
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although diffusion models have been successfully used to predict the adoption patterns of new products and technologies, little research has examined the psychological processes underlying the individual consumer's adoption decision. This research uses the knowledge transfer paradigm, studied often in the context of analogies, to demonstrate that both existing knowledge and innovation continuity are major factors influencing the consumer's adoption process. In two experiments, the authors demonstrate that the relationship between expertise and adoption is relatively complex. Specifically their findings indicate that, compared with novices, experts report higher comprehension, more net benefits, and therefore higher preferences for continuous innovations. However, for discontinuous innovations, experts' entrenched knowledge is related to lower comprehension, fewer perceived net benefits, and lower preferences compared with that of novices. Only when this entrenched knowledge is accompanied by relevant information from a supplementary knowledge base are experts able to understand and appreciate discontinuous innovations. These findings have implications for segmentation, media planning, and the creation of product/brand loyalty.

TI Transaction decoupling: How price bundling affects the decision to
   consume
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In today's marketplace, price bundling is widespread: Manufacturers and retailers routinely offer multiple products for a single, bundled price. Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or "decoupling" of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.

TI Examining the impact of destructive acts in marketing channel
   relationships
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In virtually all marketing channel relationships, one of the parties eventually will engage in an action that another channel member considers potentially destructive for the relationship. How a particular channel member reacts to such an act has implications for the long-term viability and success of the relationship. On the basis of a large data set collected from both a focal supplier and its independent dealers, the authors classify dealers' responses to a supplier's destructive acts by extending the response 'typology of exit, voice, and loyalty, which is based on Hirschman's seminal writings on responses to decline in organizations and states. This study finds that dealers' reactions are influenced by several antecedent factors: perceived intensity of the supplier's destructive act, the attributions relative to the act, relationship quality before the act, and the level of interdependence between dealer and supplier. The results suggest that these more proximal dealer responses affect subsequent dealer performance and overall perceptions of relationship quality after an act. The authors draw several implications for both dealers and suppliers.

   and hiding the truth
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors develop a conceptual framework of how managers interpret competitors' signals over time in various market contexts. From the framework, the authors generate hypotheses about the relative effectiveness of signaling strategies used by firms in different market contexts. The authors conducted two empirical studies involving a repeated entry-pricing game to test the hypotheses. The results of Study 1 show that the entrant's perceptions of the aggressiveness of the incumbent depend on the focus and strength of the incumbent's signals. The results of Study 2 show that the strength of the entrant's responses to the incumbent's signals depends on the incumbent's use of bluffs and the cost of information about the factors driving the incumbent's signals. The implications of these findings for how firms should signal to achieve such strategic objectives as revealing or concealing information, developing a desired reputation, and influencing competitors' responses over time are discussed. The authors conclude by discussing the limitations of the article and its implications for further research.

TI Cross-functional product development teams, creativity, and the
   innovativeness of new consumer products
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Multiple studies have found that the primary determinant of new product failure is an absence of innovativeness-the extent to which a new product provides meaningfully unique benefits. Given the persistence of this finding and the: growing use of cross-functional teams in new product development projects, the authors examine how innovativeness is affected by various characteristics of cross-functional teams and contextual influences on the team. On the basis of a study of 149 cross-functional product development teams, the authors find that innovativeness is positively related to the strength of superordinate identity in the team, encouragement to take risk, customers' influence, and active monitoring of the project by senior management. Beyond a moderate level, social cohesion among team members has a negative effect on innovativeness. The effect of superordinate identity on innovativeness is strengthened by encouragement to take risk and weakened by social cohesion. Functional diversity has no effect on innovativeness. The authors discuss managerial and research implications of the findings.

TI "Pie sharing" in complex collaboration contexts
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Recently, there has been a growing interest in the development of collaborative relationships between organizations. Much attention has been given to how organizations "expand the pie" of benefits between them; however, there is little that addresses the ensuing issue: how organizations divide the expanded pie. The author examines the relational impact of pie sharing in complex collaboration contexts marked by uncertainty in resources and output, information asymmetries, intangible aspects, and noncomparable factors and processes. The author develops a conceptual framework that examines how the use of equity and equality sharing principles in conjunction with various resource and organizational conditions can be used to affect relational outcomes systematically. Survey results of 300 research and development managers, scientists, and engineers indicate that sharing principles can have a positive or negative effect on the relationship depending on the type of sharing principle used and the characteristics of the resources and organizations. In particular, sharing processes should be responsive to the goals of the collaboration. The results underscore the strategic nature of the sharing phenomenon as well as the importance of relational concerns in complex and uncertain interorganizational settings.

TI Misleading heuristics and moderated multiple regression models
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Moderated multiple regression models allow the simple relationship between the dependent variable and an independent variable to depend on the level of another independent variable. The moderated relationship, often referred to as the interaction, is modeled by including a product term as an additional independent variable. Moderated relationships are central to marketing (e.g., Does the effect of promotion on sales depend on the market segment?). Multiple regression models not including a product term are widely used and well understood. The authors argue that researchers have derived from this simpler type of multiple regression several data analysis heuristics that, when inappropriately generalized to moderated multiple regression, can result in faulty interpretations of model coefficients and incorrect statistical analyses, Using theoretical arguments and constructed data sets, the authors describe these heuristics, discuss how they may easily be misapplied, and suggest some good practices for estimating, testing, and interpreting regression models that include moderated relationships.

TI An empirical analysis of firms' product line decisions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Despite the importance of product line management as a competitive tool, empirical research addressing the determinants of firm product line decisions is sparse. In this article, the authors propose and empirically estimate a descriptive model of firm product line decisions in the personal computer industry over the period 1981-92. The model incorporates the firm's initial choice of the direction of a product line change (i.e., the product line can be expanded, contracted, or maintained) and the conditional choice related to the magnitude of any product line change (i.e., how many products to introduce or withdraw). The authors show that there are important substantive insights to be gained by analyzing the product line decision in this fashion. In the personal computer industry, for example, firms expand their product lines when industry barriers are low or market opportunities are perceived to exist. High market share firms aggressively expand their product lines, as do firms with relatively high prices or short product lines. In general, the results highlight the various internal and external factors that influence firms' management of their product lines.

TI Satisfaction, repurchase intent, and repurchase behavior: Investigating
   the moderating effect of customer characteristics
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Despite the claim that satisfaction ratings are linked to repurchase behavior, few attempts can be found that relate satisfaction ratings to actual repurchase behavior. This article fills this void by presenting a conceptual model for relating satisfaction ratings and repurchase behavior. The model is based on the premise that ratings observed in a typical customer satisfaction survey are error-prone measures of the customer's true satisfaction, and they may vary systematically on the basis of consumer characteristics. The authors apply the model to a large-scale study of 100,040 automotive customers. Results show that consumers with different characteristics have different thresholds such that, at the same level of rated satisfaction, repurchase rates are systematically different among different customer groups. The authors also find that the nature and extent of response bias in satisfaction ratings varies by customer characteristics. In one group, the response bias is so high that rated satisfaction is completely uncorrelated to repurchase behavior (r = 0). Furthermore, the authors find that, though nonlinear, the functional form relating rated satisfaction to repurchase intent is different from the one relating it to repurchase behavior. Although the functional form exhibits decreasing returns in the case of repurchase intent, it exhibits monotonically increasing returns in the case of repurchase behavior.

TI Response styles in marketing research: A cross-national investigation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Response styles are a source of contamination in questionnaire ratings, and therefore they threaten the validity of conclusions drawn from marketing research data. In this article, the authors examine five forms of stylistic responding (acquiescence and disacquiescence response styles, extreme response style/response range, midpoint responding, and noncontingent responding) and discuss their biasing effects on scale scores and correlations between scales. Using data from large, representative samples of consumers from 11 countries of the European Union, the authors find systematic effects of response styles on scale scores as a function of two scale characteristics (the proportion of reverse-scored items and the extent of deviation of the scale mean from the midpoint of the response scale) and show that correlations between scales can be biased upward or downward depending on the correlation between the response style components. In combination with the apparent lack of concern with response styles evidenced in a secondary analysis of commonly used marketing scales, these findings suggest that marketing researchers should pay greater attention to the phenomenon of stylistic responding when constructing and using measurement instruments.

TI Remote purchase environments: The influence of return policy leniency on
   two-stage decision processes
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The growth of catalog sales and the enormous potential of e-commerce elevates the importance of understanding remote purchase. Remote purchase environments differ from traditional bricks-and-mortar purchases in that the purchase decision is more likely to be framed as two separate decisions: consumers' decisions to order and, upon receipt, their decisions to keep or return the item. These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer. Results from three experiments provide support for the idea that product ownership depends more on perception than possession.

TI In search of negative customer feedback: The effect of expecting to
   evaluate on satisfaction evaluations
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Customers' evaluations of quality and satisfaction are critical inputs in the development of marketing strategies. Given the increasingly common practice of asking for such evaluations, buyers of products (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., hotels, educational programs/courses) often know in advance that they subsequently will be asked to provide their evaluations. In a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that expecting to evaluate leads to less favorable quality and satisfaction evaluations and reduces customers' willingness to purchase and recommend the evaluated services. The negative bias of expected evaluations is observed when actual quality is either low or high, and it persists even when buyers are told explicitly to consider both the positive and negative aspects. The authors examine three possible explanations for this systematic bias, which are referred to as negativity enhancement, role expectation, and vigilant processing. The findings are most consistent with the negativity enhancement account, indicating that unless buyers begin the evaluation task with low expectations, they tend to focus during consumption primarily on negative aspects of product/service quality. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this research.

TI Choice menus for mass customization: An experimental approach for
   analyzing customer demand with an application to a Web-based information
   service
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Customers are now active collaborators in creating value. Companies are increasingly engaging in mass customization and offering consumers a "choiceboard" (or a menu of choices) of various features and options for configuring their own products and services. The authors discuss the use of experimental choice menus for assessing customers' preferences and price sensitivities for the variety of features and options that might be offered by a firm in its choiceboard. The proposed approach directly analyzes customers' portfolio of choices from each of several experimental menus by estimating the utility for each menu item as a function of its characteristics, its price, and other specific attributes such as multifeature discounts. The authors accommodate customer heterogeneity in the utilities, allow for correlation of the utilities across items, and incorporate constraints in menu choices. Various technical issues and methodological contributions are discussed. The authors illustrate the approach in a commercial application of a customized Web-based information service, which is typical of offerings in the information economy. To assess predictive performance, the authors compare the proposed approach with alternative traditional approaches. The authors conclude with a discussion of the types of insights that can be obtained from this approach to menu choices and the managerial implications of these findings.

TI Semiparametric analysis to estimate the deal effect curve
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The marketing literature suggests several phenomena that may contribute to the nature of the relationship between sales and price discounts. These phenomena can produce complex nonlinearities and interactions in the deal effect curve that are best captured with a flexible approach. Because a fully nonparametric regression model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the authors propose a semiparametric regression model. Store-level sales over time are modeled as a nonparametric function of own- and cross-item price discounts and a parametric function of other predictors, The authors compare the predictive validity of the semiparametric model with that of two parametric benchmark models and obtain superior performance. The results for three product categories indicate threshold and saturation effects for both own-and cross-item temporary price cuts. The authors also find that the nature of the own-item curve depends on other items' price discounts. Comparisons with restricted model specifications show that both the flexible main effects and flexible interaction effects contribute to the superior results for the semiparametric approach. The interaction effects are so complex that it is unlikely for any parametric model to be satisfactory. In a separate analysis, the authors illustrate how the shape of the deal effect curve depends on own-item promotion signals. There is a crossover interaction effect: For the item analyzed, feature advertising produces a higher sales effect up to a 20% discount, whereas display achieves higher sales for discounts in excess of 20%.

More specifically, the authors find that CSR initiatives can, under certain conditions, decrease consumers' intentions to buy a company's products.

TI The joint spatial representation of multiple variable batteries
   collected in marketing research
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Marketing research studies pertaining to market segmentation, competitive market structure, and product/service positioning often involve the collection of multiple batteries of measurements from the same set of respondents (e.g., preferences, attribute ratings, demographics, proximity judgments). Various multidimensional scaling (MDS) and spatial methods have been used in the analysis of these variable batteries separately, but not much effort has been expended in attempting to relate the individually derived spatial structures. The authors propose a new latent structure MDS procedure that is devised to represent jointly the structure in multiple batteries (preferences, proximities, and brand attribute ratings) of variables collected across the same set of respondents. The authors present the technical structure of the proposed maximum likelihood-based model and conceptually compare it with other related spatial MDS models. The authors present an illustration of the procedure with respect to the analysis of published proximity, preference, and brand ratings data collected from consumers who evaluated ten brands of soft drinks.

TI Subscale distance and item clustering effects in self-administered
   surveys: A new metric
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors explore the effect of a form of question context on responses to a computer-mediated marketing research survey. As an increasing proportion of marketing research is conducted through computer interfaces, the pool of potential context effects is rapidly expanding. The authors conduct an experiment using a multi-item scale that consists of five dimensions and manipulate three such context effects: explicit item labeling, item presentation (alone/grouped), and subscate items presented contiguously or not. In a refined analysis of variance, the authors use a special one-dimensional case of the spatial and attribute-based distance metric proposed by Hoch, Bradlow, and Wansink (1999) to explain subscale variance, replacing the indicator variable for clustering used in a standard analysis of variance. This metric provides a scalar measure of how much variation exists in the order of presentation of items within a subscale (the subscale distance). This analysis indicates a significant decrease in subscale variance (increased reliability) with decreasing subscale distance but no-longer-significant effects due to labeling and grouping. The authors discuss implications of their findings for researchers conducting surveys in computer-mediated environments.

TI Managing customer-initiated contacts with manufacturers: The impact on
   share of category requirements and word-of-mouth behavior
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine behavioral outcomes following a customer-initiated contact (CIC) with a manufacturer and develop a framework to explain the impact of vendor performance during a CIC on a customer's share of category requirements with a focal brand and word-of-mouth incidence following contact. The authors propose customer characteristics and context-specific factors that may relate to differences in the key characteristics of the underlying source model of share of category requirements and word of mouth. The authors then assess the overall importance of the explanatory variables in the source model and simultaneously test for systematic differences related to CIC-specific factors using survey data from more than 1700 CICs that involve more than 60 brands. A key assumption in much prior research that has examined customer-firm interactions is that CIC-specific factors, if they are included at all, create an automatic regularity that must be controlled for. The authors propose and find an additional effect. The responsiveness to factors under a firm's control varies across CICs, and therefore firms that adapt their processing have an advantage. Rather than provide a uniform response to all CICs, the authors' results offer managers several guidelines on how to customize their responses to the various CIC types and how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their firms' CIC management efforts.

TI Optimizing television program schedules using choice modeling
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine the rescheduling of television programs to maximize the total ratings for one network across a week. The key idea is to design a choice experiment in which television programs are rescheduled and presented to respondents. Respondents read these program schedules (much like the regular TV Guide listings) and give their preferences, including not watching any of the listed programs. Because there are potentially billions of possible schedules, the authors give a procedure for designing a fractional factorial experiment that can accommodate both programs of varying length and constraints on eligible program times. The authors also develop a latent class multinomial logit model for modeling program preferences and present a validation of our experimental procedure and the model. They also present an empirical test of the procedure in which they use the model to predict ratings for all the possible program schedules, not just those constituting the choice sets. In this example, the optimum schedule increases the predicted total weekly ratings during prime time by 18% for a network. The projected increase in total weekly ratings is achieved without the network needing to purchase any new programs; all it needs to do is reschedule eight programs in its existing prime-time lineup.

TI Creating local brands in multilingual international markets
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Despite the importance of decisions regarding international brand names, research on brand naming has focused primarily on English name creation. The authors conceptualize the local brand-name creation process in a multilingual international market. The authors present a framework that incorporates (1) a linguistic analysis of three translation methods-phonetic (i.e., by sound), semantic (i.e., by meaning), and phonosemantic (i.e., by sound plus meaning)-and (2) a cognitive analysis focusing on the impact of primes and expectations on consumer name evaluations. Using dual English-and-Chinese brand names, the authors show that the effectiveness of the translation depends on the emphasis of the original English name (versus the Chinese name) and the method of translation used previously for brand names within the same category.

TI Threats to the external validity of brand extension research
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The findings of prior research suggest that a brand's extendibility is constrained by the degree of perceived fit between the brand and extension product categories. However, there are many examples of brands that have been extended successfully into "perceptually distant" domains. Drawing on theories of consumer information processing and product adoption, the authors identify three background traits of prior work that may help explain the discrepancy between prior research and marketplace observation: (1) limited extension information, (2) failure to account for consumers' new product adoption tendencies (i.e., earlier versus later), and (3) single exposure to proposed extensions. In this study, the authors find that the effects of fit disappear when attribute information is added to extension stimuli and are applicable only for later product adopters. The authors also find that perceived fit increases with greater exposure to an extension. Beyond implications for brand extension research, this study underscores the need to recognize that certain research design factors related to external validity, which are often assumed irrelevant, can alter what is held to be true.

TI What we see makes us who we are: Priming ethnic self-awareness and
   advertising response
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors propose that "ethnic self-awareness"-a temporary state during which a person is more sensitive to information related to his or her own ethnicity-moderates consumer response to targeted advertising. Ethnic self-awareness occurs when a person engages in a process of seif-categorization and uses ethnic criteria as the basis for this categorization. The authors hypothesize that "ethnic primes"-visual or verbal cues that draw attention to ethnicity-direct self-categorization and increase ethnic self-awareness. To test these hypotheses, the authors conduct two experiments. Using 109 Asian and Caucasian participants, Experiment I assessed the impact of exposure to an Asian ethnic prime on ethnic self-awareness and on response to targeted television advertising. Exposure to an ethnic prime increased the rate at which participants spontaneously mentioned their ethnicity in self-descriptions (a measure of ethnic self-awareness) and caused participants to respond more favorably to same-ethnicity spokespeople and advertising that targeted their ethnicity. Experiment 2 tested the theory in a print advertising context and extended the design by manipulating the type of ethnic prime participants saw (Asian or Caucasian) and the market that the focal advertisement targeted (Asian or Caucasian). Experiment 2 replicated the findings of Experiment I when the focal advertisement targeted Asians, but not when it targeted Caucasians.

TI The role of market efficiency intuitions in consumer choice: A case of
   compensatory inferences
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors examine consumer inferences about product attributes that are unobservable at the time of the decision. Extant research predicts that in the absence of an explicit correlation between product attributes, consumers will infer that the brand that is superior on the observable attributes is also superior on the unobservable attributes. The authors propose an alternative inference strategy that makes the counterintuitive prediction that the apparently superior brand is inferior on the unobservable attributes. The authors refer to these inferences as "compensatory inferences" and assert that they are associated with consumers' intuitive theories about the competitive nature of a market. In a series of four experiments, the authors examine the occurrence of compensatory inferences and compare them with other inference strategies.

TI Why some new products are morel, successful than others
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Product innovation is increasingly valued as a key component of the sustainable success of a business's operations. As a result, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies directed at explicating the drivers of new product success. To help managers and researchers synthesize this growing body of evidence, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of the new product performance literature. Of the 24 predictors of new product performance investigated, product advantage, market potential, meeting customer needs, predevelopment task proficiencies, and dedicated resources, on average, have the most significant impact on new product performance. The authors also find that the predictor-performance relationships can vary by measurement factor (e.g., the use of multi-item scales, subjective versus objective measures of performance, senior versus project management reporting, time elapsed since product introduction) or contextual factor (e.g., services versus goods, Asian versus North American markets, competition in high-technology versus low-technology markets). They discuss the implications of these findings and offer directions for further research.

TI Modeling hedonic portfolio products: A joint segmentation analysis of
   music compact disc sales
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors present a framework that enables researchers to differentiate better among a wide array of hedonic products. Specifically, the authors define and discuss characteristics of hedonic portfolio products and offer a joint segmentation model that is appropriate for understanding the sales dynamics of this class of products. The model offered in this article can accommodate a large degree of product heterogeneity through product clusters and model covariates. The basic premise is that several generic consumer segments exist and remain fixed across all albums, and each album (or each cluster of similar albums) can be viewed as drawing different proportions from each of these underlying segments. The authors also allow explanatory variables to have a differential impact on both components of the model-that is, accelerating purchase rates within a consumer segment and changing the proportions drawn from each consumer segment by each product cluster-thereby expanding or contracting the potential market size. The authors apply this model to music compact disc sales for 20 different albums and discuss the different effects of radio airplay and holiday buying on sales for a sample in the music industry.

TI Strategic management of expectations: The role of disconfirmation
   sensitivity and perfectionism
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors suggest that people strategically manage-specifically, lower-their expectations to increase future satisfaction. Consumers who are more disconfirmation sensitive, that is, those who are more satisfied (dissatisfied) when a product performs better (worse) than expected, are hypothesized to have lower expectations. In contrast, the authors expect that consumers who are perfectionists will have higher expectations than those who are not. Results from a laboratory experiment and a field study are consistent with the hypotheses. Furthermore, the authors identify a possible third type of expectation ("as-if") that serves as a basis for postpurchase evaluation and provide preliminary evidence that it differs from both will and should expectations.

TI What to say when: Advertising appeals in evolving markets
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors study how ad cues affect consumer behavior in new versus well-established markets. The authors use theoretical insights from consumer information processing to argue that the same ad cues can have different effects on consumer behavior, depending on whether the market is new or old. The authors then test these hypotheses in the context of a toll-free referral service, using a highly disaggregate econometric model of advertising response. The results indicate that argument-based appeals, expert sources, and negatively framed messages are particularly effective in new markets. Emotion-based appeals and positively framed messages are more effective in older markets than in new markets.

TI Understanding what's in a brand rating: A model for assessing brand and
   attribute effects and their relationship to brand equity
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although brand ratings capture the favorability of brand associations, they often do not enable marketing managers to disentangle brand-specific associations from other effects. In this article, the authors present a decompositional model for analyzing brand ratings that addresses this nagging problem and provide insights for understanding the sources of brand equity. Starting with consumers' perceived level of a brand on an attribute, the authors decompose the rating into two components: brand-specific associations and general brand impressions. Brand-specific associations refer to features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand and that differentiate it from the competition. General brand impressions refer to general impressions about the brand that are based on a more holistic view of the brand. In this article, the authors focus on two principal issues: (1) How can the sources of bias that may be present in brand ratings be disentangled? and (2) Do these putatively biasing effects, if present, have any managerial implications for brand equity? The authors demonstrate the properties and advantages of the model in the context of three empirical applications.

TI Designing conjoint choice experiments using managers' prior beliefs
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors provide more efficient designs for conjoint choice experiments based on prior information elicited from managers about the parameters and their associated uncertainty. The authors use a Bayesian design procedure that assumes a prior distribution of likely parameter values and optimizes the design over that distribution. The authors propose a way to elicit prior information from managers and show in Monte Carlo studies that the procedure provides more efficient designs than the current procedures. The authors provide an empirical application, in which they elicit prior information on the parameter values and the associated uncertainty from managers. Here, the Bayesian design provides 30%-50% lower standard errors of the estimates and an expected predictive validity that is approximately 20% higher.

TI Understanding reference-price shoppers: A within- and cross-category
   analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors attempt to draw profiles of reference-price shoppers. Specifically, the authors study how selected factors that affect brand choice are correlated with consumer sensitivity to gains and losses with respect to internal reference prices. They also study the interaction between sociodemographics and gain and loss sensitivity. Furthermore, the authors analyze cross-category correlations in gain and loss sensitivity to shed light on their individual- and category-specific characters. In three categories, the results show significant heterogeneity in loss sensitivity among consumers and indicate that loss sensitivity is greater and more heterogeneous than gain sensitivity. Across categories, the results show that loss-sensitive shoppers are less influenced by past brand use and that both loss- and gain-sensitive shoppers more sensitive to price, display, and feature than the average consumer. Loss-sensitive households tend to be larger, and their heads are less likely to be fully employed, whereas gain-sensitive households have no clear demographic profile. The authors also discuss the limitations of latent-class models in profiling consumer segments and show how these problems are overcome using models with continuous, correlated multivariate distributions.

AB Spillover refers to the extent to which a message influences beliefs related to attributes that are not contained in the message. The authors find that when consumers are not familiar with a brand, negative information spills over to attributes that are associated with the target attribute but not mentioned in the message. However, positive information does not. When consumers like the brand, a spillover occurs for the positive information as well. When consumers are committed to the brand, the spillover of negative information is minimized, but positive information spills over more freely to other associated but unmentioned attributes.

TI The differential impact of goal congruency on attitudes, intentions, and
   the transfer of brand equity
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Various theories suggest that the perceived similarity of objects facilitates the transfer of knowledge, affect, and intentions from one object to the other. However, there is disagreement as to the meaning of similarity and how it should be operationalized among these various theories, and no effort to relate these various measures to one another exists in the literature. In an empirical study, the authors examine the relationships among measures of product similarity in three different contexts: (1) goal-congruent products, (2) moderately goal-incongruent products, and (3) extremely goal-incongruent products. The results of exploratory factor analyses revealed that perceived similarity is a multidimensional construct and that the number and structure of these dimensions of similarity are different when products differ in their degrees of goal congruency. Structural equation analyses of the measures based on a second sample confirmed the structure obtained in the earlier exploratory analyses and demonstrated that brand attitudes and purchase intention exhibit different relationships to the underlying dimensions of similarity in the goal-congruent and goal-incongruent conditions, consistent with expectations based on the theory of goal-derived categorization. The authors discuss implications of these findings for theory and practice.

TI Do we really know how consumers evaluate brand extensions? Empirical
   generalizations based on secondary analysis of eight studies
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate the empirical generalizability of Aaker and Keller's model of how consumers evaluate brand extensions. Various replications have reported different results. Using a comprehensive data set containing the data from the original study and seven replications conducted around the world, the authors undertake a secondary analysis to understand what generalizations emerge. The study has implications for the understanding of how brand extensions are evaluated and how empirical generalizations are made. For brand extensions, Aaker and Keller's model hypothesizes that evaluations of brand extensions are based on the quality of the original brand, the fit between the parent and extension categories, and the interaction of the two. The authors find support for this full model despite published results, including Aaker and Keller's own, that support only some of the hypotheses. The authors find evidence that the level of contribution of each of these components varies by brand and culture. With respect to empirical generalizations, the key implication is that it is premature to make firm conclusions about theory on the basis of only one study.

TI Marketing-mix variables and the diffusion of successive generations of a
   technological innovation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Research addressing the diffusion of successive generations of technological innovations has generally ignored the impact of marketing-mix variables. As a result, there have been several calls for the development of multiple-generation models that incorporate marketing-mix variables. The authors develop a model of first-time sales and subscriptions for successive generations of a technological innovation, which explicitly captures the effects of marketing-mix variables through a proportional hazards framework. The empirical analysis estimates the impact of price for two generations of cellular telephones in a European country. The results suggest that there are important substantive insights to be gained from the parameter estimates for this marketing-mix variable when intergenerational interdependencies are considered. For example, although the time path of the estimated price elasticities in a multiple-gene ration setting closely follows those reported previously for single generations, the authors find evidence of an important interaction in price response across generations. Therefore, empirical estimates in single-generation models may be missing an important part of the pricing equation.

TI Using multimarket data to predict brand performance in markets for which
   no or poor data exist
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors show how multimarket data can be used to make predictions about brand performance in markets for which no or poor data exist. To obtain these predictions, the authors propose a model for market similarity that incorporates the structure of the U.S. retailing industry and the geographic location of markets. The model makes use of the idea that if two markets have the same retailers or are located close to each other, then branded goods in these markets should have similar sales performance (other factors being held constant). In holdout samples, the proposed spatial prediction method improves greatly on naive predictors such as global-market averages, nearest neighbor predictors, or local averages. In addition, the authors show that the spatial model gives more plausible estimates of price elasticities. It does so for two reasons. First, the spatial model helps solve an omitted variables problem by allowing for unobserved factors with a cross-market structure. An example of such unobserved factors is the shelf-space allocations made at the retail-chain level. Second, the model deals with uninformative estimates of price elasticities by drawing them toward their local averages. The authors discuss other substantive issues as well as future research.

TI Search and alignment in judgment revision: Implications for brand
   positioning
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors propose a model of judgment revision, which posits that counterattitudinal challenges to a brand initially trigger a memory search for proattitudinal information about the brand. The proattitudinal information accessible from memory is then aligned with information contained in the challenge in order to assess the diagnosticity of the challenge, that is, how much it "damages" the retrieved brand information. If the challenge is not perceived to be diagnostic, the retrieved brand information is used to defend the previous attitudinal position. If the challenge is perceived to be diagnostic, judgments are revised in direct proportion to the amount of damage identified in the alignment phase. Four experiments test the model's predictions about the influence of abstract versus attribute-specific brand positioning on judgment revision. Consistent with the model's predictions, results show that compared with attribute-specific positioning, abstract positioning will result in less judgment revision when the challenge is specific (e.g., a direct attack about particular attributes of the brand) and the initial brand evaluation is based on limited learning of the positioning information. When the challenge is general (e.g., a blanket, unspecific negative statement about the brand), abstract positioning will result in greater judgment revision than attribute-specific positioning will. The differential effectiveness of abstract versus attribute-specific positioning is mediated by (1) the accessibility in memory of the positioning information at the time of the challenge and (2) the perceived diagnosticity of the challenge after alignment with the retrieved brand information.

TI Extending discrete choice models to incorporate attitudinal and other
   latent variables
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB One of the nagging issues in using discrete choice models is how softer attributes, such as attitudes and perceptions, that are not explicitly manipulated within the context of the choice experiment can be accommodated. In many cases, it is reasonable to expect that the choice of a particular alternative may be influenced by non-product-related attributes. For example, latent attitudes and perceptions may play as much of a role in shaping choice as the attributes that have been manipulated and used to define the alternative offerings. In this article, the authors present several full information models that can accommodate latent variables such as attitudes and satisfaction within the context of binary and multinomial choice models. The models proposed are particularly useful when the focus is on understanding how softer attributes can influence choice decisions. The authors accomplish this by integrating structural equation models within the basic framework of binary and multinomial choice models. Two empirical applications are provided. In addition to illustrating the proposed models, these applications provide insights into the circumstances under which the simultaneous factor-choice modeling approach makes a difference.

In this research, three empirical studies examine how analogical thinking influences the idea-generation stage of the new product development process. The first study uses the verbal protocols of real-world industrial designers to trace the role of analogy in the context of a new product development task, and the second and third studies use an experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of different ideation strategies and conditions. Findings from these studies indicate that the originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes. In addition, these studies reveal a positive relationship between the originality of the product concept and consumers' willingness to pay for it, an important measure in the concept-testing phase of product development.

TI The field behind the screen: Using netnography for marketing research in
   online communities
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The author develops "netnography" as an online marketing research technique for providing consumer insight. Netnography is ethnography adapted to the study of online communities. As a method, netnography is faster, simpler, and less expensive than traditional ethnography and more naturalistic and unobtrusive than focus groups or interviews. It provides information on the symbolism, meanings, and consumption patterns of online consumer groups. The author provides guidelines that acknowledge the online environment, respect the inherent flexibility and openness of ethnography, and provide rigor and ethics in the conduct of marketing research. As an illustrative example, the author provides a netnography of an online coffee newsgroup and discusses its marketing implications.

TI A multiple ideal point model: Capturing multiple preference effects from
   within an ideal point framework
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Previous research has suggested that households and individuals may possess multiple preferences for a given product category. These multiple preferences may be the result of multiple individuals in a household, different uses and usage occasions, and/or variety seeking. As such, single ideal point models that assume a single invariant ideal point may be operating from a false and misleading assumption. We propose a multiple ideal point model to capture these multiple preference effects. The basic premise of the model is that consumers may possess a set of ideal points, each of which represents a distinct preference. At any given purchase occasion, one of these points is "activated" with some probability, and choices are made with respect to its characteristics. In this article, the authors assess the multiple ideal point model and an associated estimation procedure with respect to the model's ability to recover a true choice structure. The authors then empirically test the model on Information Resources Inc. panel data from the powdered soft drink category. The authors discuss the results and introduce directions for further research.

TI Hierarchical Bayes versus finite mixture conjoint analysis models: A
   comparison of fit, prediction, and partworth recovery
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB A study conducted by Vriens, Wedel, and Wilms (1996) and published in Journal of Marketing Research found that finite mixture (FM) conjoint models had the best overall performance of nine conjoint segmentation methods in terms of fit, prediction, and parameter recovery. Since that study, hierarchical Bayes (HB) conjoint analysis methods have been proposed to estimate individual-level partworths and have received much attention in the marketing research literature. However, no study has compared the relative effectiveness of FM and HB conjoint analysis models in terms of fit, prediction, and parameter recovery. To conduct such a comparison, the authors employ the simulation methodology proposed by Vriens, Wedel, and Wilms with some modification. The authors estimate traditional individual-level conjoint models as well. The authors show that FM and HB models are equally effective in recovering individual-level parameters and predicting ratings of holdout profiles. Two surprising findings are that (1) HB performs well even when partworths come from a mixture of distributions and (2) FM produces good parameter estimates, even at the individual level. The authors show that both models are quite robust to violations of underlying assumptions and that traditional individual-level models overfit the data.

TI A simulated annealing heuristic for a bicriterion partitioning problem
   in market segmentation
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB K-means clustering procedures are frequently used to identify homogeneous market segments on the basis of a set of descriptor variables. In practice, however, market research analysts often desire both homogeneous market segments and good explanation of an exogenous response variable. Unfortunately, the relationship between these two objective criteria can be antagonistic, and it is often difficult to find clustering solutions that yield adequate levels for both criteria. The authors present a simulated annealing heuristic for solving bicriterion partitioning problems related to these objectives. A large computational study and an empirical demonstration reveal the effectiveness of the methodology. The authors also discuss limitations and extensions of the method.

TI The customer orientation of service workers: Personality trait effects
   on self- and supervisor performance ratings
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Prior research indicates that market orientation is associated with positive outcomes for firms. For service organizations, a market orientation is implemented largely through individual service workers. The authors investigate the mediational role of customer orientation in a hierarchical model of the influence of personality traits on self-rated and supervisor-rated performance. The results support a partially mediated hierarchical model. Three basic personality traits (emotional stability, agreeability, and the need for activity) account for 39% of the variance in the customer orientation of employees. In turn, the customer orientation measure and conscientiousness account for 26% of the variance in self-rated performance. The customer orientation measure, along with the direct effects of conscientiousness and agreeability, account for 12% of the variance in manager ratings. The authors discuss the results and their implications for marketing researchers and managers.

TI Is the first to market the first to fail? Empirical evidence for
   industrial goods businesses
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB When entering a new market, the first entrant typically faces the greatest market and technological uncertainties. Memorable phrases reflect the associated survival risk, such as "the first to market is the first to fail" and "the pioneer is the one with the arrows in its back." Although research estimates the market pioneer's survival rate, the typical pioneer survival rate has not been compared with that of early followers. The authors' study compares survival rates for 167 first-entrant market pioneers versus 267 early followers. For these industrial goods businesses, 66% of the pioneers versus 48% of the early followers survived at least ten years. The main conclusion is that the pioneer's temporary monopoly over the early followers plus its first-mover advantages typically offset the survival risks associated with market and technological uncertainties. These results are consistent with previous research in the sense that first-mover advantages that increase a pioneer's market share also help protect the pioneer from outright failure.

TI Investigating category pricing behavior at a retail chain
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In studying retailer pricing behavior, researchers typically assume that retailers maximize profits across all brands in a focal product category. In this article, the author attempts to study empirically the extent to which three factors affect retail prices: (1) the effects of payments from manufacturers to the retailer other than regular promotions, as well as the effects of additional costs borne by the retailer for these brands; (2) the retailer's objectives specific to its store brand, such as maximizing store brand share; and (3) the effects of retail competition and store traffic. By specifying a demand function at the brand-chain level for each brand in the product category, the author derives pricing rules for the retailer. The author decomposes the retail price of a brand into effects due to wholesale price, markup (obtained from the demand functions), additional promotional payments, retail competition, and the retailer's objectives for the store brand. The author carries out empirical analysis for a specific product category at a single retail grocery chain. The results indicate that the effects of the three factors vary across brands in the category.

TI Earning the right to indulge: Effort as a determinant of customer
   preferences toward frequency program rewards
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Although frequency programs (FPs) have become ubiquitous in the marketplace and a key marketing-mix tool for promoting customer relationship and loyalty, little is known about the factors that determine how such programs are evaluated by consumers. The authors investigate the impact of the level of effort participants must invest to obtain the reward on the types of rewards they prefer and, consequently, on the decision to join the FP In particular, the authors propose that higher required effort shifts consumer preferences from necessity to luxury rewards, because higher efforts reduce the guilt that is often associated with choosing luxuries over necessities. A series of studies with approximately 3100 consumers demonstrated that (1) higher program requirements shift preferences in favor of luxury rewards, (2) this effect is also observed when consumers choose between luxury and necessity rewards (of the same value) that they themselves proposed, and (3) the effect of program requirements on reward preferences is stronger among consumers who tend to feel guilty about luxury consumption and among those for whom the effort is invested in the context of work rather than pleasure. In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher requirements signal higher value of luxury rewards, the authors show that (1) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer's effort is higher, the shift in preference toward luxuries is still observed and (2) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the FP decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards. The authors discuss the theoretical implications of this research and the practical implications with respect to the design, targeting, and promotion of FPs.

TI Developing synergies between promotions and brands in different
   price-quality tiers
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Brands are promoted in many different ways. In this research, the authors examine synergies between different types of promotions and characteristics of the brands that offer the promotions. Specifically, the authors examine interactions among feature advertising, display, price promotions, and the price-quality tier of the brand offering them. Using both scanner data and experiments, the authors find that high-tier brands benefit more than low-tier brands from price promotions, displays, or feature advertising when these promotional tools are used by themselves. This advantage disappears, however, when certain promotional tools are used in combination with one another. In particular, the authors find that price promotions have a more equal effect on low-tier and high-tier brands when these promotions are offered in settings where comparisons are difficult (end-of-aisle displays or feature advertising). Furthermore, the combined effects of displays and price promotions, or feature advertising and price promotions, are greater on the low-tier brands than on the high-tier brands. The results provide insights into the conditions under which specific marketing tools are most effective for which brands. The authors discuss theoretical implications of the results as they relate to promotions and consumer decision making and outline strategic implications for retailers and manufacturers.

TI Absence makes the mind grow sharper: Effects of element omission on
   subsequent recall
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate the memorial consequences of deliberately omitting crucial elements from an advertisement. Research on the self-generation effect in cognitive psychology indicates that such element omission may actually lead to an improvement in recall. Support for this perspective is obtained in a series of experiments that explores the effects of feature omission in the context of both overt omission (in which the omission is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit omission (in which the omission, though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e.g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the omission of an element related to the brand name. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.

TI Designing loyalty-building programs for packaged goods brands
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors investigate the effects of loyalty programs on loyalty to packaged goods brands. Findings from a series of experiments indicate that the incentive that is offered in a loyalty program is important to whether the program succeeds or fails at building brand loyalty. The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations.

TI Measuring consumers' willingness to pay at the point of purchase
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Economists, psychologists, and marketing researchers rely on measures of consumers willingness to pay (WTP) in estimating demand for private and public goods and in designing optimal price schedules. Existing market research techniques for measuring WTP differ in whether they provide an incentive to consumers to reveal their true WTP and in whether they simulate actual point-of-purchase contexts. The authors present an empirical comparison of several procedures for eliciting WTP that are applicable directly at the point of purchase. In particular, the authors test the applicability of Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) well-known incentive-compatible procedure for assessing the utility of lotteries to measuring consumers' WTP In three studies, the authors explore the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the procedure and show that it yields lower WTP estimates than do non-incentive-compatible methods such as open-ended and double-bounded contingent valuation. They show experimentally that differences in WTP estimates arise from the incentive constraint rather than the cognitive effort required in responding. They also control for strategic response behavior.

TI Bayesian prediction in hybrid conjoint analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The authors propose a general model that includes the effects of discrete and continuous heterogeneity as well as self-stated and derived attribute importance in hybrid conjoint studies. Rather than use the self-stated importances as prior information, as has been done in several previous approaches, the authors consider them data and therefore include them in the formulation of the likelihood, which helps investigate the relationship of self-stated and derived importances at the individual level. The authors formulate several special cases of the model and estimate them using the Gibbs sampler. The authors reanalyze Srinivasan and Park's (1997) data and show that the current model predicts real choices better than competing models do. The posterior credible intervals of the predictions of models with the different heterogeneity specifications overlap, so there is no clear superior specification of heterogeneity. However, when different sources of data are used-that is, full profile evaluations, self-stated importances, or both-clear differences arise in the accuracy of predictions. Moreover, the authors find that including the self-stated importances in the likelihood leads to much better predictions than does considering them prior information.

TI Do we care what others get? A behaviorist approach to targeted
   promotions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Increased access, to individual customers and their purchase histories has led to a growth in targeted promotions, including the practice of offering different pricing policies to prospective, as opposed to current, customers. Prior research on targeted promotions has adopted a tenet of the standard economic theory of choice, whereby what a consumer chooses depends exclusively on the prices available to that consumer. In this article, the authors propose that consumer preference for firms is affected not just by prices the consumers themselves are offered but also by prices available to others. This departure from the conventional strong-rationality, approach to targeted promotion results in a decidedly different optimal policy. Through a laboratory experiment, calibration of a stochastic model, and game-theoretic analysis, the authors demonstrate that ignoring behaviorist effects exaggerates the importance of targeting switchers as opposed to loyals. This occurs,, though with intriguing differences, even when only part. of the market is aware of firms' differing promotional policies. The authors show that both the deal percentage and the proportion of aware consumers affect the optimal strategy of the firm. Furthermore, the authors find that offering lower prices to switchers may not be a sustainable practice in them long run, as information spreads and the,proportion of aware consumers grows. The model cautions practitioners against overpromoting and/or promoting to the wrong segment p and suggests avenues for improving the effectiveness of targeted promotional policies.

TI Price competition under stockpiling and flexible consumption
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Conventional wisdom suggests that the main effect of price promotion is on brand switching (i.e., secondary demand); however, some recent studies demonstrate that the primary demand expansion effect can be considerably larger than previously believed. A significant driver of this primary demand effect is consumer stockpiling in response to price promotions. Indeed, experimental studies have shown that additional inventory on hand can lead to an endogenous increase in consumption. The authors develop a model of price competition between firms in response to the stockpiling and subsequent consumption dynamics of consumers. In this setting, the flexible consumption effect causes more intense price competition, deeper promotions, and an increase in the frequency of promotions. The authors use two years of scanner panel data from eight product categories and 4313 stockkeeping units to test three implications of the theoretical model; they find strong support for each.

TI The effects of temporal consistency of sales promotions and availability
   on consumer choice behavior
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB The importance of consistency of the marketing mix is widely regarded as a key marketing principle. Consistency is commonly understood to apply among marketing mix elements, but it also involves a temporal dimension: Marketing messages and, more generally, marketing mix strategies should achieve some degree of consistency over time. In this article, the authors focus on a particular aspect of marketing mix consistency over time in the context of frequently purchased packaged consumer goods: They investigate the impact of temporal consistency on store promotions, as well as the availability of the product on the shelf, on consumer product evaluations (utilities) and choices. In this specific context, temporal (in)consistency captures the degree of variability of prices, displays, and features, as well as availability over time, for a stockkeeping unit. The authors find that sales promotion mix consistency over time affects both consumer utility mean and scale and thus consumers' choices and brand shares. Lack of sales promotion mix consistency is generally deleterious to consumer brand evaluations through (1) decreases to average valuations and (2) decreases in scale, both of which can lead to decreases in market share.

TI When are stockpiled products consumed faster? A convenience-salience
   framework of postpurchase consumption incidence and quantity
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB When people stockpile products, how do they decide when and how much they will consume? To answer this question, the authors develop a framework that shows how the salience and convenience of products influence postpurchase consumption incidence and quantity. Multiple research methods-including scanner data analysis, a field study, and two laboratory studies-show that stockpiling increases product salience and triggers consumption incidence among high-convenience products. However, when the decision is made to consume a product, stockpiling increases the consumption quantity for both high- and low-convenience products. In addition to providing new insights on how consumers make postpurchase consumption decisions, these results have implications for the debate on the value of promotions that induce stockpiling.

TI Understanding the role of preference revision and concession in group
   decisions
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB In this article, the authors contend that member influence in a group's decision could be decomposed into two distinct elements of preference revision and concession. Using a hierarchical Bayes model of dyadic decision making, the authors show that the degree of preference revision and concession varies across product attributes, individuals, and product categories. The authors demonstrate that converging preferences affect a member's concession, which in turn affects members' satisfaction with the joint decision. More important, a member's satisfaction is higher when his or her concession is reciprocated.

TI Whose culture matters? Near-market knowledge and its impact on foreign
   market entry timing
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Market entry decisions are some of a firm's most important strategic choices. Although some recent studies have begun to consider the impact of learning and experience on foreign market entry, no study has examined the impact of a firm's own operations in similar markets on subsequent entry decisions. In this study, the authors introduce the concept of near-market knowledge to reflect the knowledge firms generate by operating in markets that are culturally and economically similar. The authors compile extensive data on the complete foreign market entries of 19 multinational firms. They use a hazard model on 722 entry observations to evaluate the impact of the dynamic near-market knowledge measures and other economic and cultural variables on foreign market entry timing. In contrast with much previous research, the authors find that cultural distance from the domestic market is not a significant factor. However, the authors find significant effects for the new measures of near-market cultural and economic knowledge and for several other economic variables as well. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for further research and management practice.

TI Can repeating a brand claim lead to memory confusion? The effects of
   claim similarity and concurrent repetition
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Repetition of brand claims is frequently used to promote the learning of brand-related information. Using dual component models of recognition memory, the author examines whether repetition, in the face of repetitions by similar competitors, might paradoxically increase memory confusion. In Experiment 1, the repetition of similar claims of equally familiar competitor brands produced two opposing effects: It increased memory for accurate claim recognition but also elevated brand claim confusion among advertised competitors. The pattern of results was similar when memory was tested a week after the initial exposure. In Experiment 2, in which participants were required to engage in a task designed to promote the "binding" between a brand and its claim, the memory confusion effects of repetition were significantly reduced. Finally, Experiment 3 replicated and generalized these findings by using more realistic stimuli and procedures. Thus, across three studies, the evidence strongly suggests that the confusion-elevating effects of repetition are a result of weak binding between memory for brand and claims.

TI The asymmetric share effect: An empirical generalization on cross-price
   effects
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB Prior empirical literature states that asymmetry in cross-price effect favors the high-share brand. That is, when high-share brands discount, they have a greater impact on low-share brands than the reverse. This conclusion is based on consideration of cross-price elasticities. The authors point out that focusing on cross-price elasticities for assessing asymmetry is inappropriate for determining the incremental profitability from price promotions. Instead, asymmetries should be investigated in absolute cross-price effects, that is, change in market share of a competing brand for a unit price change of the focal brand. The authors theoretically and empirically demonstrate that asymmetry reverses when absolute cross-price effect is considered. That is, the absolute cross-price effect of a price reduction of a low-share brand on the market share or sales of a high-share brand is greater than the reverse. The authors discuss the implications of the findings and future research directions.

TI Assessing when increased media weight of real-world advertisements helps
   sales
SO JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB A prevailing view is that increased media weight for frequently purchased brands in mature product categories usually does not lead to increases in sales. However, the role of advertising executional cues and viewer responses on media weight-induced sales has not yet been examined. The authors find that whether weight helps or has no sales impact depends on the creative characteristics of the advertisements and the responses they evoke in viewers. Study 1 showed that real-world advertisements for frequently purchased brands in mature categories were likely to create greater media weight-induced sales when they used affectively based executional cues. Study 2 found that greater media weight was related to the sales impact of advertisements that evoked positive feelings and failed to evoke negative feelings in viewers. The authors develop hypotheses related to these results within the context of prior work on consumer persuasion (including the elaboration likelihood model), memory processes, and advertising wearout.
