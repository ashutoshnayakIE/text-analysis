AB The use of ethnic imagery in visual identities of brands, such as those
   used by professional sports franchises, has long been a contentious
   issue in American society. This research investigates the oft-voiced
   argument that ethnic brand imagery perpetuates negative stereotypes (a
   claim that has been subject to very little empirical scrutiny) and
   identifies conditions under which encountering such brand imagery
   strengthens both positive and negative implicit stereotypes. Within the
   context of American Indian brand imagery, two laboratory experiments
   (Studies 1 and 2) and a quasi experimental field study (Study 3)
   revealed that the effects of ethnic brand imagery on stereotypes depend
   on the viewer's political identity. Exposure to ethnic brand imagery
   strengthened implicit stereotypes only among more liberal individuals,
   consistent with the idea that liberals tend to hold more malleable
   views. These findings demonstrate measurable negative effects of ethnic
   brand imagery on implicit stereotypes and support the view that the use
   of such imagery can carry detrimental societal consequences. (C) 2016

AB Consumer goods and services have psychological value that can equal or
   exceed their functional value. A burgeoning literature demonstrates that
   one source of value emerges from the capacity for products to serve as a
   psychological salve that reduces various forms of distress across
   numerous domains. This review systematically organizes and integrates
   the literature on the use of consumer behavior as a means to regulate
   self-discrepancies, or the incongruities between how one currently
   perceives oneself and how one desires to view oneself (Higgins, 1987).
   We introduce a Compensatory Consumer Behavior Model to explain the
   psychological consequences of self-discrepancies on consumer behavior.
   This model delineates five distinct strategies by which consumers cope
   with self-discrepancies: direct resolution, symbolic self-completion,
   dissociation, escapism, and fluid compensation. Finally, the authors
   raise critical questions to guide future research endeavors. Overall,
   the present review provides both a primer on compensatory consumer
   behavior and sets an agenda for future research. (C) 2016 Society for

AB Prior research has mainly examined the effect of social exclusion on
   individuals' interactions with other people or on their product choices
   as an instrument to facilitate interpersonal connection. The current
   research takes a novel perspective by proposing that socially excluded
   consumers would be more motivated to establish a relationship with a
   brand (rather than using the brand to socially connect with other
   people) when the brand exhibits human-like features. Based on this
   premise, we predict and find support in three studies that socially
   excluded consumers, compared with non-excluded consumers, exhibit
   greater preference for anthropomorphized brands (studies 1-3). This
   effect is mediated by consumers' need for social affiliation and is
   moderated by the opportunity for social connection with other people
   (study 2). Furthermore, socially excluded consumers differ in the types
   of relationships they would like to build with anthropomorphized brands,
   depending on their attributions about the exclusion. Specifically,
   consumers who blame themselves (others) for being socially excluded show
   greater preference for anthropomorphized partner (fling) brands (study
   3). (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Four experiments reveal that actual taste perception and mental

   other. Experiment 1 shows that similar to actual taste experience,
   simulated taste experience is influenced by a prior actual taste in a
   contrastive manner. Experiment 2 shows that this contrast effect of
   actual taste on taste simulation occurs only when people adopt an
   imagery-based rather than an analytical processing mode. Experiment 3
   demonstrates the bidirectional nature of the current effect and again
   shows that it depends on people's use of mental simulation. Lastly,
   experiment 4 replicates the observed effect in a realistic marketing

AB Because it is harder to justify hedonic purchases than utilitarian
   purchases, it is proposed that promotions will have a stronger positive
   effect on the purchase likelihood of hedonic than utilitarian products.
   This and related propositions are tested in multiple studies using a
   variety of product categories and promotions. The results demonstrate
   that promotions are more effective in driving purchase decisions when:
   (a) the product is hedonic rather than utilitarian; (b) the product is
   framed as more hedonic; and (c) the consumer has a hedonic rather than
   utilitarian consumption goal. Consistent with our conceptualization, the
   enhanced impact of promotions on hedonic purchases is attenuated when:
   (a) the hedonic product is intended as a gift for others; (b) consumers
   can construct justifications for their purchase ahead of time; (c)
   consumers are not accountable for their decisions; and (d) the promotion
   is contingent on purchasing additional product units (i.e., a quantity
   discount like "Buy 10, get 50% off'). Importantly, the present research
   reconciles and explains the seemingly inconsistent prior findings
   regarding the effects of price versus quantity promotions. (C) 2016

AB Although previous research has identified red as the color of
   compliance, the current work proposes that this effect of red may not
   hold under high sensation-seeking propensity conditions. It is argued
   that the color red has the capability to induce arousal, which in turn
   has been shown to enhance a person's default tendencies. Further,
   because high sensation seekers have a higher tendency to react, the
   exposure to the color red for these individuals will increase reactance
   and thereby non-compliant behavior. One field study and two lab
   experiments provide support for this theorizing. The first experiment, a
   field study, examines prank-chatting incidences at a child helpline and
   shows a positive effect of red on such non-compliant behavior.
   Experiment 2 confirms this finding in a controlled lab setting and shows
   that when one has a high sensation-seeking propensity, the color red
   positively affects one's attitude towards non-compliance. The final
   study illuminates the underlying process and explicates the role of
   arousal and reactance in the color non-compliance relationship. Both
   theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Society

   convey information beyond the actual verbal message. In a traditional
   face-to-face conversation, paralanguage, or the ancillary meaning- and
   emotion-laden aspects of speech that are not actual verbal prose, gives
   contextual information that allows interactors to more appropriately
   understand the message being conveyed. In this paper, we conceptualize
   textual paralanguage (TPL), which we define as written manifestations of
   nonverbal audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or
   replace written language and that can be expressed through words,
   symbols, images, punctuation, demarcations, or any combination of these
   elements. We develop a typology of textual paralanguage using data from
   Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We present a conceptual framework of
   antecedents and consequences of brands' use of textual paralanguage.

   when it is communicated in an implicit manner, they express preferences
   for conspicuous consumption. However, this may not always hold true. In
   the present research, we put forward a theoretical framework explaining
   that exclusion effects depend on the extent to which exclusion is
   communicated in a culturally normative or counter-normative manner,
   rather than whether it is communicated in an explicit or implicit
   manner. We show that exclusion communicated in a cultural norm-congruent
   manner produces preferences for helping, whereas exclusion communicated
   in a cultural norm-incongruent manner produces preferences for
   conspicuous consumption. We further show that the differential needs
   self-esteem and power threatened by normative and counter-normative
   exclusion explain these distinct preferences. (C) 2016 Society for

AB Prior research suggests that consumers experience psychological
   discomfort when they make a choice under attitudinal ambivalence. The
   research reported here examines systematic cross-cultural variations in
   psychological discomfort as a function of dialectical thinking and
   attitudinal ambivalence in the context of choice. It shows that compared
   to nondialectical (Western) consumers, dialectical (Eastern) consumers
   experience less psychological discomfort when they hold bivalent
   evaluations of the focal object, but more psychological discomfort when
   they hold univalent evaluations (Study 1). It also identifies
   "uncertainty about making the correct choice" as the underlying process
   that accounts for these findings (Study 2). In addition, this research
   explores the downstream effects of psychological discomfort on choice
   deferral in the context of free choice (Study 3) and preference reversal
   in the context of forced choice (Study 4). Contributions to and

AB Consumers often encounter information about new brands that is not

   browsing might expose consumers to information that is unknown for an
   option they already placed in their shopping cart. How might preference
   strength affect their reactions to such missing information on their
   prior choices? Much research suggests that consumers with strong prior
   preferences are likely to employ motivated reasoning to bolster and
   retain the preliminary choice. However, we document a heretofore
   unexamined condition under which those with relatively stronger prior
   preferences for an incumbent are more likely to abandon it than those
   with weaker prior preferences. We argue that this occurs because those
   with relatively stronger (vs. weaker) prior preferences experience more
   cognitive dissonance when information on new attributes is missing on

AB We investigated a novel avenue for buffering against threats to meaning
   frameworks: vintage consumption. Although the appeal of vintage goods,
   defined as previously owned items from an earlier era, is strong and
   growing, this paper is among the first to examine the possible
   psychological ramifications of vintage consumption. Six studies found
   that vintage items mitigated the typical reactions to meaning threats.
   Four of these studies also showed that vintage consumption facilitates
   mental connections among the past, present, and future. As a result,
   people whose meaning structures had been threatened, for example, by
   being reminded of their own eventual death, preferred vintage products
   more than others who had not experienced a meaning threat, and more than
   similar non-vintage products. These findings suggest that meaning
   disruptions stimulate a desire for intertemporal connections, a desire
   that vintage products as existing and continuing symbols of bygone eras
   seem to satisfy. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Within close relationships individuals feel a variety of emotions toward

   introduce the concept of oppositional brand choice, which we define as
   occurring when individuals choose a brand for themselves that is in
   opposition to the one they believe their partner prefers. Importantly,
   we posit that this effect is specific to individuals who are low in
   relationship power. Across several studies, including a subliminal
   priming lab study, we find that people who are lower in relationship
   power and are frustrated with their partner make significantly more
   oppositional brand choices. Further, we find that this effect is not due

AB Jealous individuals often harbor feelings of aggression toward both
   their relationship partner and their rivals. However, jealousy can also
   have quite different effects that have implications for people's product
   preferences. Five experiments converge on the conclusion that jealousy
   induces a desire to recapture attention from one's partner and that this
   desire generalizes to unrelated situations in which the partner is not
   involved. Thus, jealousy increases people's preferences for
   attention-grabbing products and this is true even when the public
   display of the products could bring negative attention. The effect of
   jealousy only occurs when the products are consumed in public. Finally,
   the influence of jealousy on product evaluations is distinguished from
   that of other negative emotions such as envy and feelings of
   powerlessness. (C) 2016 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB Drawing on recent evidence suggesting that beliefs about contagion
   underlie the market for celebrity-contaminated objects, the current work
   investigates how people can make biased dispositional judgments about
   consumers who own such objects. Results from four experiments indicate
   that when a consumer comes in contact with a celebrity-contaminated
   object and behaves in a manner that is inconsistent with the traits
   associated with that celebrity, people tend to make more extreme
   judgments of them. For instance, if the celebrity excels at a particular
   task, but the target who has come into contact with the
   celebrity-contaminated object performs poorly, people reflect more
   harshly on the target. This occurs because observers implicitly expect
   that a consumer will behave in a way that is consistent with the traits
   associated with the source of contamination. Consistent with the law of
   contagion, these expectations only emerge when contact occurs. Our
   findings suggest that owning celebrity contaminated objects signals
   information about how one might behave in the future, which consequently
   has social implications for consumers who own such objects. (C) 2016 The

AB Prior research documents that individuals may categorize themselves
   along a hierarchy of social identities and that their subsequent
   behavior is guided by whichever identity is salient at the moment. The
   current research investigates how activating one's social identity at
   different breadth levels influences consumers' subjective knowledge and
   the consequences for product choice. We propose and document that
   consumers will perceive that they have greater knowledge and thus prefer
   more advanced product options when their broad identity rather than
   narrow identity is salient (experiment 1). We also rule out simple
   categorization mindset and construal level as the alternative
   explanations of the identity breadth effect (experiments 2A and 2B)..
   Moreover, our findings suggest that the effect of identity breadth on
   subjective knowledge will lessen for consumers with high self-esteem
   (experiment 3) and will reverse when the product domain is highly
   relevant to the narrow identity (experiment 4). Both theoretical
   contributions and marketing implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Society

   across 73 studies examining child outcomes, including 173 unique
   consumer socialization dependent variables ranging from understanding
   advertising practices to weight status to theft among approximately

   to the consumer socialization literature. It systematically confirms the
   influence that parental Restrictiveness (relative to Permissiveness) has
   on raising children adept at positively interacting and avoiding
   negative interactions with the marketplace and related environments.
   Also, this meta-analysis supports prior literature's depiction of the
   Authoritative parenting style as especially important to these positive
   interactions with the marketplace, in particular among older children
   and psychosocial-type outcomes. Finally, this research is the first to
   provide a comprehensive confirmation of differences in child thinking,

AB Recent research on the unit effect has suggested that consumers tend to
   ignore relevant unit information and over-rely on numeric magnitudes in
   judgments (e.g., perceiving the difference between 700 and 900 on a
   1000-point quality scale to be larger than the difference between 7 and
   9 on a 10-point scale). The current work investigates the nature of the
   unit effect by studying the role of different modes of evaluation, and
   types of information processing, on the unit effect. Specifically, three
   studies demonstrate that the unit effect occurs when options are
   evaluated simultaneously and attenuated when options are evaluated
   sequentially. The current article builds on research concerning
   comparative versus selective information processing. It demonstrates
   that, when information is processed in a comparative rather than
   selective manner, common elements in the decision (i.e., units) are more
   likely to be edited out, resulting in the unit effect. (C) 2016 Society

   dispositional trait (Studies 1 and 3) and when it is situationally
   induced (Study 2). We also identify an intervention to increase new
   product acceptance based on the idea that new products threaten one's
   sense of control. Specifically, framing new products as potentially
   enhancing one's sense of control increases acceptance of new products by
   those high in desire for control (Study 3). This finding offers some

   questions. Specifically, we consider 1) how the interplay between the
   tightness/looseness of a culture and its effect on consumer behavior can
   be a bidirectional relationship, 2) how variances in T-L in different
   consumption subcultures and aspects of society (e.g., economic,
   political) can impact consumer behavior, 3) how the examination of T-L
   at different stages in the consumption process is a relevant and
   important question to consider, and 4) how T-L may contribute to further

AB Research shows that assertive ads, which direct consumers to take
   specific actions (e.g., Visit us; Just do it!), are ineffective due to
   reactance. However, such ads remain prevalent. We reexamine assertive
   ads, showing that their effectiveness depends on consumers' relationship
   with the advertising brand. Across studies, we compare committed and
   uncommitted consumers' reactions to assertive ads. We find that because
   committed (vs. uncommitted) brand relationships involve stronger
   compliance norms, assertive ads create greater pressure to comply for
   committed consumers. Specifically, we propose and show that committed
   consumers anticipate feeling guilty if they ignore an assertive message,
   creating pressure to comply. Pressure to comply increases reactance,
   which paradoxically reduces compliance, ultimately leading to decreased
   ad and brand liking as well as decreased monetary allocations to the
   brand. Our results show the perils that assertive ads pose for marketers
   and their most valuable customers. (C) 2017 Society for Consumer

AB We review a growing body of research in consumer behavior that has
   examined when consumers humanize brands by perceiving them as like, part
   of, or in a relationship with themselves. One research stream shows that
   sometimes consumers perceive brands as having human-like forms, minds,
   and personality characteristics. A second stream identifies ways that a
   consumer perceives a brand as being congruent with or connected to the
   self. Finally, a third highlights that consumers can view brands in ways
   that are analogous to the types of relationships they have with people.
   We review research in these three areas and point out connections among
   these research streams. In part, we accomplish this by showing that
   factors associated with the SEEK model, which are designed to explain
   anthropomorphic tendencies, are also relevant to other ways of
   humanizing brands. We identify major propositions derived from this
   research and several areas for which additional research is needed. We

AB Previous cross-cultural research in the field of consumer behavior has
   focused almost exclusively on cultural values. In this article, we
   expand on this tradition by integrating research on tightness-looseness
   (TL)-the strength of social norms and tolerance for deviance-into
   consumer behavior research. We first examine how TL influences
   persuasion in advertising, suggesting that advertising themes in loose
   cultures will focus on the promotion of ideals, permissiveness, and norm
   deviance, whereas advertising themes in tight cultures will emphasize
   prevention focus, uniformity, and norm abidance. Next, we examine
   brand-consumer relationships and product diffusion and discuss how they
   may vary across tight and loose cultures. Finally, we explore the
   implications of TL for consumer well-being by examining different
   strategies for encouraging healthy decision-making across tight and
   loose cultures. Taken together, the integration of TL and CB research
   constitutes an exciting frontier for theory, research, and practice. (C)

   for persuading people who feel socially excluded to behave in ways that
   benefit individual and social wellbeing, regardless of future connection
   possibilities. The authors suggest that socially excluded (included)
   consumers tend to rely on affect (cognition) in processing information,
   and to consequently prefer persuasive messages based on feelings
   (reasons). The effect occurs because people tend to ruminate about
   exclusionary events, which depletes self-regulatory resources. Thus,
   distraction that interferes with rumination can mitigate the social
   exclusion effect on affective processing. The authors present findings
   from five studies across various paradigms promoting personal and social
   wellbeing (i.e., donating blood, recycling, and consuming healthful

AB This research considers how common perceptions of liberals' generosity
   can be harnessed for increasing donations. Given conservatives' greater
   tendency to conform to group norms than liberals, we theorize that
   conformity tendencies can increase donations by conservatives when
   accountable to a liberal audience who share a salient identity.
   Specifically, conservatives donate more when they are accountable to a
   liberal audience with whom they have a salient shared identity (Study 1)
   due to their motivation for social approval (Studies 3 and 4). However,
   if the donation context activates political identity (Studies 2 and 3)
   or if the unifying social identity is not salient (Study 4),
   accountability does not impact donation decisions. Notably, liberals do
   not alter their behavior, ruling out alternative explanations for the
   pattern of conformity. This research provides insight into the distinct
   role of accountability for conservatives and importance of audience
   characteristics for conformity. Though both liberals and conservatives
   can be generous, this research demonstrates how conformity can be used
   to increase charitable giving among conservatives. (C) 2017 Society for

AB Researchers and policy-makers are increasingly interested in the effects
   of pro-environmental tax incentives on consumer responses. However, it
   is unknown whether consumers' responsiveness to pro-environmental taxes
   depends on cognitive ability. We report a natural experiment study, in
   which a pro-environmental tax was introduced in Finland, providing an
   economic benefit for cars with lower CO2 emissions. We examine 140,000
   car acquisitions by male consumers, whose intelligence had been tested
   by Finnish Defense Forces. The results show that the CO2 emissions of
   cars acquired by consumers with higher intelligence dropped more after
   the introduction of the tax than the emissions of cars of consumers with
   lower intelligence. Specifically, intelligence had both a direct effect
   on responsiveness to the pro-environmental tax, and an indirect effect
   via income. The effect was more pronounced for numeric intelligence than
   verbal and spatial logic intelligence and of equal size as that of
   income and other demographics. This implies that intelligence is an
   empirically as well as theoretically relevant variable to study as a
   moderator to choices that are simultaneously pro-environmental and
   economical. (C) 2017 Society for Consumer Psychology. Published by

AB This research examines when and how consumers' product attitudes and
   their subsequent word-of-mouth behaviors are impacted by negative
   information about a brand that is associated with their social group. We
   find that negative information about an in-group brand threatens the
   in-group members' social identity, which in turn results in derogation
   of the threatening out-group's product. Importantly, we identify that
   the communication source of the negative information determines whether
   a threat to social identity will be realized. The out-group product
   derogation effect is observed only when the communication of the
   negative information comes from an out-group (vs. in-group) source.
   Finally, we provide evidence for our proposed mechanism by showing that
   a group affirmation exercise mitigates the out-group product derogation
   effect we have identified. (C) 2017 Society for Consumer Psychology.

AB Sentimental value is the value derived from an emotionally-laden item's
   associations with significant others, or special events or times in
   one's life. The present research demonstrates that when faced with the
   choice between sentimentally valuable gifts and gifts with superficial
   attributes that match the preferences of the recipient, givers give the
   latter much more often than recipients would prefer to receive such
   gifts. This asymmetry appears to be driven by givers feeling relatively
   certain that preference-matching gifts will be well-liked by recipients,
   but relatively uncertain that the same is true for sentimentally
   valuable gifts. Three studies demonstrate this gift-giving mismatch and
   validate the proposed mechanism across a variety of gift-giving
   occasions and giver-receiver relationship types. The contribution of
   these findings to the gift-giving literature, as well as directions for
   future research, are discussed. (C) 2017 Society for Consumer

AB Materialism has been examined in many social science disciplines from
   multiple perspectives. This review synthesizes this extensive literature
   into two organizing frameworks that describe how materialism develops in
   children and how materialism is reinforced and perpetuated in adulthood.
   The major components of the developmental model are the daily event
   cycle, developmental tasks, cultural influence, and family environment,
   all of which interact to influence how materialistic a child becomes.
   The reinforcement model describes how personal qualities that
   materialists tend to possess make them more vulnerable to threats in
   daily events, resulting in psychological discomfort. The desire to
   reduce this discomfort, in conjunction with the transformative powers
   that materialists ascribe to acquisition, results in actions and
   outcomes that reinforce materialistic tendencies. Suggestions for
   furthering the study of materialism are also included. (C) 2017 Society

   and customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction and politically motivated
   boycotts. I conclude that the theory and practice of consumer psychology
   will be enriched by taking into account ideological asymmetries and the
   ways in which human behavior both reflects and gives rise to left right
   divergence in political orientation not only in terms of beliefs,
   opinions, and values but also in terms of underlying psychological

   This approach needs to be balanced by consideration of the power of the

   ideology (liberalism vs. conservatism) and its association with personal

   Jost's arguments and data are very compelling and will inspire consumer
   psychologists to do more research in the political domain. To enable
   this goal further, we complement the target article by focusing on
   partisanship, another major determinant of political judgments and
   decisions. Whereas political ideology refers to people being more
   liberal or conservative, partisanship refers to how strongly people
   identify with a specific political party (e.g., Republicans or
   Democrats). In reviewing the literature on partisanship, we concentrate
   on voting behaviors and attitudes, an area not addressed by Jost, but of
   great importance for consumer psychologists given the large expenditures
   on political advertising. Adding to Jost's discussion of the link
   between political ideology and systematic processing, we examine the
   interplay between these two constructs and partisanship. (C) 2017

   thoughtful commentaries on a target article in which I summarized
   several lines of research in political psychology on
   liberal-conservative differences in personality, cognition, motivation,
   values, and neurological structures and functions (Jost, 2017a). I begin
   by correcting a possible misconception, namely that the theory of
   political ideology as motivated social cognition cannot explain dynamic
   shifts in ideological affinities; on the contrary, we have demonstrated
   that "top-down" situational as well as "bottom-up" dispositional
   processes work in conjunction to produce ideological outcomes, and this
   is why tailored forms of political persuasion can be highly effective in
   producing change. Next I describe additional evidence (including
   previously unpublished evidence) bearing on ideological symmetries and
   asymmetries with respect to emotion, partisanship, social
   identification, motivated reasoning, social network structure, and
   political trust. I end by asking consumer psychologists for their
   continued collaboration in addressing profound challenges associated
   with understanding and reconciling sources of ideological divergence not
   only for the sake of research in behavioral science but also for the
   smooth functioning of democratic society. (C) 2017 Society for Consumer

AB Six experiments converged on the conclusion that consumers' physical

   crash can influence their expectations that there would be survivors of
   a real-life airplane accident, and being close to the description of a
   commercial product can influence beliefs that the product would be
   effective. These and other effects are mediated by the vividness of the
   mental image that participants form on the basis of the information.
   Consequently, the effects were attenuated when participants are under
   high cognitive load or when the verbal description lacks the detail
   necessary for forming a clear mental image. Alternative interpretations

AB Why sexual assaults and car accidents are associated with the
   consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AMED) is still unclear.
   In a single study, we show that the label used to describe AMED
   cocktails can have causal non-pharmacological effects on consumers'
   perceived intoxication, attitudes, and behaviors. Young men who consumed
   a cocktail of fruit juice, vodka, and Red Bull felt more intoxicated,
   took more risks, were more sexually self-confident, but intended to wait
   longer before driving when the cocktail's label emphasized the presence
   of the energy drink (a "Vodka-Red Bull cocktail") compared to when it
   did not (a "Vodka" or "Exotic fruits" cocktail). Speaking to the process
   underlying these placebo effects, we found no moderation of experience
   but a strong interaction with expectations: These effects were stronger
   for people who believe that energy drinks boost alcohol intoxication and
   who believe that intoxication increases impulsiveness, reduces sexual
   inhibition, and weakens reflexes. These findings have implications for
   understanding marketing placebo effects and for the pressing debate on
   the regulation of the marketing of energy drinks. (C) 2017 Society for

AB Do people judge others based on the brands they use? Prior research
   finds evidence to this effect, yet we argue this phenomenon is far from
   universal. Drawing on research on implicit self-theories, we find that
   only entity (but not incremental) theorists are prone to judging people
   based on their brand use (Studies 1 and 2). We show that entity
   theorists infer that people use brands to signal who they are to others,
   thereby forming perceptions of these people based on the personality of
   the brands they use, but incremental theorists are reluctant to make
   inferences about brand users' signaling motives (Studies 3, 4, and 5).
   When tendencies to make signaling inferences are reduced, entity
   theorists no longer judge people based on their brand use (Studies 3 and
   4). Furthermore, even incremental theorists judge people based on their
   brand use when given the information that their brand use is not driven
   by situational forces, but is potentially driven by a signaling
   motivation (Study 5).

   propose that brand flirting is exciting, and that when consumers flirt
   with a brand other than their typically preferred brand in the same
   product category, they can transfer this excitement to their preferred
   brand-resulting in even greater love and desire for it. Consistent with
   this conceptual account, we demonstrate that this brand flirting effect
   is mediated by excitement. Moreover, the brand flirting effect is most
   likely to emerge under conditions that facilitate arousal transfer: when
   consumers are highly committed to their preferred brand, and when the
   brand with which consumers flirt is similar to their preferred brand.

   sharing through these channels? We demonstrate that one of the most
   popular features of online social networks, microblogging (e.g.,
   tweeting or sharing Facebook status updates), is driven in part by its
   undirected nature. Microblogging allows people to simultaneously express
   themselves to a large number of potential communication partners without
   having to address anyone in particular. As a result, this communication
   channel is particularly valued when people feel socially apprehensive;
   it allows them to reach out without having to impose communication and
   potentially bother anyone in particular. These findings shed light on
   one reason why people use online social networks and provide insight
   into the value of undirected communication.

AB When faced with prosocial requests, consumers face a difficult decision
   between taking on the request's burden or appearing unwarm (unkind,
   uncaring). We propose that the desire to refuse such requests while
   protecting a morally warm image leads consumers to under-represent their
   competence. Although consumers care strongly about being viewed as
   competent, five studies showed that they downplayed their competence to
   sidestep a prosocial request. This effect occurred across both
   self-reported and behavioral displays of competence. Further, the
   downplaying competence effect only occurred when facing an undesirable
   prosocial request, not a similarly undesirable proself request. The
   final studies showed that people specifically downplayed competence and
   not warmth. We further distinguished between social warmth (e.g., humor)
   and moral warmth (e.g., kindness), showing that when competence, social
   warmth, and moral warmth were all requisite skills for a prosocial task,
   people downplayed competence and social warmth more than moral warmth.
   These findings underscore that although people care strongly about being
   viewed as competent, they willingly trade off competence evaluations if
   evaluations of warmth-particularly moral warmth-are at risk.

AB Our research explores connections between a fundamental element of
   visual design, namely symmetry, and consumer inferences regarding brand
   personality. In contrast to prior work focused on broad affective
   responses, we propose that symmetry plays an additional, nuanced role in
   the communication of brand personality. Results of four experiments
   reveal that asymmetry in visual brand elements is associated by
   consumers with brand excitement, and that the effect is driven in part
   by the experience of subjective arousal. These findings contribute to
   growing interest in visual design and consumer processing, while
   extending current understanding regarding the communication of brand
   personality.

   We find converging evidence for this prediction in both controlled
   experiments (studies 1 and 3) and in a field study (study 2), when using
   ethnic backgrounds as a proxy for participants' choice freedom needs
   (study 1), when directly measuring these needs (study 2), and when

AB Confirmatory information processing (i.e., information distortion) is a
   robust phenomenon with no known mitigation. This research proposes that
   information distortion might be mitigated by disrupting its driver,
   namely, the need for cognitive consistency. Priming a counterarguing
   mindset should induce people to refute their emerging preferences,
   thereby disrupting the operation of cognitive consistency. Five studies
   confirm this prediction. Study 1 demonstrates that priming a
   counterarguing mindset decreases information distortion. Studies 2 and 3
   replicate Study 1 and further show that the influence of a head start on
   choice diminishes when counterarguing is primed. Study 4 shows that
   priming counterarguing inhibits consistency-related concepts. Finally,
   Study 5 demonstrates that counterarguing not only reduces distortion but
   also yields reduced commitment to the preferred alternative.

   name products, their evaluations of those products increase (e.g.,

   name fit and creativity as well as subsequent psychological ownership
   drive this effect. We also demonstrate that the naming effect is quite

AB According to a social rank hypothesis, consumers who live in regions
   with higher income inequality will show greater interest in, and
   attention toward, positional goods and high-status brands that serve a
   social signaling role. We analyze millions of posts on the microblogging
   platform Twitter for mentions of high-and low-status brands. We find
   that luxury brands such as "Louis Vuitton" and "Rolex" are more
   frequently mentioned in tweets originating from US states, counties, and
   major metropolitan areas with higher levels of income inequality. In
   contrast, mentions of everyday brands such as "Walmart" or "Kmart" are
   more frequent in regions with a more equal distribution of income. Using
   sentiment analysis, we find higher valence (positivity) and arousal
   (excitement) for tweets that both mention high-status brands and
   originate from regions with high levels of income inequality. These
   results corroborate the social rank hypothesis, showing that more
   psychological resources are allocated to positional consumption when the
   income gap between the rich and the poor is larger.

AB Decisions about paying taxes represent one of the most common moral
   quandaries faced by citizens. In the present research, we argue that
   taxpayer compliance can be raised by increasing "voice": allowing
   taxpayers to express non-binding preferences about the way their taxes
   are used. We first test for effects of preference expression on tax
   compliance with a tax in a laboratory setting. Here, we find that
   allowing participants to express non-binding preferences over tax
   spending priorities leads to a 16% increase in compliance. A follow-up
   online study tests this treatment with a simulation of paying US federal
   taxes. Allowing taxpayers to express their preferences on the
   distribution of government spending reduces the stated take-up rate of a
   questionable tax loophole by 15%. A third experiment shows that this
   effect only occurs when taxpayers have voice in spending on preferred
   tax categories, allocating tax dollars across disliked spending
   categories increased neither feelings of voice nor likelihood of
   payment.

AB The standard economic model assumes that demand is weakly decreasing in
   price. While empirical evidence shows that this is true for most price
   levels, it might not hold for the price of zero, where social norms are
   not entirely compatible with the self-maximizing economic agent. A set
   of experiments shows that switching from a low price to a price of zero
   has two effects on behavior: First, in accordance with the economic
   theory, more people demand the product. Second, whereas in the low price
   case some individuals demand high quantities of the product, in the zero
   price case most people take only one unit of the product. As a result,
   lowering the price to zero may lead to a net decrease in the total
   amount demanded in the market. We further show that polite priming
   results in higher demand than ethical priming in both zero price and 1
   empty set conditions.

AB Why do some consumers find a consumption activity appealing while others
   see it as morally appalling? A series of five experiments in two
   different morally ambiguous contexts shows that differences in social
   identity strength can in part explain discrepant reactions to the very
   same consumption experience. Consumers who identify weakly (vs.
   strongly) with the people most related to the consumption environment
   are less likely to question the experience on moral grounds. As a
   result, they are more likely to choose a morally ambiguous consumption
   experience or to act in a morally ambiguous manner. The impact of social
   identity strength on consumer preference vanishes when the consumption
   experience is morally neutral or when all consumers are prompted to
   judge the experience on moral grounds. Statistical analyses based on
   post hoc justifications provide further evidence for the mediating role
   of moral considerations.

AB Although prior research suggests that people should not prefer random
   chance to determine their outcomes, we propose that in the context of
   prosocial requests, a contingent of people prefer to rely on chance. We
   argue that this is because they are conflicted between losing resources
   (e.g., time, money) and losing moral self-regard. Across five studies,
   in both choices with binary outcomes (whether to volunteer) and ranges
   of outcomes (how much to donate), some people preferred to be randomly
   assigned an outcome rather than to make their own choices. This did not
   negatively affect prosocial behavior in binary choices and improved
   prosocial behavior in choices with a range of outcomes. We also found
   that the preference for a random outcome was stronger when participants
   felt particularly conflicted. Furthermore, we examined precisely who
   sorted into the random option. Importantly, choosing the random option
   decreased moral self-reproach, thus increasing consumer welfare. Our
   findings speak to consumers' psychological experience of prosocial
   requests and suggest an intervention that may increase consumer welfare
   and prosocial behavior.

AB Moral decisions in the marketplace largely depend on consumers' own
   behavioral history. Psychology literature distinguishes two possible
   routes for consumers' sequential moral decision making: moral balancing
   and moral consistency. Moral balancing refers to consumers' deviation
   from the moral stance reflected in their past decisions; moral
   consistency implies that consumers repeat their prior moral and immoral
   decisions. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, four experimental studies
   affirm that balancing effects occur for consumers with a strong
   promotion focus, but consistency is more pronounced for
   prevention-focused consumers; the studies also elucidate the processes
   underlying these effects. In addition, the promotion-balancing effect,
   but not the prevention-repetition effect, disappears if the second
   decision is unambiguously moral or immoral. These findings contribute to
   a better understanding of morality in the marketplace by showing that
   the prevention-repetition effect from psychology literature arises in
   consumption situations, and the promotion-balancing effect emerges as a
   new consumer behavior phenomenon.

AB Corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts are known to affect firm
   and societal outcomes, but little is known about their effects on
   consumer well-being. We address this research gap by investigating
   whether consumers who have integrated their self-schema with a brand's
   schema (i.e., high self-brand overlap consumers) vicariously balance
   their moral behavior against a brand's CSR efforts. Specifically, we
   propose that a brand's socially responsible behavior can negatively
   influence the moral behavior of high self-brand overlap consumers
   (vicarious moral licensing), while a brand's less socially responsible
   behavior can positively influence the moral behavior of these consumers
   (vicarious moral cleansing). Further, we do not predict or observe these
   effects among low self-brand overlap consumers, given their lack of
   psychological identification with the CSR brand. Across four
   experiments, we demonstrate the vicarious moral balancing effect and
   show process evidence for the potential role of pride (guilt) in driving
   vicarious moral licensing (cleansing) behaviors. Importantly, we also
   demonstrate two potential methods to eliminate the vicarious moral
   licensing effect when firms conduct CSR efforts.

AB Consumers are frequently bombarded with a myriad of marketing tactics.
   One tactic regularly employed by thrift-oriented brands is to highlight
   low prices, discounts, and sales promotions. When consumers encounter
   these low-price signals, they may adopt a price conscious mentality,
   that is, a singular focus on getting the cheapest deal. A price
   conscious mentality is likely beneficial for consumers, as it helps them
   save money. However, it is also possible that it has negative
   implications, particularly for how consumers perceive and interact with
   other human beings in the marketplace, such as customer service
   employees. The current research addresses this issue by investigating
   how consumers' price conscious mentality impacts their perceptions of
   employees' humanity. Results from four studies demonstrate that a price
   conscious mentality can lead consumers away from fully recognizing the
   human qualities of employees. The findings also suggest that this subtle
   form of dehumanization can result in harsher treatment of employees when
   they provide less than satisfactory service.

AB Consumers often adopt a goal to choose "the best" option: be it the best
   value for their money, the product with the highest quality, or the
   product that offers the best match to their idiosyncratic preferences.
   Prior work has characterized this orientation as a "maximizing mindset,"
   and has demonstrated that the adoption of a maximizing mindset can lead
   to both positive and negative consequences for the self. However, to
   date, little is known about if a maximizing mindset might have
   consequences beyond the self (i.e., for others and/or society). The
   current article addresses this gap by demonstrating that consumers who
   adopt a maximizing mindset (vs. a neutral mindset) are subsequently more
   likely to engage in immoral behaviors. Further, we demonstrate that this
   effect occurs because a maximizing mindset activates cognitions related
   to scarcity. In doing so, the current research offers a more nuanced
   understanding of the psychological and behavioral consequences of a
   maximizing mindset and identifies a maximizing mindset as an antecedent
   to cognitions related to scarcity and immoral behaviors.

   highlight the infectious nature of counterfeiting: Perceiving a product

AB People often form intentions but fail to follow through on them.
   Mounting evidence suggests that such intention-action gaps can be
   narrowed with prompts to make concrete plans about when, where, and how
   to act to achieve the intention. In this paper, we pushed the notion of
   plan-concreteness to test the efficacy of a prompt under a minimalist
   automated calling setting, where respondents were only prompted to
   indicate a narrower duration within which they intent to act. In a field
   experiment, this planning prompt significantly helped people to pay
   their past dues and get out of debt delinquency. These results suggest
   that minimalist automatic planning prompts are a scalable,
   cost-effective intervention.

AB While there is an ample amount of consumer behavior research that
   recruits processing fluency as an explanatory construct, the question
   how to best measure the fluency experience has received little
   attention. Therefore, there is a lack of consistency in measuring the
   construct, particularly with regard to the use of single-item versus
   multi-item measures. The current research, thus, aims to investigate how
   processing fluency can be consistently measured across different
   experimental fluency manipulations and which type of measure has the
   highest validity. Based on classic scale development procedures, we
   propose a reliable and valid multi-item measure and compare this measure
   against a single-item measure in terms of predictive validity. We show
   that both measures mediate the effect of five established fluency
   manipulations and that the single-item measure is sufficient. In
   addition to providing a measure for future research that can be adapted
   to different empirical settings, we provide empirical evidence on the
   replicability of fluency effects and on the theoretical conjecture that
   people have a uniform fluency experience across different manipulations
   of fluency.

AB People frequently observe others' consumption, making inferences about
   both the consumer and the consumed brands. Although these observations
   are often beneficial for brands, this research demonstrates that
   observing luxury brand consumers whose consumption arose from unearned
   (vs. earned) financial resources reduces observers' brand attitudes when
   observers place a high value on fairness. When fairness values are high,
   observers do not perceive luxury brand consumers who use unearned (vs.
   earned) consumption resources as prestigious, and in turn, lower
   prestige perceptions adversely affect observers' brand evaluations for
   luxury brands. Consistent with our theorizing regarding the signaling of
   prestige, the joint effect of consumers' consumption resources and
   observers' fairness values on observers' brand attitudes does not hold
   for nonluxury brands, which are not associated with prestige and thereby
   are not denigrated when the consumer is not perceived as prestigious.
   This research sheds light on the role of moral values in marketplace
   judgments of luxury consumption and brand attitude by considering the
   influence of consumption resources on observers' judgments.

AB Building on the notion that cognitive processes vary across social

   turn affects consumer judgments. In doing so, we employ service failure
   domains as a way to understand social class effects. Across four
   studies, we show that, when faced with a failure incident occurring in
   one service dimension (e.g., rude employees), consumers in the low
   social class, relative to those in the high social class, carry over to
   influence their evaluations of the other service dimensions (e.g., food
   quality) that are unrelated to the failure incident. We further show
   that low-class consumers favor a holistic style of thinking, whereas
   high-class consumers favor an analytic style of thinking and that these
   differences in thinking style account for the carryover effects on
   evaluations. The pattern of the effects exists when the service failure
   is perceived to be severe rather than minor.

   Supported by the results of our pilot study, we argue this is because
   everyday brands represent a material norm that can be difficult for
   low-income consumers to achieve. Furthermore, our findings suggest that
   consumers from poor backgrounds may cope with this threat by becoming
   more self-interested, as indicated by decreased volunteer intentions.

AB Little empirical research has been reported on the role of spatial

   cognition literature, we propose that elevation from street level
   influences risk preferences. In a pilot study and four field studies
   involving financial decisions with both hypothetical and real payoffs,
   we find evidence that high physical elevation increases risk-seeking
   tendencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that elevation leads to riskier
   behavior by increasing sensitivity to power. Finally, we establish a
   boundary condition for the impact of elevation on risk preferences by
   demonstrating that the effect attenuates when accessibility of physical
   elevation is low. These findings show that a subtle environmental
   parameter- physical elevation from street level-can influence human
   psychological states and consequently affect decisions.

   part of this article introduces and discusses the construct of loss
   aversion. The second part of this article reviews evidence in support of
   loss aversion. The upshot of this review is that current evidence does
   not support that losses, on balance, tend to be any more impactful than
   gains. The third part of this article aims to address the question of
   why acceptance of loss aversion as a general principle remains pervasive
   and persistent among social scientists, including consumer
   psychologists, despite evidence to the contrary. This analysis aims to
   connect the persistence of a belief in loss aversion to more general
   ideas about belief acceptance and persistence in science. The final part
   of the article discusses how a more contextualized perspective of the
   relative impact of losses versus gains can open new areas of inquiry
   that are squarely in the domain of consumer psychology.

AB Although we disagree with some of Gal and Rucker's (2018 - this issue)
   specific evidence and with their overstated conclusion regarding loss
   aversion, their overarching message makes a worthwhile contribution. In
   particular, loss aversion is less robust and universal than has been
   assumed while its most prominent empirical support - the endowment
   effect and the status quo bias - is susceptible to multiple alternative
   explanations. Instead of accepting loss aversion as true unless proven
   otherwise, we should treat it like other decision properties and
   psychological accounts that are contingent on various moderators and
   call for an analysis of psychological mechanisms. In this commentary, we
   suggest that gatekeepers, such as reviewers, tend to favor loss aversion
   and other widely accepted tendencies, while demanding a much higher
   support-threshold for alternative or newer accounts. Although building
   on prior theories and concepts is of course important, the bias in favor
   of incumbent assumptions can impede scientific progress, bar new ideas
   from the literature, and reinforce well-established but contingent
   notions that may apply under some conditions but not others.

AB We agree with Gal and Rucker (2018, in press) that loss aversion is not
   as firmly established as typically assumed. We affirm, however, the more
   general principle put forward within Prospect Theory (D. Kahneman & A.
   Tversky, 1979), which is that reference points increase people's
   sensitivity to objective changes in value. We show how the literatures
   on counterfactual thought, social comparison, and goal pursuit are
   consistent with the notion that reference points increase sensitivity to
   change in value, while not being consistent with loss aversion. We then
   examine, within the framework of Regulatory Focus theory (E. T. Higgins,
   1997, 1998), how different reference points combine with characteristics
   of the actor and the situation to give rise to loss aversion (more
   sensitivity to negative outcomes than to positive outcomes) as well as
   to the reverse pattern (more sensitivity to positive outcomes than to
   negative outcomes). Our review suggests that the status quo, even when
   used as a reference point, is not necessarily neutral. It also suggests
   that anchor points other than the status quo may serve as reference
   points and that people may use more than one reference point
   simultaneously. More generally, we call for a critical examination of
   the "bad is stronger than good" principle.

AB Higgins and Liberman (2018) and Simonson and Kivetz (2018) offer

   implications for the sociology of science of its acceptance as a virtual
   law of nature. In our view, Higgins and Liberman (2018) largely
   complement our conclusion that the empirical evidence does not support
   loss aversion. Moreover, in alignment with our call for a contextualized
   perspective, they provide an excellent discourse on how a more nuanced
   view of reference points and consumers' regulatory focus enriches our
   understanding of the psychological impact of losses and gains. Simonson
   and Kivetz (2018) approached our perspective with skepticism, and, while
   they retain some skepticism, they express agreement on the larger point
   that loss aversion has been accepted too uncritically. Both commentaries

   Here, we build on these perspectives, as well as our experience working

AB Despite a recognition that consumers want to be cool and value cool
   brands, the literature has only just begun to delineate what makes

   by being emotionally inexpressive. The relationship between emotional
   expression and coolness, however, has not been empirically tested. Our
   research uses an experimental approach to examine whether being
   emotionally inexpressive makes people seem more or less cool than
   smiling. In contrast to the belief that being inexpressive is cool, we
   find that in noncompetitive contexts-an endorser in a clothing
   advertisement and an athlete interacting with fans-being inexpressive
   makes people seem cold rather than cool. On the other hand, in
   competitive contexts-such as an athlete facing his opponent-being
   inexpressive makes people seem cool by making them appear dominant. Our
   results have important implications for marketers, advertisers, and

AB In intertemporal choices between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later
   (LL) rewards, five studies reveal that patience for the LL option is
   influenced by an interactive effect of the measurement units used to
   express wait time (large vs. small) and the type of the reward (hedonic
   vs. utilitarian). Specifically, larger time units boost patience, but
   more so when rewards are hedonic rather than utilitarian. In line with
   the numerosity heuristic, the effect of time units on patience is
   mediated by larger time units shrinking wait time perception. This
   effect arises because hedonic (vs. utilitarian) rewards promote a
   reliance on heuristics rather than systematic calculations. Therefore, a
   more calculative mindset diminishes the effect of units even for hedonic
   rewards and eliminates the hedonic-utilitarian asymmetry. These results
   contribute to research on numerosity, intertemporal choice, and
   hedonic-utilitarian differences, and offer a simple tool for
   practitioners to influence patience.

AB Sunk cost bias is a pervasive problem in consumer decision making. It
   occurs when people continue to invest resources toward unsuccessful
   outcomes merely because they previously invested in them. This tendency
   exists because people devote too much attention to prior investments
   without considering how other factors may impact their decision outcome.
   While many suggested interventions to attenuate sunk cost bias involve
   altering cognitive processes, we examine an alternate affective route.
   Specifically, we propose that inducing positive affect attenuates sunk
   cost bias by naturally facilitating flexible thought processes. Across
   four studies, using hypothetical and real decision tasks, we find that
   positive affect induced in three different ways consistently attenuates
   sunk cost bias involving money, time, and effort investments. Further,
   we demonstrate that this occurs because people experiencing positive
   affect have enhanced cognitive flexibility. They consider more relevant
   decision factors and perceive sunk cost as having less of an influence
   on their decision outcomes. Then, in a fifth study, we show that a
   thought intervention promoting flexibility can attenuate consumers'
   suboptimal commitment tendency in a field setting.

AB Prior research has found that people perceive positive objects and
   locations as physically closer than negative ones. Yet, other work has
   found the opposite to be true for perceptions of temporal distance,
   where negative future events feel closer than positive ones. Motivated
   by this seeming discrepancy, we propose that (a) feelings of control can
   differentially influence how far away valenced (i.e., positive or
   negative) targets feel in space and time and that (b) the difference in
   perceived control over space versus time can account for these opposite
   findings. First, across four studies, we show that high (vs. low)
   control makes positive targets feel closer and negative targets feel
   more distant in both physical space (Studies 1 and 1a) and time (Studies
   2 and 2a). Then, in Studies 3 and 4, we simultaneously examine
   perceptions of spatial and temporal distance and show that baseline
   differences in perceived control between these domains can explain the
   prior discrepant findings. Finally, a within-paper meta-analysis offers
   further support to these findings.

AB In the face of the growing prevalence of multiple appeals to sustainable
   consumption in marketers' sustainable product communications, we examine
   the efficacy, in terms of consumer reactions, of adding an extrinsic
   appeal (e.g., Purchase this green product to save money!) to an
   intrinsic appeal (e.g., Purchase this green product to save the
   environment!) based communication for a sustainable product. Three
   studies provide support for our basic assertion that, compared to an
   intrinsic appeal, joint appeals (i.e., an intrinsic and extrinsic appeal
   together) reduce consumer preference for sustainable products. As well,
   these studies demonstrate that this adverse effect of joint appeals is
   based on a lowering of consumers' attributions of the company's
   sustainability efforts to intrinsic motives (e.g., to the company's
   genuine concern for the environment). Finally, not all consumers react
   adversely to joint appeals; relative to intrinsic appeals, such appeals
   increase, rather than decrease, the intrinsic attributions and
   sustainable product preferences for consumers with lower involvement
   with sustainable consumption.

AB Communicators have at their disposal an ever-increasing variety of
   modalities by which to transmit messages. Do the prominent norms
   attached to different communication modalities contain information in
   and of themselves? The present investigation considers this question
   through the lens of text messages and emails, hypothesized to confer
   different normative information about urgency. Text messages (vs.
   emails)-or any communication inferred by receivers to have been sent
   with greater urgency-cause the content of those messages to seem, in the
   eyes of receivers, closer in time (Study 1), closer in space (Study 2),
   and more likely to occur (Study 3). Moderation and mediation analyses
   confirm the role of urgency underlying the relationship between modality
   and distance. We provide evidence for these effects in a series of
   laboratory studies together with a field study in which real text
   messages and emails impact not only inferred distance but also a
   behavior deriving therefrom. Theoretical and practical implications
   highlight the importance, for both researchers and practitioners, of
   understanding how the medium of communication can shape interpretation
   of the message.

AB Although much of consumption behavior is prompted by the pursuit of
   happiness, enduring happiness remains elusive, since happiness is
   destined to adaptation. Our research identifies a novel yet simple
   method of slowing hedonic adaptation from consumption activities:
   reducing specificity of the happiness goal. We propose that in the realm
   of happiness, contrary to findings from other domains, having a general
   (e.g., feeling good) versus a specific (e.g., excitement) emotional goal
   might hold the key to more enduring happiness. One lab experiment and a
   longitudinal study demonstrate general (vs. specific) goals expand the
   breadth of emotions experienced from consumption activities, which in
   turn impact the top-of-mind awareness of the consumption target over
   time; higher top-of-mind awareness of the target allows one to continue
   to derive happiness from it. Importantly, the happiness advantage of
   general emotional goals strengthens over time. Given a significant
   tendency by consumers to pursue specific happiness goals (as three pilot
   studies reveal), a simple change in the way they formulate their
   happiness goals could be consequential for consumer wellbeing.

AB Symbols can exert an influence on how we think, feel, and even behave.
   Here we examine whether symbolic markings serve as primes and influence
   how people make judgments. We propose that making either a check or an X
   mark to indicate an opinion can lead people to process the same
   information differently, thereby influencing the judgment people make.
   Across four experiments, we find that the check and X marks carry
   different symbolic associations; people associate check with good and X
   with bad. We also find downstream consequences of these mental
   associations. People who make positively connoted check marks (as
   opposed to negatively connoted X marks) to indicate their judgments are
   more agreeable toward familiar, controversial social policies as well as
   market research survey items on values and life styles. Differential
   symbolic markings with check and X marks seem to shape how people think
   and make judgments.

AB Generic price terms such as cheap, not expensive, not cheap, and
   expensive are used frequently in marketing, but little is known about
   how consumers interpret them. In typical consumer contexts, in which
   lower prices are preferred, we find that not cheap means essentially the
   same as expensive (i.e., not cheap = expensive). In contrast, not
   expensive does not mean the same as cheap, in that cheap is associated
   with lower prices (i.e., cheap < not expensive). As an implication, in a
   consumer survey we find different response distributions for rating
   scales that are anchored with endpoint labels of not expensive versus
   expensive as compared to cheap versus expensive or cheap versus not
   cheap (the latter two are equivalent). Furthermore, although cheap is
   associated with lower prices than not expensive, this does not
   necessarily translate into higher preferences for options that are
   described as cheap (vs. not expensive), because cheap may also evoke
   negative quality perceptions. Finally, we demonstrate an interesting
   reversal in the way price terms are interpreted: when higher prices are
   preferred, cheap is equal to not expensive (i.e., cheap = not
   expensive), whereas not cheap is associated with lower prices than
   expensive (i.e., not cheap < expensive).

AB Providing calorie counts on restaurants' menus/menu boards is one of the
   most prominent policy interventions that has been implemented to combat
   the obesity epidemic in America. However, previous research across
   multiple disciplines has found little effect of providing calorie counts
   on calories ordered, leading some to call calorie provision a failed
   policy. The authors propose that this failure is partly due to not
   considering how people process information when making food choices:
   Americans read from left-to-right, processing calorie information only
   after processing the food item's name. Thus, the authors test a simple
   way to improve the effectiveness of calorie counts: display calorie
   counts to the left (vs. right) of food items. A field study and a
   laboratory study with American participants found that calorie counts to
   the left (vs. right) decreased calories ordered by 16.31%. A final
   laboratory study demonstrated that this effect is reversed among
   Hebrew-speakers, who read from right-to-left, providing further evidence
   that the order in which calorie information is processed matters.
   Accordingly, calling calorie labeling a policy failure may be premature.

AB While past work has explored some of the reasons why people themselves
   may remain silent in a group, almost no research has examined the mirror
   image of this question: How do consumers construe the silence of others?
   Do they project the opinions of the speakers in a conversation onto the
   silent individuals, assuming that silence signals agreement? Do they
   have a usual or "default" naive theory of silence that they use to
   explain it across multiple contexts-i.e., "silence usually signals
   disagreement?" Or does silence act as a mirror, reflecting observers'
   own opinions back at them? Three experiments contrasted perceivers'
   estimates of conversational silence with their estimates of unknown
   opinions outside the conversation. Estimates of opinions outside the
   conversation generally followed an agreement-with-the-speakers rule-the
   more an opinion was expressed in the group, the more consumers assumed
   others would support it too. In contrast, silence inside the
   conversation was interpreted very differently, serving as a mirror for
   participants' own thoughts, even when the vocal majority favored the
   opposite position. Results suggest a process whereby observers project
   the reason they personally would have been silent in the group (given
   their opinion) onto silence, leading to an inference that the silents
   agree with the self.

   transactions to the next highest dollar and donate the difference to
   charity. However, little is known about how consumers respond to such an
   appeal. Across a series of lab experiments and one large field study, we
   find that consumers respond more favorably to a roundup than to a flat
   donation request, even when the requested amount is identical. We find
   evidence that the effect arises because a roundup request reduces
   consumers' perceived pain of donating. Three alternative explanations
   are examined (i.e., objective financial cost, inattention to donation
   cost, and perceived novelty of the request) but not supported. This
   research has important implications for both companies and nonprofits

   variety seeking as a means of reducing physical satiation (McAlister,
   1982), more recent research suggests that the relationship between
   choosing variety and minimizing satiation is more complex, as these
   behaviors may be motivated and influenced by exogenous factors. Past
   reviews have largely looked at the two processes separately. In this
   article, we discuss the nuanced relationship between these two

AB Consumers with stigmatized identities may be especially attentive to
   organizational cues that signal to them whether or not they are welcomed
   and valued consumers. These stigmatized-identity cues can become a part
   of a company's brand, influencing the attractiveness of the company and
   consumer loyalty, and allowing consumers to draw inferences about an
   organization's ideologies and attitudes toward multiple stigmatized
   groups. Consumers with stigmatized identities attend to
   stigmatized-identity cues that signal inclusion (or exclusion) toward
   other stigmatized groups, resulting in stigmatized-identity cue
   transfers, especially when similarity mindsets are activated, and among
   consumers who are high in stigma solidarity. Because identity is central
   in consumer behavior, stigmatized-identity threat cues can at times
   result in anti-consumption, including boycotts, allowing consumers and
   companies to engage in collective action. This article reviews this
   growing body of research, demonstrating the important influence of
   stigmatized-identity cues on consumer behavior and discussing ways in
   which companies can better signal their inclusive attitudes and

   campaigns not only include an assortment of prizes but also an
   assortment of offerings that one can buy to enter the lottery-such as a
   small or an extra-large coffee. While companies regularly advertise that
   the objective odds of winning do not vary by the size of their product
   offerings, recent anecdotal evidence suggest that consumers behave as if
   it does. The net result is that consumers seem to be supersizing during
   promotional lotteries, and thus purchasing larger sized items. Eight
   studies (four core and four supplementary in Supporting information) and
   a single-paper meta-analysis confirm that the supersizing phenomenon is
   indeed real and provides evidence that this behavior is the
   manifestation of consumers elevating their sense of control.
   Specifically, supersizing serves to gain psychological control over the

AB Academics have shown a growing interest in the effects of resource
   scarcity-a discrepancy between one's current resource levels and a
   higher, more desirable reference point. However, the existing literature
   lacks an overarching theory to explain the breadth of findings across
   different types of resources. To address this, we introduce a
   self-regulatory model of resource scarcity. In it, we propose that
   consumers respond to resource scarcity through two distinct
   psychological pathways: a scarcity-reduction route aimed at reducing the
   discrepancy in resources and a control-restoration route aimed at
   reestablishing diminished personal control by attaining security in
   other domains. We explain how a key determinant of which route the
   consumer will pursue is the perceived mutability of the resource
   discrepancy. We also specify moderators, based on our proposed model, to
   identify when each of the two routes is pursued. This model is assessed
   in the context of alternative theoretical perspectives, including
   commodity theory, life history theory, and models of compensatory
   behavior. Finally, we provide a research agenda for those interested in
   studying the psychology of resource scarcity from a self-regulatory
   perspective.

   self-control efforts by increasing their desire for indulgent foods
   under certain conditions. Specifically, this research reveals that when
   an indulgent food is advertised with a cue that sets the occasion for
   consumption (i.e., an occasion-setting cue), holistic (vs. analytic)
   thinking increases craving and subsequent purchase likelihood for the
   featured product. Evidence for this effect is found across three studies
   using both self-reported and physiological measures of craving.
   Furthermore, the effect holds regardless of whether holistic thinking is
   measured or manipulated. Finally, this research provides evidence for
   the underlying mechanism and establishes important boundary conditions
   for the interactive effect.

AB As Chaney, Sanchez, and Maimon (2019-this issue) detail, the prevalence
   of anti-stigmatization cues may encourage us to believe that a more
   inclusive marketplace is on the horizon. This commentary argues that,
   unfortunately, three barriers have limited the effectiveness of these
   cues, and that each constitutes a call to serious inquiry for a wide
   range of consumer researchers. First, marketers have done little to
   reach out to the most severely stigmatized groups, limiting the degree
   to which inclusive marketing can effect real societal change. Second,
   researchers have not systematically articulated reasons that
   anti-stigmatization cues may fall flat or even backfire, leaving
   practitioners little guidance in designing effective cues. Finally,
   studying stigmatization presents methodological challenges, and may feel
   like a minefield to researchers not well-versed in complex issues of
   sexuality, race and ethnicity. If we are willing to address such
   barriers, however, I argue that we can build a framework for a "dignity
   architecture." Like choice architecture, this framework highlights the
   nonneutrality of marketing actions in experience design, ultimately
   offering guidance for affirming consumer worth.

AB Domestic violence has serious consequences for survivors, including
   severe effects on psychological well-being and identity. This article
   reveals the previously hidden possession experiences and identity work
   of domestic violence survivors. Using a novel visual research method
   that features material objects as visual stimuli to elicit data, we
   found possessions were critical in the complex identity work undertaken
   by survivors. Emergent themes detailing the role of possessions in
   coping with ongoing self-threats by an intimate partner provide
   empirical support for the conceptualization of diametrically opposed
   selves, the Prescribed Self and Agentic Self. These opposite and
   compartmentalized selves enabled survivors to cope with extreme
   disintegration and destabilization of self by the abuser. As well as the
   conceptual and methodological contributions we make to the
   possessions-self literature in consumer research and psychology, this
   research is valuable for designing social service programs to help
   survivors cope with the effects of domestic violence on identity.

AB This research explores how mood interacts with outcome and implemental
   mind-sets to influence motivation to work toward a goal. We propose and
   demonstrate that being in a positive (vs. neutral) mood increases
   motivation for those in an outcome mind-set. Conversely, being in a
   positive (vs. neutral) mood decreases motivation for those in an
   implemental mind-set. We argue that the reason for this is rooted in the
   role of positive mood on the number of available goal attainment means:
   Positive (vs. neutral) mood was found to increase the number of
   accessible goal attainment activities. For those in an outcome mind-set,
   the increased number of goal attainment activities increases motivation
   because more activities are perceived as more available opportunities or
   strategies that may aid in successful goal attainment. For those in an
   implemental mind-set, where one considers detailed steps and processes
   required for goal completion, motivation is decreased, because
   availability of more activities increases perceived difficulty of goal
   execution. Five studies support these hypotheses, showing differences in
   available activities depending on mood, differences in perceptions of
   those activities depending on mind-set, and differences in motivation
   depending on the interaction of mood and mind-set.

AB We argue that, contrary to standard views of development, children
   understand the world in terms of hidden, nonobvious structure. We review
   research showing that early in childhood, items are not understood
   strictly in terms of the features that present themselves in the
   immediate "here-and-now," but rather are thought to have a hidden
   reality. We illustrate with two related but distinct examples: category
   essentialism, and attention to object history. We discuss the
   implications of each of these capacities for how children determine
   object value. Across a broad range of object types (natural and
   artifactual, real and virtual, durable and consumable), an item is
   evaluated very differently, depending on inferred qualities and context.
   In this way, children's early-emerging conceptual frameworks influence
   how objects attain both psychological and monetary value, and may have
   important implications for which messages children find most persuasive.

   further this conversation by examining how children value products and

   instrumental valuation. Specifically, we examine developmental trends in
   instrumental valuation for three goals-self-concept development,
   self-presentation, and happiness. Across these areas, we find that
   children place greater value on products and brands for meeting these
   goals as they grow older, particularly during late childhood and early

   counterfeit product has been judged to be an authentic luxury product
   (high authenticity signal) or a counterfeit product (low authenticity
   signal). Low authenticity signals trigger higher levels of social
   anxiety than do high authenticity signals. And, higher levels of social
   anxiety result in decreases in moral disengagement regarding counterfeit
   purchases. The end result is that low authenticity signals lead to lower
   purchase intentions and actual spending on counterfeit luxury goods
   compared to high authenticity signals. In a final study, the authors use
   these findings to develop a new anticounterfeit advertising strategy,
   and show it to be effective in reducing females' interest in purchasing

AB Consumers making repeat consumption choices often need to decide whether
   to stick to their favorite option or to select something different.
   Understanding the situational factors that influence their willingness
   to seek more or less variety in consumption is of both theoretical and
   practical importance. The current research proposes that a salient
   relationship stateromantic crushcan increase consumers' variety-seeking
   tendency in unrelated consumption situations. Building on the
   compensatory consumption literature, we suggest that the lack of
   reciprocal response in the romantic crush experience may lower
   consumers' sense of control in the romantic relationship. Therefore,
   they are motivated to restore their sense of control by making more
   varied choices in consumption domains. Five studies provide support for
   this hypothesis. In line with our control-restoration account, the
   effect disappears when consumers' sense of control is boosted via other
   means. Moreover, the effect is specific to the experience of a romantic
   crush and cannot be generalized to other types of romantic relationship
   (e.g., initial stage of love).

AB Although both top-dog and underdog positioning appeals are widely used
   in marketing and advertising, little is known about which strategy is
   more effective in persuading consumers. By introducing a sense of power,
   a social variable that is inherently relevant to the nature of the
   top-dog versus underdog classification, we propose that consumers'
   responses to these two appeals are influenced by their psychological
   experience of power. Specifically, low-power consumers will respond to
   top-dog appeals more favorably because associating with top dogs
   facilitates power restoration. In contrast, high-power consumers will
   respond to underdog appeals more favorably because supporting underdogs
   facilitates power expression. In four experimental studies, we provide
   consistent support for our main predictions as well as the underlying
   processes. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate the differential effect of
   consumers' power states on their attitudes toward top-dog versus
   underdog appeals. Providing process evidence, Studies 3 and 4 identify
   boundary conditions under which the basic effect was eliminated. These
   findings contribute to the persuasion literature and power research and
   provide important implications for positioning strategy and

   posts from Humans of New York, a popular photography blog on social

   findings further demonstrate the causal impact of readability and the

AB Financial constraints are economic limitations on behavior. Given that
   millions of people experience chronic or episodic financial constraints,
   we sought to review research that provides insight into how they affect
   consumer behavior. We propose an integrative framework that draws
   insights from multiple literatures that have examined financial
   constraints from different perspectives. The framework distinguishes
   between four perspectives, which are rooted in literatures on resource
   scarcity, choice restriction, social comparison, and environmental
   uncertainty and highlights different temporal stages of responding to
   financial constraints, distinguishing between reacting, coping, and
   adapting. Beyond the obvious negative effects of financial constraints,
   our framework emphasizes consumer resilience, highlighting that
   consumers often successfully cope with and devise adaptive strategies to
   deal with financial constraints. By broadening the behavioral and
   temporal scope of financial constraints considered within consumer
   psychology, this framework helps us to understand the often strong and
   sometimes counterintuitive effects of financial constraints on consumer
   behavior.

AB When couples decide to share their lives, they must also decide how to
   pool their finances. In this article, we ask: Does the type of bank
   account from which one spends (joint vs. separate) affect the type of
   products one chooses to buy (utilitarian vs. hedonic)? Real-world
   evidence from analyzing bank transaction records (study 5), as well as
   data collected from experiments in the field (studies 1 and 2) and lab
   (studies 3 and 4), converge to support the hypothesis that couple
   members who spend from a joint bank account are more likely to choose
   utilitarian (vs. hedonic) products, than those who spend from a separate
   bank account. We find that these different spending patterns are driven
   by an increased need to justify spending to one's partner that is
   experienced when money is pooled together. If a hedonic product becomes
   easier to justify (study 4), the effect of account type on spending
   patterns disappears. These findings have important theoretical and
   practical implications for better understanding financial
   decision-making within romantic couples.

AB When it comes to trading time for money (or vice versa), people tend to
   be impatient and myopic. Often dramatically so. For illustration, half
   of people would rather collect $15 now than $30 in 3 months. This
   willingness to forego 50% of the reward to skip a 3-month wait
   corresponds to an annual discount rate of 277%. This article
   investigates how money's physical form biases intertemporal choice. We
   ask, what happens to (im)patience (i.e., discount rates) when time is
   traded against cash rather than against an equivalent sum of
   dematerialized money? We find that intertemporal decisions pitting time
   against cash (rather than against dematerialized money) increase
   impatience. The underlying mechanism relates to the pain of parting from
   money. Letting go of cash (dematerialized money) we can have now is
   psychologically more (less) painful, which in turn reduces (increases)
   our willingness to wait for larger-later payoffs. Importantly,
   heightening prevention focus (i.e., concerns for safety and security)
   moderates this bias. The article concludes by discussing the
   implications of the research, particularly for the psychology of saving

AB How do consumers assess their mastery of knowledge they have learned? We
   explore this question by investigating a common knowledge consumption
   situation: encountering opportunities for further learning. We argue and
   show that such opportunities can trigger a feeling-of-not-knowing-it-all
   (FONKIA), which lowers consumers' confidence in their mastery of the
   knowledge they already possess. Specifically, listing optional follow-up
   readings at the conclusion of a course lowered students' confidence in
   their mastery of the course material they had already learned (Study 1).
   Encountering an optional learning opportunity increased the FONKIA,
   which mediated the decreased confidence (Studies 2 and 3). We also
   document two moderators consistent with our conceptualization. First,
   participants primed with mastery (vs. instrumental) motivation were more
   negatively impacted when they encountered optional learning
   opportunities. Second, the more related the optional opportunities were
   to the target topic, the lower participants' confidence in their mastery
   of what they had already learned. We conclude by discussing the
   implications of these findings, such as encouraging further learning or

   in which embarrassment can affect consumer behavior in both public and
   private contexts. We define embarrassment using this broader
   conceptualization and outline the transgressions that might trigger
   embarrassment in consumption contexts. We also discuss the diverse
   implications of embarrassment for consumer behavior, and review the
   strategies that both consumers and practitioners can use to mitigate
   embarrassment and its negative consequences. We hope this framework will
   stimulate new research on consumer embarrassment in both public and
   private contexts.

AB According to construal level theory, consumers' processing styles become
   more abstract as psychological distance increases, but they grow more
   concrete when psychological distance decreases. This study provides
   evidence that panoramic pictures in which the horizon appears in the
   lower versus upper part of the frame trigger a different level of
   construal. As such, this study raises a novel source of construal. In
   addition, this study shows that when both visual (e.g., horizon height)
   and verbal (e.g., temporal benefit) advertising elements induce the same
   level of construal, advertising effectiveness increases. This work
   differs from previous research in that it focuses on the construal fit
   evoked by two advertisement features rather than a fit in construal
   between an external stimulus and the internal mindset of the consumer.

   articulated through cultural myths, metaphors, ideologies, and cultural
   objects circulate through the brand assemblage and through the consumer

AB Images play a central role in digital marketing. They attract attention,
   trigger emotions, and shape consumers' first impressions of products and
   brands. We propose that the shift from one-to-many mass communication to
   highly personalized one-to-one communication requires an understanding
   of image appeal at a personal level. Instead of asking "How appealing is
   this image?" we ask "How appealing is this image to this particular
   consumer?" Using the well-established five-factor model of personality,
   we apply machine learning algorithms to predict an image's personality
   appeal-the personality of consumers to which the image appeals most-from
   a set of 89 automatically extracted image features (Study 1). We
   subsequently apply the same algorithm on new images to predict
   consequential outcomes from the fit between consumer and image
   personality. We show that image-person fit adds incremental predictive
   power over the images' general appeal when predicting (a) consumers'
   liking of new images (Study 2) and (b) consumers' attitudes and purchase
   intentions (Study 3).

AB Anchoring effects influence a wide range of numeric judgments, including
   valuation judgments, such as willingness-to-pay (WTP). However, prior
   research has not established whether anchoring only temporarily distorts
   responses or exerts persistent influence on preferences. This article
   presents three incentive compatible experiments examining the long-term
   effects of random anchoring on WTP. Study 1 evaluated the persistence of
   anchoring effects over long durations, and showed that the strength of
   the effect decayed but did not disappear completely even 8 weeks later.
   In Study 2, a random anchor significantly influenced WTP after one week,
   regardless of whether WTP was also elicited immediately following the
   anchoring procedure, showing that consistency motivations do not account
   for persistence of anchoring effects. Study 3 showed relatively low
   anchors resulted in more stable valuations, compared with participants
   who reported WTP with no anchoring procedure. Together with the pattern
   of decay over time in Study 1, this suggests that anchoring facilitates
   the "imprinting" of valuation judgments for later retrieval. These
   studies show that anchoring effects can lead to lasting changes in
   valuation judgments, providing the first demonstration of long-term
   persistence of constructed preferences as a result of an uninformative
   and arbitrary manipulation.

   packages in the marketplace. In this research, we examine the influence
   of a hero versus a villain label on the preference for virtue versus
   vice products. Across seven laboratory and field studies, we find that
   consumers derive higher utility for a hero (villain) label with a vice
   (virtue) food than from a hero (villain) label with a virtue (vice)
   food. Relying on a coherence-based explanation, we propose that a hero
   label adds a beneficial aspect to vice foods, making them appear less
   harmful, whereas a villain label adds an edgy aspect to virtue foods,
   making them appear more fun. This research provides insights into the
   effect of hero and villain branding and offers implications for

   this research are to provide evidence for the prevalence of keeping
   brand consumption a secret and to understand the resulting cognitive

   occurrence of secrecy in the context of brand consumption, its types,
   and its motivations, underscoring the need for further investigation.
   Then, through a series of three subsequent studies, we demonstrate that
   keeping brand consumption a secret can lead to enhanced self-brand
   connections through the underlying processes of thought suppression and
   thought intrusion. We rule out alternative explanations and enhance
   generalizability through the examination of passive (e.g., avoiding)

AB People vary dramatically in their calorie estimates of food depending on
   the information available to them. Prior research has focused on
   information that is normatively relevant to the number of calories a
   food contains (e.g., fat content, serving size). The current research
   examines whether information that is normatively irrelevant to the
   number of calories a food contains-such as its availability-might also
   shape people's calorie estimates. Three studies found that a food
   perceived as limited in availability leads people to estimate the food
   to contain more calories. Serial mediation analyses revealed that this
   effect occurs because scarce food is seen as more valuable and
   expensive, which subsequently induces feelings of resource deprivation.
   This sense of resource deprivation, in turn, leads to motivated
   perception, whereby higher calorie estimates are the result of people
   wanting to acquire more resources. The findings provide insight into the
   psychology of scarcity and underscore the importance of understanding
   how contextual factors shape people's calorie estimates and the
   psychological mechanisms that drive them.

AB Double-discount is an effective format for promoting purchase decisions.
   However, extant literature has overlooked how temporal order of
   discounts applied affects consumers' purchase decisions. In this paper,
   we show that the sequence of discount magnitude (e.g., 10% followed by
   40% vs. 40% followed by 10%) leads to biases in consumer judgment and
   influences the perceived appeal and purchase intention of the deal. We
   term this the double-discount sequence effect. Using four experiments,
   we showed that double-discount in an ascending sequence (e.g., taking
   10% off, then an additional 40% off) is preferable over that in a
   descending sequence. We also found that discount application
   sequence-but not the presentation order-matters to consumers. Consumers
   anchor on the first discount they encounter and evaluate the second
   discount with respect to this first one.

AB This article endeavors to advance research on the cultural resonance of

   brand associations, product category associations, social identity, and
   self-identity. This integrative exercise highlights the value of
   cultural models in explaining the processes whereby brands acquire
   meaning, and suggests several themes that are under-valued when
   considering this process problem through a psychological lens: the
   motivational underpinnings of myths and other cultural meaning models,
   the relative value of shared cultural and brand meanings versus
   idiosyncratic meanings, the power and primacy of category-level meaning
   making over brand-level meaning making, the complex processes whereby

AB We present the first empirical integration of anthropomorphism and
   dehumanization, two intrinsically linked processes representing the
   extent to which the concept of humanness is activated for a given
   target. Across several experiments, we demonstrate that pairing a person
   and object in an ad, while focusing respondent attention on the object,
   leads to its being anthropomorphized and evaluated better compared to
   presenting it alone. However, compared to presenting a person alone, the
   same pairing leads to inferior evaluations of the person through a
   process of dehumanization. We rule out two alternative explanations for
   these effects, namely the transfer of an object's qualities to the
   person and consumption associations, and conduct a post-test that
   provides additional support for our proposed activation/inhibition of
   humanness account. Finally, we inspect several moderators, finding that
   anthropomorphism only occurs with moderately and highly functional
   objects and dehumanization occurs irrespective of the person's gender or
   fame. By incorporating the literature on dehumanization, we propose new
   research questions to motivate future inquiry.

AB Overconsumption of sugary drinks is linked with obesity. These beverages
   have been the target of recent public health policies, and,
   simultaneously, some firms have altered their pricing of such beverages,
   including charging the same price for all beverage sizes
   ("any-size-same-price" pricing). We compare the effect of
   any-size-same-price pricing versus standard pricing on soft drink
   beverage size choices and further explore the effect of this firm lever
   under different health-related policy situations. Overall, we show that
   any-size-same-price pricing increases consumers' focus on the value of
   getting a good financial deal and thereby increases beverage size
   selections. Further, the allure of any-size-same-price pricing prevents
   calorie postings from successfully reducing choice of larger sizes as
   occurs under standard pricing. However, a more graphic health
   intervention can reduce the appeal of larger sizes under
   any-size-same-price pricing. Finally, the findings are not moderated by
   diet versus nondiet beverage selections, indicating that consumers do
   not perceive the value of larger sizes under any-size-same-price pricing
   to come from getting more calories. We conclude by discussing how this
   work can improve the design of public health nutrition policies.

AB Products bearing premium brand labels are known to increase perceptions
   of efficacy and improve objective consumer performance relative to
   lesser-branded equivalents, in what is traditionally described as a
   marketing placebo effect. In this paper, we suggest that experiences
   bearing these highly regarded brand labels can lead to a reverse effect,
   such that consumer performance actually declines with their use. Our
   findings demonstrate across domains of improving mental acuity, learning
   a new language, and developing financial analysis skills that completing
   performance-branded training experiences impairs objective performance
   in related tasks, relative to lower-performance-branded or unbranded
   counterparts. We posit that branded training experiences can evoke a
   brand-as-master relationship in which consumers take on a subservient
   role relative to the brand. As a consequence, higher-performance brands
   may impose greater demands upon consumers, increasing
   performance-anxiety and interfering with an individual's ability to
   perform effectively. These results document an important ramification of
   applying branding to learning experiences and identify contexts in which
   traditionally positive marketing actions can backfire for consumers.

AB Prior research establishes that consumers are averse to extreme options,
   but what does a "moderate" option look like in the context of choices
   among bundles of items, such as investment portfolios or product
   assortment packs? We propose that for bundles, two paths to creating
   risk and reward balance exist: a "bundle-of-pure-moderation" with all
   moderate-risk-moderate-reward (moderate RR) components and a
   "bundle-of-extremes," composed of equal numbers of extreme
   high-risk-high-reward (high RR) and low-risk-low-reward (low RR)
   components. We show that consumers have stronger preference for the
   balanced bundle when composed of a bundle-of-extremes rather than a
   bundle-of-pure-moderation, even when equated on expected value, a
   phenomenon we term "the aggregated extremes effect." This effect occurs
   across different choice set configurations and across multiple domains.
   Additionally, this effect is eliminated among consumers who view the
   high RR and low RR components as incompatible, as this undermines the
   perceived attractiveness of the bundle-of-extremes. Finally, this effect
   is also eliminated by exposing consumers to a depiction of potential
   outcomes, such that consumers can better perceive the risk reduction
   upside of a bundle-of-pure-moderation.

AB While anecdotal evidence suggests that consumers maintain an association
   between high-status products and cold temperature, no research has
   empirically examined this linkage. We propose and demonstrate that
   physical cold can indeed increase consumers' perceptions of a product's
   status signaling and luxuriousness. We demonstrate this consequence can
   stem from tactile or visually induced temperatures and ultimately
   increase consumers' overall evaluations of products. Finally, we
   highlight boundary conditions for when the effect is likely to manifest.
   Our findings offer theoretical contributions along with several
   practical implications for retailing, product design, brand management,
   and marketing communications.

AB Four online grocery-shopping experiments and one field study using
   video-tracking technology at a grocery store document how shoppers'
   motivation evolves from the beginning to the end of their shopping
   trips. We uncover unique motivational patterns as shoppers achieve
   multiple subgoals (i.e., choose multiple grocery items) to complete
   their trips: a monotonic decrease in motivation for shoppers with a
   shopping list versus a curvilinear trend (i.e., decrease then increase)
   in motivation for shoppers without a list. In addition, we demonstrate
   how to reverse the observed patterns for shoppers with a list by
   changing their reference points for tracking progress. The discovery of
   the moderating role of shopping-list usage adds to the bubbling dialogue
   in goal pursuit and shopper psychology research concerning how consumer
   motivation follows either a monotonic trend (e.g., a goal gradient
   effect) or a nonmonotonic trend (e.g., the stuck-in-the-middle effect).
   Importantly, we demonstrate how the stuck-in-the-middle theory, which
   applies to single-goal pursuits, can apply more broadly to the domain of
   grocery shopping, which consists of the generation and completion of
   multiple subgoals.

   developmentally constructive (e.g., academic pursuits and
   extracurricular activities). In this article, we discuss two main
   topics: (a) the challenges and opportunities that characterize
   adolescence, based primarily on research in epidemiology and
   neuroscience, and (b) the ways that parents, community members, and
   policymakers can facilitate positive adolescent development, based on
   research from many disciplines including marketing, psychology,
   sociology, communications, public health, and education. Our goal is to
   summarize the latest scientific findings that can be used by various
   stakeholders to help adolescents navigate this turbulent period and
   become well-adjusted, thriving adults.

AB People often encounter information that they subsequently learn is
   false. Past research has shown that people sometimes continue to use
   this misinformation in their reasoning, even if they remember that the
   information is false, which researchers refer to as the continued
   influence effect. The current work shows that the continued influence
   effect depends on the stories people have in memory: corrected
   misinformation was found to have a stronger effect on people's beliefs
   than information that was topically related to the story if it helped to
   provide a causal explanation of a story they had read previously. We
   argue this effect occurs because information that can fill a causal
   "gap" in a story enhances comprehension of the story event, which allows
   people to build a complete (if inaccurate) event model that they prefer
   over an accurate but incomplete event model. This effect is less likely
   to occur for stories in memory that end in a negative way, presumably
   because people are more motivated to accurately understand negative
   outcome events.

AB We introduce symbolic sequence effects-the consequences of whether the
   sequence of the initial letters of a pair of words (e.g., a word
   representing a putative cause and another word representing a putative
   effect) conforms to the structure of symbolic sequences that are stored
   in the mind as overlearned natural language traces ("natural sequence").
   We synthesize insights from psychophysics as well as numerical and
   natural language symbolic representations to demonstrate that consumers
   are able to unconsciously perceive the mere sequence of symbols
   contained in a brand claim, and that this sequence information
   influences judgments of truth. Across three experiments, we showed that
   when a brand claim is structured in a way that is consistent with the
   natural sequence of symbols ("A causes B" rather than "B causes A"),
   people experience feelings of sequential fluency, which in turn
   influences judgments of truth. This occurs despite the inability of
   participants to attribute the true source of the feelings. Our results
   suggest that carefully designed brand claims are likely to benefit from
   this natural sequencing. These findings provide important contributions
   to the literatures on processing fluency, branding, and advertising.
   These findings also have sobering societal implications and warn that
   fake news might be more persuasive if the perpetrators understand
   symbolic sequencing techniques.

AB This research investigates how consumer evaluations of brand extensions
   are affected by two distinct types of brand reputation: a reputation for
   social responsibility built through commitments to societal obligations,
   versus a reputation for ability developed by delivering quality
   offerings. Through six studies, we establish that while the two
   reputation types equivalently influence high fit brand extensions, a
   reputation for social responsibility (vs. ability) leads to more
   favorable responses toward low fit brand extensions by inducing a desire
   to support and help the company that has acted to benefit consumers.
   Furthermore, the facilitative effect of social responsibility on low fit
   brand extension evaluations is more prominent among consumers who value
   close relationships and caring for one another's well-being (i.e., those
   with high communal orientation), and tends to dissipate when social
   responsibility initiatives are tainted with self-serving motives (i.e.,
   when these initiatives are aligned with the brand's core offering).

AB Seven studies test and support the prediction that consumers are more
   willing to accept a price increase for an experiential versus a material
   purchase; an effect explained by the greater uniqueness of experiences.
   Critically, the uniqueness model advanced here is found to be
   independent of the happiness consumers derive from the purchase. To gain
   a deeper understanding of the uniqueness mechanism, this investigation
   then advances and tests a four-facet framework of uniqueness (unique
   opportunity, unique purchase, unique identity, and counterconformity).
   Together, the findings converge on the conclusion that consumers
   perceive the opportunity to have a particular experience (vs. object) as
   more unique, and this unique opportunity increases their willingness to
   accept a price increase. Overall, this work extends the experiential
   versus material purchases literature into a new domain-that of pricing;
   identifies the dimension-uniqueness-and its precise facet responsible
   for the effect-unique opportunity; and demonstrates that this model
   unfolds in a pattern distinct from the oft researched model centered on
   consumer happiness. Theoretical and practical implications are

AB Online review helpfulness ratings are an important indicator of the
   impact of online reviews. Often times, helpfulness is explained in terms
   of observable qualities of online reviews that predict helpfulness
   ratings. This research proposes that focusing on the psychological
   processes that underlie helpfulness voting informs a better
   understanding of what shapes review helpfulness ratings. Specifically,
   because goal orientation influences information processing, consumers'
   regulatory orientation interacts with review valence to determine review
   helpfulness. When review valence and regulatory orientation match,
   consumers are more likely to express helpfulness through voting. The
   findings show that this effect occurs at least in part because matching
   review valence and regulatory orientation instills feelings of gratitude
   towards the reviewer. As a consequence, consumers are more likely to
   reward the reviewer with a helpfulness vote to express their feeling of
   gratitude through actions. However, when reviewers actively state
   expectations of reciprocal behavior by readers, gratitude is reduced and
   so is the likelihood that a review receives a helpfulness vote. Evidence
   from five studies using review data and online experiments show support
   for these effects.

AB Estimations that include numerical information are ubiquitous in our
   daily lives, for example, housing prices, calories, etc. In the present
   work, we investigate how the type of information used in an estimate,
   particularly its level of imprecision, influences evaluations of source
   trustworthiness after the target value of the estimate is revealed.
   Specifically, building upon prior work suggesting that (a) imprecise
   estimates are perceived to be less accurate than precise estimates and
   (b) performing below expectations results in negative source
   evaluations, we hypothesize that if the estimate is revealed to be
   incorrect, imprecise estimates (i.e., 400) elicit higher source
   trustworthiness than precise estimates (i.e., 417), even if the
   imprecise estimate is objectively more incorrect (i.e., target value:
   570). In addition, we find that this effect also influences consumers'
   loyalty toward the source of the estimate. Four studies and a
   single-paper meta-analysis offer triangulating evidence for this
   prediction and its underlying psychological mechanism. Overall, this
   work contributes to research on estimates, source evaluations, numerical
   information, and the influence of errors on consumer behavior.

AB We examine how the interplay of two partners' interpersonal orientations
   (selfish vs. altruistic) in a decision-making dyad impacts the extent to
   which the joint decision matches each partners' individual a priori
   preferences. Two experiments, in which we manipulate and measure
   interpersonal orientations, as well as examine real consumption
   decisions, demonstrate the benefit of mismatching interpersonal
   orientations (selfish-altruistic) in dyadic decisions. Specifically,
   altruistic and selfish consumers reach joint decisions that better
   reflect their individual preferences when working with a partner who has
   the opposite interpersonal orientation (heterogeneous dyad) versus a
   matching one (homogeneous dyad). Initial evidence suggests that this
   effect occurs because homogeneous dyads are more prone to engage in
   negotiation (communication that involves departure from one's initial
   position to a mutually serving position) than heterogeneous dyads. This
   leads homogeneous dyads to focus more on equally preferred options than
   on their own most preferred options, which pushes them further down both
   partners' preferences lists. This research contributes to the literature
   on joint decision making and has important implications for consumer

   the level of construal at which information is processed. In three

   Category experts perceive lower variety-seeking as indicative of
   discernment, which in turn increases perceived expertise in that

   themselves as experts. In contrast, novices perceive high
   variety-seeking as indicative of category breadth knowledge, which in

AB Prior consumer research has studied the impact of anthropomorphism on
   product perception and evaluation. This research explores how
   anthropomorphic thinking influences people's experience of emotions and
   subsequent consumption behavior. Based on research on emotion regulation
   and the psychological process of detachment, we show that individuals
   instructed to anthropomorphize sadness (i.e., think of sadness as a
   person) report less experienced sadness afterward (Studies 1 and 2A).
   The same result is observed for its opposite, happiness, such that
   anthropomorphic thinking dilutes happiness (Study 2B). We argue that
   this reduction of emotion occurs because anthropomorphic thinking
   increases the perceived distance between the self and the
   anthropomorphized emotion, thereby creating a feeling of detachment.
   Evidence for a detachment process is found via measurement (Studies 3
   and 4) and a theory-guided moderation, with the effect lessening when
   sadness is seen as a dependent (vs. independent) person (Study 3). These
   findings have implications for consumer behavior. When sadness is
   ameliorated by anthropomorphic thinking, people tend to display better
   self-control in subsequent consumption, as manifested by a greater
   likelihood of choosing a healthier or more practical product (Studies 4
   and 5).

AB Although the number of bilingual consumers is expanding, research on the
   impact of language on consumer decision making is scarce. The current
   research examines the endowment effect, which is a fundamental consumer
   decision-making regularity, under native versus foreign language
   processing. I show that the endowment effect, which refers to higher
   valuation of a given product by sellers than buyers, is attenuated when
   sellers and buyers process information in a foreign language due to a
   decrease in sellers' valuation of the product. I further document
   empirical evidence for the underlying mechanism of this finding.
   Thinking in a foreign language diminishes the impact of affective
   reactions on sellers' judgment, which results in lowered sense of
   psychological ownership. This lowered sense of psychological ownership
   significantly decreases sellers' valuation to a level comparable to the
   valuation of buyers. The implications of these results for theory and
   practice, and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB While gift-givers typically wrap gifts prior to presenting them, little
   is known about the effect of how the gift is wrapped on recipients'
   expectations and attitudes toward the gift inside. We propose that when
   recipients open a gift from a friend, they like it less when the giver
   has wrapped it neatly as opposed to sloppily and we draw on expectation
   disconfirmation theory to explain the effect. Specifically, recipients
   set higher (lower) expectations for neatly (sloppily)-wrapped gifts,
   making it harder (easier) for the gifts to meet these expectations,
   resulting in contrast effects that lead to less (more) positive
   attitudes toward the gifts once unwrapped. However, when the gift-giver
   is an acquaintance, there is ambiguity in the relationship status and
   wrapping neatness serves as a cue about the relationship rather than the
   gift itself. This leads to assimilation effects where the recipient
   likes the gift more when neatly wrapped. We assess these effects across
   three studies and find that they hold for desirable, neutral, and
   undesirable gifts, as well as with both hypothetical and real gifts.

AB Time is a scarce resource, and time-keeping has become a common part of
   our lives. This research investigates the impact of exposure to a
   specific direction of time-keeping on resource deficiency perception and
   on compensatory consumption of calories. Results from four studies show
   that exposure to downward time-keeping (e.g., 60 -> 1 s), compared to
   upward time-keeping (e.g., 1 -> 60 s), results in a higher perceived
   resource deficiency, leading to a higher preference, consumption, and
   choice of caloric foods. The effect is attenuated for evaluation of
   calorie-lean foods, or by recalling instances of resourcefulness, or

AB In the current research, we explore the possibility that politically
   conservative consumers may anthropomorphize consumer products more than
   their liberal counterparts. This is possibly because conservatives need
   to manage uncertainty in the marketplace. One way to do so might be by
   assigning more human-like attributes to inanimate products. We test this
   hypothesis in three studies by measuring (Studies 1 and 2) and
   manipulating political ideology (Study 3). We find that avoidance of
   uncertainty (Study 1) and need for order (Study 2) can explain
   conservatives' greater anthropomorphism. The effect is stronger for
   unpredictable than predictable products as the former are associated
   with greater uncertainty, which conservatives need to manage (Study 3).
   Also, we report that greater anthropomorphism of products can increase
   the perceived functionality of the products (Studies 2 and 3), offering
   implications for marketers. In all, the results offer support for our
   key hypothesis that conservatives anthropomorphize more; they also
   provide preliminary support for the role of uncertainty management in
   conservatives' greater anthropomorphism of products. In our General
   Discussion, we discuss alternate explanations for the key effect and
   present some directions for further research in this area.

AB This article introduces a Bayesian extension of ANOVA for the analysis
   of experimental data in consumer psychology. The approach, called BANOVA
   (Bayesian ANOVA), addresses some common challenges that consumer
   psychologists encounter in their experimental work, and is specifically
   suited for the analysis of repeated measures designs. There appears to
   be a recent surge in interest in those designs based on the recognition
   that they are sensitive to individual differences in response to
   experimental treatments and that they offer advantages for assessing
   causal mediating mechanisms, even at the individual level. BANOVA
   enables the analysis of repeated measures data derived from mixed
   within-between-subjects experiments with Normal and nonNormal-dependent
   variables and accommodates unobserved individual differences. It allows
   for the calculation of effect sizes, planned comparisons, simple
   effects, spotlight and floodlight analyses, and includes a wide range of
   mediation, moderation, and moderated mediation analyses. An R software
   package implements these analyses, and aims to provide a one-stop shop
   for the analysis of experiments in consumer psychology. The package is
   illustrated through applications to a number of data sets from
   previously published studies.

AB Past research shows that consumers evaluate bundles with complementary
   items more favorably than they evaluate bundles with noncomplementary
   items. In a series of four experiments that involve evaluation,
   willingness to pay, and real choice, we show that this well-established
   effect is moderated by the level of mindset abstraction. Complementarity
   (vs. noncomplementarity) among bundle items prompts relatively concrete
   (vs. abstract) thinking (study 1). Consequently, consumers evaluate
   complementary (vs. noncomplementary) bundles more favorably when they
   think in more concrete (vs. abstract) terms (study 2) or when the
   consumption context involves lower (vs. higher) spatial (study 3) or
   temporal (study 4) distance. These effects are mediated by consumers'
   heightened sense of "feeling right" during decision making under
   construal fit (study 4). Finally, the level of complementarity among
   bundle items differentially influences mental abstraction because of
   consumers' tendency to perceive bundles as a single inseparable unit.
   Therefore, the effect attenuates when consumers adopt a
   separating-rather than a connecting-mindset (study 3). Overall, this
   work significantly extends past research on product bundles and offers
   several managerial implications.

AB This article examines the effects of firm motivation (an intrinsic or

   authenticity and anticipated product quality. Specifically, studies 1
   and 2 show that an intrinsic motivation increases authenticity
   perceptions which, in turn, increase perceived product quality, even for
   negatively regarded products. Studies 3a and 3b demonstrate that
   motivation affects perceived product quality (through perceived
   authenticity) by influencing deliberate attribute-level inferences
   consumers make about the product, and Study 4 demonstrates that the
   positive effect of intrinsic motivation (through authenticity)
   disappears in the presence of objective product attribute information,
   when such inferences are no longer necessary. These findings suggest
   that authenticity perceptions are malleable, and they shed light on the
   mechanism through which brand authenticity leads consumers to anticipate
   that a brand's products will be higher in quality.

AB A core requirement of a functioning free-market system is that consumers
   hold companies accountable for selling faulty products. Following a
   harmful product failure, any blame that is incorrectly directed toward
   the victim may threaten consumer well-being. Four experiments-in
   contexts of both fictitious and actual high-profile product
   failures-show that this may in fact occur. The findings show that for a
   victim possessing immoral character: (a) consumers exaggerate blame
   because, (b) the victim is seen as deserving of suffering in general
   and, as a result, (c) consumers are less likely to take punitive action
   against the company (e.g., petition signing, negative word of mouth, and
   supporting financial justice). One field experiment and three online
   experiments converge to show that morality's effects are unique from
   other traits (e.g., sociability), but may be attenuated based on
   severity of harm to the victim and consumers' own beliefs about justice.
   In sum, the current research furthers understanding of how and why
   victims are blamed, how doing so may threaten consumer and societal
   well-being, and how it might be prevented.

AB New products are often extremely incongruent with expectations. The
   inability to make sense of these products elevates anxiety and leads to
   negative evaluations. Although scholars have predominantly focused on
   combating the negative response to extreme incongruity, we propose that
   extreme incongruity may have implications that extend beyond the
   category. We base our predictions on the concept of fluid compensation,
   which suggests that when people struggle to make sense of something,
   they will nonconsciously reinforce highly accessible schemas in
   unrelated domains. Four studies confirm that extreme incongruity
   encourages fluid compensation, such that it elevates preference for
   dominant brands (study 1), green consumption (studies 2 and 4), and
   ethnocentric products (study 3). We isolate the causal role of anxiety
   using moderation tasks and biometric feedback. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate that compensation has an immediate dampening effect on
   arousal intensity. Thus, if consumers can compensate before explicitly
   evaluating an extremely incongruent product, their evaluations tend not
   to be negative. Taken together, we document that extreme innovations
   encourage compensation, and in compensating, consumers can become more
   receptive to extreme innovations.

AB Self-control is a prominent topic in consumer research, where it is
   often conceptualized as the abstinence from hedonic consumption. We
   examine whether this conceptualization accurately captures consumers'
   experiences of self-control conflicts/failures in light of seminal
   self-control theories in economics and psychology. Rejecting that
   notion, we argue that self-control failures are choices in violation of
   superordinate long-term goals accompanied by anticipated regret, rather
   than choices of hedonic over utilitarian consumption. This
   conceptualization has important methodological, theoretical, and
   practical implications. Methodologically, it highlights the need for
   experimental paradigms with higher construct validity. Theoretically, it
   helps elucidate how self-control is distinct from impatience and
   self-regulation. Practically, it provides a rich set of implications for
   deducing interventions on the individual and public policy level to help
   consumers exert self-control.

AB Vosgerau, Scopelliti, and Huh (this issue) present an important critique
   of much self-control research, highlighting some of the ways that our
   customary operationalizations and methods may have created more
   confusion than clarity. Their insights, rooted in past literature and
   new data, offer recommendations that will undoubtedly help us improve
   our research in consumption self-control. In this commentary, I frame
   their work using the thought of Charles Sanders Peirce, a philosopher,
   mathematician, and logician whose frustration with the management of the
   self-control construct and subsequent revision parallels Vosgerau et
   al's in many ways. Further, his thought proposes that their thought
   traces the boundary of another type of self-control problem, which I'll
   refer to as "reflective self-control." Taking together consumption
   self-control and reflective self-control, we're able to address a wide
   range of human experiences and connect self-control to ethics,
   consistent with a long tradition bridging the two. Perhaps most
   importantly, though, a Peircean analysis suggests that Vosgerau et al's
   paper-whether we agree or disagree with its conclusions-exemplifies the
   kind of scholarly self-control we need to display to make scientific
   progress, regardless of our specific domain of study.

   family can have divergent impacts on consumers' subsequent purchase
   decisions. Across four experiments, as well as a pilot study, we
   demonstrate that accessibility of friend (vs. family) is more likely to
   activate a promotion focus, which results in more favorable consumer
   responses toward products with promotion-focused appeals, whereas
   accessibility of family (vs. friend) is more likely to activate a
   prevention focus, which leads to more positive consumer responses toward

AB This research provides a novel theoretical framework to explain the
   missing mechanism behind one of the strongest predictors for engaging in
   word of mouth (WOM): the consumer's psychological arousal (i.e., greater
   arousal leads to greater WOM; e.g., Berger, 2011). Across six studies (N
   = 1,309), we provide evidence for a motivational theory of the
   arousal-WOM relationship, highlighting the importance of the WOM's
   valence (positive vs. negative) as well as the consumer's salient type
   of arousal (energetic vs. tense; Thayer, 1989). In doing so, we
   demonstrate that consumers use WOM as an arousal management strategy:
   They are motivated to engage in positive WOM to maintain or increase
   their energetic arousal and to engage in negative WOM to reduce or
   eliminate their tense arousal. These findings also demonstrate the
   importance of the WOM recipient's response for the WOM source to achieve
   his/her desired arousal state. Thus, this work both expands our
   understanding of the arousal-WOM relationship and provides a framework
   for interpreting past work and conducting future investigations into
   when and how consumers will engage in WOM.

AB Loss aversion, the principle that losses impact decision making more
   than equivalent gains, is a fundamental idea in consumer behavior and
   decision making, though its existence has recently been called into
   question. Across five unique samples (N-total = 17,720), we tested
   several moderators of loss aversion, which supported a preference
   construction account. Across studies, more domain knowledge and
   experience were associated with lower loss aversion, though people of
   all knowledge and experience levels were loss averse. Among car buyers,
   those who knew more about a particular car attribute (e.g., fuel
   economy) were less loss averse for that attribute but not other
   attributes (e.g., comfort), consistent with the idea that people with
   less attribute knowledge are more likely to construct preferences,
   thereby increasing loss aversion. Additionally, older consumers were
   more loss averse across different loss aversion measures and studies. We
   discuss implications for several accounts of loss aversion, including
   accounts rooted in status quo bias, emotion, or ownership. In addition
   to discovering loss aversion moderators, we cast doubt on recent claims
   that loss aversion is a fallacy or is fully explained by status quo
   bias, risk aversion, or the educated laboratory samples often used to
   study loss aversion.

AB Decisions are mostly influenced by what is in sight. Because usage
   frequency (i.e., how frequently the consumer expects to use the product)
   is generally not in sight in the purchase environment-and it is unlikely
   to be considered spontaneously-consumers may overlook it even when
   contemplating purchases of a durable product (for which usage frequency
   is arguably an important purchase criterion). Four studies tested this
   hypothesis. In the first study, most customers of a women's
   everyday-clothing store failed to report usage frequency considerations
   right after making a purchase. In the following three studies, involving
   hypothetical and consequential purchase decisions, manipulations that
   prompted the consideration of usage frequency prior to decision affected
   participants' choices as well as purchase intentions and willingness to
   pay for a product. This suggests that, in the absence of such prompting,
   usage frequency was overlooked. Further, in line with our theorizing,
   the effect of these manipulations faded away when usage frequency cues
   were present in the purchase environment. Future research directions and
   practical implications from our findings are discussed.

AB This research investigates a novel type of fit unique to digital
   marketing: that between the intimacy of an advertizing appeal and of the
   social media platform through which it is advertized. In doing so, we
   challenge the common marketing practice of posting identical content
   across platforms by showing how the same ad is received differently by
   consumers across differing platforms. Consistent with theories of
   processing fluency, we propose that platform-appeal fit (in terms of
   intimacy) enhances consumers' social media engagement with the brand
   because the associated fluency enhances consumers' favorable cognitive
   judgments, affective state, and attitudes. A Pilot Study first maps the
   contours of platform intimacy through multidimensional scaling of
   several popular platforms. The resulting perceptual maps are then used
   to compare consumer response to an intimate or nonintimate appeal posted
   by actual (Experiment 1) and fictitious (Experiment 2) brands on
   platforms of varying intimacy. Results provide evidence for fluency as a
   mechanism for increased engagement following platform-appeal fit,
   suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach to digital marketing may be
   suboptimal in terms of consumer response.

AB Although numerous dual-process models have been brought to bear on the
   cognitive operations that underlie consumer judgment, they are typically
   limited in their ability to capture the processes that occur at
   different stages of cognitive activity and to specify how these
   processes interface. In many (if not most) cases, a mix of both
   automatic and controlled processes underlies judgments and decisions. We
   suggest a theoretical framework that potentially provides an integration
   of these processes and review representative research and theory that
   might be conceptualized in terms of this framework.

AB It is common for charities to bundle donation requests with some type of
   product, such as a tote bag, pen, or coffee mug. The current studies
   find that people are more likely to donate when those bundles are framed
   as "charitable purchases" vs. "donations with a gift." We show that this
   effect arises because consumers want to avoid the negative self-signal
   associated with receiving a gift in exchange for donating. Five
   experiments provide evidence for the role of self-signaling, identify
   key moderators of the framing effect, and demonstrate the downstream
   consequences for people's likelihood of donating in the future. More
   broadly, the current studies lend further evidence to the role of
   self-signaling in charitable giving and provide greater clarity
   regarding how and when different donation solicitation techniques may be
   most effective.

   the effect of salesperson attractiveness on consumer bargaining depends
   on their general beliefs regarding the impact of labor costs on retail
   prices. While consumers bargain less with an attractive salesperson when
   their labor costs-to-price (LP) ratio beliefs are relatively low, they
   bargain harder with an attractive, as opposed to a less attractive,
   salesperson, when their LP ratio beliefs are relatively high. As well,

AB Consumers often wonder about the product's maximum output: the highest
   rotation speed of a blender or the best printing quality of a printer.
   We examine how the number of levels (e.g., a blender with 3 vs. 7
   speeds) influences judgments of maximum product output. Objectively
   speaking, the number of levels is no more than a set of breakpoints in
   an already predetermined continuum from the product's minimum to maximum
   output. Nevertheless, because of the ubiquitous association between
   number of breakpoints and quantity in daily life, consumers do not
   simply view more levels as a signal of greater precision (i.e., giving
   consumers more control over the possible outputs). They also incorrectly
   believe that the product has greater power (i.e., a higher maximum
   output), even when such an inference is in conflict with diagnostic
   attribute information (e.g., watts). A series of five studies documents
   the phenomenon, its asymmetric nature, and its boundary conditions.
   Reliance on the inaccurate "more levels, more power" lay theory weakens
   when participants consider a reduction rather than an increase in number
   of levels, and it disappears when the consumer is presented with an
   explicit relationship between each level and its corresponding output
   value (e.g., level 4:400 W).

AB Banking deserts, vulnerable communities that lack access to mainstream
   banks, represent a serious societal problem. Mainstream banks
   successfully entering banking deserts can help to assuage this problem.
   Drawing from research on the psychological consequences of poverty, we
   propose that mainstream banks can more successfully operate in banking
   deserts by increasing consumers' perception of communal financial
   orientation as a bank benefit (i.e., consumers' perception that engaging
   with the bank is beneficial for their community's well-being). Two field
   studies, comparing customers of a credit union who live in a banking
   desert and those who do not, show that the perception of communal
   financial orientation as a bank benefit increases banking-desert
   consumers' beliefs that engaging with the credit union is beneficial and
   increases their likelihood of patronizing and recommending it; consumers
   living outside banking deserts do not display these effects. These
   findings provide novel insights into psychological mechanisms distinctly
   associated with banking-desert consumers and establish the importance of
   communal financial orientation. This is a win-win proposal for
   under-served communities and financial service providers because it
   helps both improve financial inclusion and increase the viability of
   serving banking deserts.

AB People often fail to achieve health goals, which compromises their
   well-being. Prior research suggests that seeing events through an
   observer's eyes (i.e., adopting a third-person perspective) should
   facilitate goal pursuit. However, we find that third-person perspectives
   discourage goal-consistent intentions and behavior for health goals when
   goal centrality is low (i.e., the goal is peripheral to one's
   self-concept). In Experiment 1, people who adopted a third-person
   perspective chose more sugary foods if they considered a healthy eating
   goal to be more peripheral to the self. Experiment 2 examines why a
   third-person perspective can hinder goal pursuit; it encourages a
   breakdown in implemental thinking which, in turn, increases negative
   self-conscious emotions. While high goal centrality buffers people from
   negative effects on goal intentions, low centrality does not. Experiment
   3 demonstrates that this effect is robust when goal centrality is
   manipulated. We recommend that consumers pursuing health goals (and
   individuals who support them) exercise caution when employing
   perspective-based strategies, as they may backfire for people at
   greatest risk of goal abandonment.

AB Consumer vulnerability affects billions of consumers worldwide, yet
   there is no consensus about what constitutes this state or about its
   consequences for consumers. Indeed, while consumer vulnerability is
   often invoked in consumer research, it is usually discussed informally,
   with little conceptual anchoring. The goal of the current work was to
   advance the field's understanding of consumer vulnerability by (a)
   reviewing and integrating existing research, (b) extracting common
   features to develop a comprehensive framework for the concept of
   consumer vulnerability, and (c) charting paths forward for future
   research. We begin by defining consumer vulnerability as a state in
   which consumers are subject to harm because their access to and control
   over resources are restricted in ways that significantly inhibit their
   ability to function in the marketplace. We then introduce two lenses
   through which to identify this state: experience and observation. Next,
   we delineate the antecedents and consequences of consumer vulnerability
   and discuss the merits of adopting a view of this state as more global
   and dynamic. Finally, we use our framework to offer future research
   considerations.

TI Mix or Match? Consumer Spending Decisions in Conditional Promotions
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1166
EA APR 2020
PY 2020
AB Conditional multi-item promotions are a prevalent marketing tactic
   whereby consumers have to buy a certain number of products to get a
   discount. This paper examines how framing a multi-item promotion in
   terms of savings on multiple items versus a single item (e.g., "buy two,
   get X% off on both" vs. "buy two, get 2X% off on the cheaper item")
   affects consumers' decision-making and product choices. Two laboratory
   studies and a field study at a boutique clothing store demonstrate that
   the "2X% on cheaper" framing makes consumers more likely to select
   similarly priced primary and secondary items. This strategy is driven by
   increased focus on promotional savings under the "2X% on cheaper"
   framing, which leads consumers to spend more on their secondary items.
   Overall, this research shows how a subtle change in the framing of
   multi-item promotions changes consumers' product selection strategies
   and shopping basket composition.

AB Advertisements using assertive language are commonly seen in marketing
   communications, yet assertive language has often been shown to be
   ineffective in communication and even decrease compliance. Recent
   research began to examine factors that influence the effectiveness of
   assertive advertising messages, but little research has studied the
   potential moderating role of consumer-related factors. The current
   research fills this gap by investigating the moderating role of
   consumers' power. Across five studies, the authors find that for
   high-power consumers, assertive ads are effective in promoting want
   products but ineffective in promoting should products. For low-power
   consumers, however, assertive ads are effective in promoting should
   products but ineffective in promoting want products. Moreover, the
   authors show that this pattern of results is driven (mediated) by
   consumers' perception of the fit between the advertising message and the
   advertised product. Theoretical and practical implications of the
   findings are discussed.

AB Surprisingly, little research has examined how consumer responses to

   important gustatory dimension, flavor complexity, varies with the degree
   to which consumers are mentally depleted. Specifically, showing that
   gustatory sensations are more cognitively demanding than previously
   thought, findings from three studies evince that cognitive depletion
   reduces consumer enjoyment of complex-flavored (but not simple-flavored)
   foods via a reduction in pleasure that otherwise can be derived from
   complex flavors. We establish this effect across three different food
   categories and provide preliminary evidence for consumers' ability to
   identify flavors as the underlying process. Our findings offer

EA MAY 2020

AB This research proposes the existence of a hitherto undocumented attitude
   related to food wastage: the attitude of food-waste-aversion. We develop
   a 6-item scale including affective, cognitive, and conative components
   to measure this attitude and empirically investigate its properties in

   scale's convergent validity by demonstrating that it is correlated in
   the expected direction with five theoretically related
   constructs-frugality, social responsibility, spendthriftness,
   self-control, and materialism (Studies 1a and 1b)-and with BMI (Studies
   2 and 3). We provide more indirect evidence of the scale's convergent
   validity by documenting that the link between food-waste-aversion and
   BMI is attenuated among those who practice refrigerating leftovers
   (Study 3). We also document that the food-waste-aversion scale is
   distinct from general waste aversion and external meal-cessation rules,
   thus providing evidence of discriminant validity (Studies 1a, 1b, and
   1c). Taken together, these results provide construct validity for the
   novel construct of food-waste-aversion. We discuss the theoretical and

AB For positive experiences (e.g., when to eat a snack), consumers
   generally prefer to have them immediately, and for negative experiences
   (e.g., when to pay a bill), consumers often prefer to delay. Yet, across
   three studies (plus twelve supplemental studies) we find that
   anticipatory feelings push in the opposite direction, and do so
   differently for positive vs. negative events, leading to different time
   preferences: The desire for immediate positives is stronger than the
   desire to delay negatives. For negative events, anticipatory utility is
   strongly negative, reducing the desire to delay bad things (i.e.,
   consumers want to "get it over with" to minimize the psychological
   discomfort), but for positive events, overall anticipatory utility is
   weakly positive, and therefore does little to reduce consumers' desire
   to expedite good things. This anticipatory asymmetry happens because
   when consumers think about a future positive event, they both enjoy
   imagining it (savoring) while simultaneously disliking the feeling of
   waiting for it (impatience), but when consumers think about a negative
   event, they both dislike imagining it (dread) and dislike the feeling of
   waiting for it. We demonstrate the managerial implications of these
   findings in a pair of field studies using online advertisements for
   retirement planning.

   experiments, that STM enhances one's promotion focus, which increases
   one's approaching tendencies and leads to the preference for actions
   against the status quo of affairs. This effect emerges independently of
   intrinsic product characteristics, such as the risk associated with
   gambling and investment decisions, and the signaling value of
   fashionable apparel. We also demonstrate that, for the STM mindset's
   effect on action-against-status-quo behavior to take place, individuals
   must construe choice sets in the light of default vs. non-default
   options, rather than mere side-by-side comparisons. Accordingly,
   upselling tactics and opt-in offers might be effective implementations

AB The current research examines how goal orientation affects consumer
   preference among products with different prices. We argue that a less
   expensive product may have not only lower perceived quality but also
   greater perceived quality variability. This greater perceived
   variability provides the opportunity for optimistic, promotion-oriented
   consumers to overestimate the quality of the less expensive product.
   This effect is weaker, however, for a more expensive product that
   consumers perceive to have less quality variability and which thus
   provides less room for quality overestimation. As a result, we
   hypothesize that promotion-oriented consumers, as compared to
   prevention-oriented consumers, will demonstrate a stronger preference
   for a less expensive product. In a field study and two laboratory
   experiments, we obtain empirical support both for the hypothesized
   effect of consumers' goal orientation on their product preference and
   for its underlying process. We conclude with a discussion of the

AB Research finds that engaging in prosocial behavior has many positive
   psychological outcomes (e.g., enhanced well-being, optimism, perceived
   control, and a boost in self-concept), and research on monetary
   risk-taking reveals these psychological outcomes are associated with
   increased risk-taking. Merging these findings, we propose that when
   people's volunteering behavior is made salient in their minds, they take
   more monetary risks. Making research participants' volunteering behavior
   salient by having them recall an act of prior volunteering (studies 1
   and 3), choosing whether to volunteer (study 2), or choosing one of two
   volunteering activities (study 4), four experiments (and a fifth
   reported in the Appendix S2) reveal increased risk-taking across several
   monetary-risk outcomes (incentive-compatible gambles, allocation of a
   windfall gain, and a behavioral risk-taking measure involving escalating
   risk). Lastly, when the decision maker attributes a decision to
   volunteer to an external source, the effect of salient volunteering on
   monetary risk-taking attenuates.

AB Consumers frequently make choices and purchase products for other people
   (e.g., buying a gift for a friend). While extant research identified
   many factors that influence how choices for others are made, much of
   this literature focused on product-specific factors or motivations
   pertaining to the process of exchange to understand choice-for-others
   phenomena. Little is known about the influence of consumer-relevant
   factors on choices made for other people. In the current research, we
   examine how choices for others are influenced by consumers' own salient
   personal goals (e.g., to get fit, to succeed professionally). We find
   that consumers choose goal-inconsistent options for others to enhance
   their own perception of progress toward their salient goal. This effect
   is most robust when a salient goal is held at an individual (vs. group)
   level and when the choice-for-other situation exhibits a relationship
   (vs. recipient) focus. Results of seven experiments support these
   claims.

AB This research examines how the weighting of an attribute is jointly
   affected by attribute precision and decision stage. Building on prior
   work suggesting (a) that less (more) precise numerical values are easier
   to process (more accurate), (b) that decision-makers' motivation to be
   efficient (accurate) is greater when creating a consideration set
   (making a final choice), and (c) that decision-makers tend to overweight
   information that is compatible with their goals, we hypothesize that
   when creating a consideration set (making a choice) participants tend to
   assign greater weight to less (more) precise attributes. Five studies
   (two of them reported in the Appendix S1) offer triangulating evidence
   for these predictions. Overall, this work contributes to research on

   weighting, and two-stage decisions.

TI Numbers and Units Affect Goal Pursuit Organization and Motivation
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1179
EA AUG 2020
PY 2020
AB Goals are one of the most ubiquitous drivers of behavior. Despite the
   wealth of research on goal pursuit, less is known about how individuals
   organize their goal pursuit in the first place. This manuscript
   represents one of the first studies to provide insight into quantitative
   goal organization, proposing that the unit/numerical value in which a
   goal is described influences goal pursuit organization. Specifying a
   superordinate goal in units with larger numbers (e.g., studying for an
   examination for 120 min per week), rather than with smaller numbers (2
   hr per week), leads to a goal pursuit structure that consists of more,
   but smaller subgoals. We also find that units with larger compared to
   smaller numbers tend to have a positive effect on goal motivation (i.e.,
   more likely to start the goal earlier and to finish it). Finally, this
   positive effect on goal motivation is attenuated when consumers focus is
   on the number of subgoals left (rather than completed) while pursuing
   the overarching goal. We believe that changing units may be an
   easy-to-implement nudge for anyone (e.g., marketers, managers, public
   policymakers, behavioral therapists) who wants to increase the
   likelihood that individuals use a particular goal pursuit structure.

TI Communication-based Attribute Inference
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1183
EA AUG 2020
PY 2020
AB Consumers often make inferences about an unknown attribute of a target
   (e.g., product quality) from a known attribute (e.g., product price).
   Prior research suggests that such inferences are based on consumers'
   beliefs of interattribute correlations-the higher the value is on
   attribute A, the higher or lower the value will be on attribute B. The
   present research demonstrates that attribute inference can be made in
   the absence of such interattribute correlations if the information of
   the known attribute is acquired through communication. Across three
   studies, I find that information receivers can infer the communicator's
   overall attitude toward a target from her act of conveying her judgment
   of a key attribute of the target, from which they further infer about
   the other attributes, even if these attributes are believed to be
   uncorrelated with the communicated attribute. Supporting this inference
   process, I show that receivers' attribute judgments are mediated by
   their inferred overall attitude of the communicator (Study 1) and are
   unaffected when the communication does not possibly reflect the
   communicator's overall attitude (Studies 2 & 3). These findings
   highlight the unique role of communicated information, as compared to
   consumer's prior knowledge, in consumer inference and word of mouth.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1181
EA AUG 2020
PY 2020
AB Advances in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence
   increasingly enable firms to replace human labor with technology,
   thereby fundamentally transforming how goods and services are produced.
   From both managerial and societal points of view, it is therefore
   important to understand demand-side incentives for firms to employ human
   labor. We begin to address this question by examining for which products
   and services consumers are more likely to favor human (vs. robotic)
   labor. In six studies, we demonstrate that consumers prefer human (vs.
   robotic) labor more for products with higher (vs. lower) symbolic value
   (e.g., when expressing something about one's beliefs and personality is
   of greater importance). We theorize that this is because consumers have
   stronger uniqueness motives in more (vs. less) symbolic consumption
   contexts (and associate human labor more strongly with product
   uniqueness). In line with this account, we demonstrate that individual
   differences in need for uniqueness moderate the interaction between
   production mode and symbolic motives and that a measure of uniqueness
   motives mediates the effect of consumption context on preferences for
   human (vs. robotic) production.

EA AUG 2020
PY 2020
AB Contradicting existing associations between old age and negative
   societal consequences, such as being frail and unproductive, this
   research finds that people contribute more to the greater good of
   society (e.g., by helping strangers in need) when they feel subjectively
   older. We document this phenomenon in both the laboratory and the field
   and find that this heightened desire to contribute to the greater good
   occurs because feeling subjectively older increases consumers' perceived
   responsibility for others' welfare. We further uncover a divergent
   impact of subjective age versus chronological age on giving to distant
   others: Whereas older subjective age increases perceived responsibility
   for distant others' welfare and thus contributions to distant others,
   older chronological age does not. These findings connect the classic
   theories of prosocial behavior with new research on subjective age and
   illuminate a psychological driver that nudges people to take actions
   that benefit distant others.

AB After reviewing prior work regarding components of experience value, I
   present the concept of "Concurrent Experience Evaluation" ("CEE"), which
   expands the prior focus on experienced pain and pleasure in response to
   a stimulus/event. Specifically, the value of an experience is also
   determined by the concurrent (during-the-experience) cognitive
   assessment of the event relative to the person's associated goal
   progress/regression. CEE can account for during-the-experience and
   subsequent choices that people make. Examples of CEE include cognitive
   evaluations that enhance the experience value such as "good for me"
   (while eating kale), "I'm getting my money's worth" (while using a new
   camera), and "I'm having a cultural experience" (while visiting a
   museum), or detract from the experience such as "I shouldn't be doing
   this" (while smoking or overeating) and "should have chosen the other
   line" (while waiting at the supermarket checkout). Although prior
   research has examined hedonic experiences and their context (e.g., being
   with friends, commuting, colonoscopy) as well as what else the mind may
   process during an experience (e.g., wandering, thinking of past and
   future decisions), the concurrent value derived from the cognitive
   evaluation of the goal implications of an experience has not been
   identified as a separate experience value component. I examine and
   illustrate the CEE concept, its determinants, moderators, and
   implications, as well as its distinctive characteristics as compared
   with other value perspectives and during-the-experience mental
   processes. Integrating the CEE framework with prior work regarding
   experience evaluations, I outline a program for future CEE research.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1184
EA SEP 2020
PY 2020
AB The impact of decision difficulty on search behavior depends on the
   relative accessibility of maximize accuracy and minimize effort goals in
   memory. The default assumption, derived from constructive choice theory,
   is that maximize accuracy and minimize effort goals are both accessible.
   Thus, the two goals compete to influence a decision process. When this
   is the case, an increase in decision difficulty discourages search and
   the opportunity to make an accurate decision suffers. The alternative
   assumption, derived from goal systems theory, is that maximize accuracy
   and minimize effort goals can be differentially accessible. When one of
   these goals is more accessible, decision difficulty signals poor goal
   progress and reduces goal pursuit. That is, when a maximize accuracy
   (minimize effort) goal is more accessible, decision difficulty reduces
   (increases) search. Six studies show that goal systems theory holds when
   a maximize accuracy or minimize effort goal is more accessible, that is,
   is deliberately pursued. The results have implications for how decision
   difficulty influences information search, satisficing, and choice
   quality.

AB This research investigates the effects of reminding consumers of their

   parenting strategy to use a child's middle name when disciplining
   him/her after he/she has done something wrong, consumers possess an
   association between "middle name" and "guilt." Thus, exposure to one's
   middle name will automatically trigger feelings of guilt. In turn,
   consumers will engage in consumption that will mitigate this guilt. Five
   studies provide evidence of the proposed association and demonstrate
   that reminders of one's middle name lead to increased guilt and
   decreased preference for indulgent consumption, as well as an increase
   in virtuous behavior. Contributions emerge for the literatures on names
   and self-control.

AB When people make decisions, they want the outcomes of their choice to be
   as positive as possible. But they also want the decision-making process
   itself to be conducted in the right way. Though this is often described
   as making decisions that are moral or ethical, it also includes making
   decisions that are appropriate-that are suitable and fitting. We focus
   on this latter, overlooked interpretation, and propose that making the
   right decision is about effectively establishing what is true and real.
   We discuss three factors that can lead people to experience their
   decision-making process as being right: (1) making a decision in the
   "right way"; (2) making a decision in a manner that "feels right" given
   the decision maker's current motivational orientation; and (3) making a
   decision based upon a "shared reality" with others. We review evidence
   that making the right decision in each of these ways intensifies the
   worth of a given chosen option.

   implementation of regulations applying to firms. Contrary to depictions
   of online sharing behaviors as careless, we show how consumers
   fundamentally care about online privacy, and present evidence of
   numerous actions they take to protect it. However, we also document how
   prohibitively difficult it is to attain desired, or even desirable,
   levels of privacy through individual action alone. The remaining
   instrument for privacy protection is policy intervention. However, again
   for both psychological and economic reasons, the collective impetus for
   adequate intervention is often countervailed by powerful interests that
   oppose it.

   matter" (p. 27)-its role in protecting individual autonomy, freedom,
   dignity, fairness, the collective value of privacy and the integrity of
   social life. Where privacy construed as diffuse, atomistic interests in
   informational control often fails to motivate political action, privacy
   as constitutive of society and in service of "important [social]
   functions" succeeds. While Acquisti et al correctly describe the state
   of our current political economy as having left no space for privacy as
   a lived, intuitive, human practice, we believe those same conditions are
   fostering a resurgence of interest in privacy as a means to address the
   wealth of harms these conditions produce. We close with a call for
   regulatory approaches that develop institutions, tools, and actors that
   can iteratively shape the corporate, social, and political landscape to

AB Privacy is a complex construct: it is not all or nathing, it is based on
   contro over sharing and reuse, it can depend on context, and is
   organized in what is called "circles of privacy." Whether to share
   information is often not a real choice, since sharing is required for
   basic transactions such as obtaining utilities, services, or products.
   Furthermore, scale matters, and information assymetries can quickly
   create playing fields that are not level. Even in these bleak
   circumstances, there is reason for hope that we develop socio-technical
   systems that better align with our values.

EA OCT 2020
PY 2020
AB The current consumer debt epidemic in the United States has prompted
   research on how consumers make debt repayment decisions. Consistent with
   past research indicating that psychological biases affect how consumers
   manage and prioritize debt accounts, we show that a characteristic of
   the number representing the debt amount impacts the speed of debt
   repayment. Across three field studies and three experiments, we provide
   evidence that people are likely to more quickly pay off round-number
   debts (e.g., moderately-sized debt amounts that end in the digits 0 or
   5) than debts of similar magnitude that are not round numbers.
   Furthermore, we show that this effect arises because of the cognitive
   ease of round numbers, which manifests itself in processing fluency and
   retrieval fluency. In addition to documenting this round-number
   advantage, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple and costless
   rounding intervention for helping consumers repay their debts more
   quickly.

TI Why We Don't Rent What Others Love: The Role of Product Attachment in
   Consumer-to-Consumer Transactions
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1193
EA OCT 2020
PY 2020
AB When listing a possession for rent on a consumer-to-consumer platform,
   owners typically write a brief product description. Such descriptions
   often include attachment cues-indications that the owner is emotionally
   attached to the product. How does knowing that an owner is sharing a
   possession that has sentimental value impact rental likelihood? Evidence
   from secondary data and four experiments suggests that although some
   owners mistakenly expect attachment cues to enhance a product's appeal,
   attachment cues instead tend to deter prospective renters. We attribute
   this effect to renters' desire to avoid the responsibility of protecting
   (e.g., from damage, loss, or theft) an item to which the owner is
   emotionally attached. Whereas prior research has examined how product
   attachment influences owners' decisions, we show how an
   owners'expressionof attachment affects others involved in a transaction.
   By refuting the lay theories of some owners about how to attract
   renters, our findings provide practical implications for owners and the
   platforms that connect them to users in the multi-billion-dollar
   consumer-to-consumer rental market.

TI When Sustainability is Not a Liability: The Halo Effect of Marketplace
   Morality
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1195
EA OCT 2020
PY 2020
AB Prior research has suggested that consumers believe that products made
   using sustainable, environmentally friendly technologies are likely to
   underperform those made using traditional methods. We question the
   robustness of this assumption and identify scenarios in which
   sustainability is likely to have the opposite effect, strengthening
   rather than weakening consumers' product performance beliefs.
   Specifically, we argue that sustainability is likely to produce a halo
   effect able to attenuate and even override the negative impact of
   compensatory inferences underlying consumers' belief that sustainability
   comes at the expense of performance. We propose that this halo effect
   stems from consumers' view of the company as a moral agent engaged in a
   prosocial behavior. In this context, we identify two factors that are
   likely to influence the strength of the halo effect: the degree to which
   consumers view the company as a moral agent whose actions aim to benefit
   society and the degree to which moral concerns are prominent in
   consumers' minds. Following this line of reasoning, we identify two ways
   in which managers can increase the perceived performance of sustainable
   products: by associating sustainable benefits with the company rather
   than with its products and by emphasizing the societal benefits of
   sustainability. We test these predictions in a series of four empirical
   studies that show convergent evidence for our theorizing. Our findings
   have important public policy implications, documenting actionable
   strategies that managers can use to mitigate the potential negative
   impact of sustainability and strengthen the perceived performance of
   sustainable products.

TI A Differential Motivation Account for the Disparity between Willingness
   to Accept and Willingness to Pay
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1197
EA OCT 2020
PY 2020
AB We take a motivated reasoning perspective to examine the robust finding
   that a seller's willingness to accept (WTA) to give up a good is
   typically higher than a buyer's willingness to pay (WTP) to obtain the
   good. We propose that the seller/buyer role and/or the WTA/WTP
   elicitation activate different motivations. Four studies, using
   different ways to test for motivational processes, demonstrate how
   motivational processes influence the WTA-WTP disparity in a predictable
   and systematic way. Study 1 shows that the WTA/WTP elicitation activates
   distinct motivations and that altering the medium of exchange reverses
   the motivations. Study 2 shows that eliciting WTA/WTP using an auction
   mechanism activates multiple motivations, attenuating the WTA-WTP
   disparity. Study 3 demonstrates that activating regulatory focus that is
   inconsistent (vs. consistent) with the motivation activated by the
   WTA/WTP elicitation attenuates the WTA-WTP disparity. Study 4
   demonstrates that WTA/WTP elicitation may bias perceptions of an
   ambiguous stimulus and that the WTA-WTP disparity increases with delay.
   Together, our findings provide new insights into the valuation of
   sellers and buyers by highlighting the role of motivational processes
   underlying the WTA-WTP disparity.

AB Consumers often have to make trade-offs between desirable, "more is
   better," and undesirable, "less is better," attributes. What drives
   whether the desirable or the undesirable attributes will be weighed more
   heavily in decisions? We show that the extent to which consumers focus
   on desirable versus undesirable attributes depends on the overall
   attractiveness of their consideration sets. The less attractive the
   options under consideration are-the higher is the weight allocated to
   undesirable attributes, such as price. Three experiments set in the
   contexts of lottery ticket purchasing (study 1), hotel booking (study
   2), elections (study 3), and a conjoint study of online course
   evaluations (study 4) (N = 2,149, p-curve power estimate 90%),
   demonstrate that unattractive sets increase the relative weight of
   "undesirable" attributes (e.g., price of a product, workload of a
   course) and lead to increased preference for options superior on these
   attributes.

TI $100 a month or $1,200 a year? Regulatory focus and the evaluation of

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
DI 10.1002/jcpy.1199
EA NOV 2020
PY 2020
AB The costs and benefits of various products, such as insurance and
   subscription services, are recurring. Marketers can choose to frame
   these attributes either as a series of periodic occurrences (e.g., "$10
   per month") or aggregate them over a longer period ("$120 per year").
   Five studies show that the effectiveness of such temporal framing
   depends on consumers' salient regulatory goals. Compared with
   prevention-focused consumers, promotion-focused consumers are more
   likely to perceive benefits, costs, and losses to be larger when they
   are framed in aggregate (vs. periodic) terms. Mediation analyses suggest
   that, relative to prevention-focused consumers' vigilant information
   processing style, promotion-focused consumers' eagerness makes them more
   susceptible to temporal framing effects. The results suggest that
   regulatory goal is a consequential factor in determining the
   effectiveness of temporal framing.

SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY

EA NOV 2020
PY 2020
AB Millions of U.S. adults join online support groups to attain health
   goals, but the social ties they form are often too weak to provide the
   support they need. What impedes the strengthening of ties in such
   groups? We explore the role of demographic differences in causing the
   impediment and demographic self-disclosure in removing it. Using a field
   study of online quit-smoking groups complemented by three laboratory
   experiments, we find that members tend to hide demographic differences,
   concerned about poor social integration that will weaken their ties.
   However, the self-disclosures of demographic differences that naturally
   occur during group member discussions actually strengthen their ties,
   which in turn facilitates attainment of members' health goals. In other
   words, social ties in online groups are weak not because members are
   demographically different, but because they are reluctant to
   self-disclose their differences. If they do self-disclose, this breeds
   interpersonal connection, trumping any demographic differences among
   them. Data from both laboratory and field about two types of demographic
   difference-dyad-level dissimilarity and group-level minority
   status-provide convergent support for our findings.

EA NOV 2020
PY 2020
AB One of the most reliable and impactful methods for enhancing a
   persuasive appeal is to match an aspect of the proposal (i.e., its
   content, source, or the setting in which it is delivered) to an aspect
   of the consumer receiving it. This personalized matching in persuasion
   (also called tailoring, targeting, customizing, or personalizing)
   comprises a robust and growing literature. In the present review, we
   describe different types of persuasive matches, the primary
   characteristics of people who are targeted, and the key psychological
   mechanisms underlying the impact of matching. Importantly, although most
   research on personalized matching has concluded that matching is good
   for persuasion, we also describe and explain instances where it has
   produced negative (i.e., "backfire") effects. That is, more than just
   the conclusion "matching is good" that many researchers have drawn, we
   analyze when and why it is good and when and why it can be
   ineffective-insight that can benefit marketers and consumers alike in
   understanding how personally matched appeals can impact attitudes and
   ultimately behavior.

AB Social movements, such as Black Lives Matter, surge when support grows
   for their social justice goals. At their core, social movements advance
   when people act collectively by rising in solidarity with a shared
   purpose to address injustice and inequality. Drawing on insights from
   consumer psychology, this review investigates how social movements
   succeed in creating social change. We build on an established
   21(st)-century framework for how social movements succeed to outline the
   promising practices of successful social movements. For each of these
   practices, we identify the consumer psychology mechanisms that motivate
   collective action and encourage people to transform from bystanders to
   upstanders, those who provide the grassroots momentum for successful
   social movements. We illustrate this framework with examples from the
   growth of the Black Lives Matter movement. Finally, we highlight
   insights from consumer psychology that promote an understanding of
   social movements, and we raise research questions to encourage more
   consumer psychologists to investigate how social movements succeed.

AB People experience the world through distance perceptions, such as
   perceiving distance when moving through store aisles, locating movie
   theater seats, spotting parking spaces, or navigating airport gates. The
   distance can be perceived using qualitative (e.g., letter) or
   quantitative (e.g., number) cues. In this research, we focus on how the
   type of cues can influence consumers' distance perceptions and affect
   their everyday judgments. Specifically, we suggest that in pretask
   estimates (referred to as the preaction stage), letter cues lead to
   lesser distance perceptions. However, in posttask estimates (referred to
   as the postaction stage), letter cues lead to greater distance
   perceptions. We explain the result pattern in the preaction stage using
   naive beliefs about the ease of computation and magnitude judgments
   (i.e., computational fluency). In the postaction stage, we propose that
   expectation-disconfirmation causes such a reversal in distance
   perceptions. We test the proposed patterns of results and theoretical
   accounts across two laboratory studies and two field studies.

EA JAN 2021

AB The notion that people's choices reveal something about who they are is
   fundamental to theories of self-perception, self-signaling, and

   present research explores how the relative ease or difficulty of

   people perceive themselves to be more likely to make similar choices in
   other situations when their choices feel relatively easy rather than
   difficult to make. This is because people perceive choices to be more
   diagnostic of who they are when they feel relatively easy. Moreover,
   people consider their choices to be especially self-diagnostic when
   their own choice ease or difficulty differs from the ease or difficulty
   they expected most other people to experience. Together, these findings
   suggest that consumers come to understand their preferences not just
   from what they choose, but also from how easy or difficult those choices

EA JAN 2021
PY 2021
AB Consumers commonly encounter products with descriptors. Descriptors with
   meanings understood by consumers clearly affect judgments of the
   described products. However, can descriptors for which consumers do not
   know the word's semantic meaning (as is increasingly common in a
   globalized world) still affect judgments in systematic ways, via
   altering the product's perceived prototypicality? We examine two kinds
   of judgments that typically move in the same direction, but which we
   propose are affected by prototypicality in opposite directions: (a)
   judgments of how expensive the product is and (b) expectations of the
   subjective quality of the product. Four experiments show that
   meaningless descriptors lead consumers to assume that a product is a
   less prototypical version in its category, increasing price judgments
   but decreasing quality expectations. Altogether, meaningless descriptors
   lead to more negative attitudes toward products. This research thus
   sheds light on the impact of encountering descriptor words with unknown
   meaning, showing that encountering such words does not lead to the
   typical effects wherein factors that lift price judgments also lift
   quality expectations.
